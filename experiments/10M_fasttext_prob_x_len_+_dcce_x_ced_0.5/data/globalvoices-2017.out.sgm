<seg id="6">"as 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who came with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-student, who had the top of the court with judges, who had to inclined his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was "s, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year, which I lived in Arizona, had only enhanced my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you can always be of, you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm love of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with its bottling-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops along the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and says publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in it for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he had won at the Republican pre-elections, was the highest number one by the nomination of nomination."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigra Person and asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of Journalismusere, people from all over the world, which I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the trumps that do not coincide with the Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix "" watch the game. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"the intolerance is also at contrast to generosity which I lived at Sandy Bahr who fought for the environment for life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she adapts her to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who embodied through them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump down his way to nominated Republican presidential elections, they offered me a grip and the counterpart of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly wheat, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlooked these things, broke me nearly the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what we have led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of which have been voted for Trump, because they want to win over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, perhaps they wanted to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to overlook a man who look down to those who look different from contempt."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" whitelash "(m.).: as much as" Accelongation of the White against all other ethnics, "words from the white in Anplayung on the White and whiplash, as it was the great Van Jones, exactly what the America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, by choosing Donald Trumps, however, a gigantic portion of the white Americas gives this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the Ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton had had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain of Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan."</seg>

<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs use and the gangs of violence."</seg>

<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local oist and musician instructor, the children of Cateura, are reminded of the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place that the parents worked in the garbage. the children do not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something was shown that he had never seen before: one from waste-established violin.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wilde illegal fishing fights.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted solutions on international, practicing solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs during an agreement with Global Voices on sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, that this vessel had already operated illegal fishing waters before it sought out the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were astonished accordingly, and little inclined, to welcome a legislative crusher of this kind to their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comers, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refuse to give him one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "Ursuddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries which you simply reformed everything", "remember Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the kenian fishing authorities. he is part of a team who discovered the ship and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"at the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protected, FISH-i Africa is a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, who had driven back the prime minister of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, it is hidden because of it is extremely difficult. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species can be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while action against illegal fishing hurdles were once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail, the actions occur today in real time, with traceable on the FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other lists of existing licenses, news on suspected activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port spection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships that are in the botched areas. also, such suspected driving routes can be discovered, such that a ship loads his furious fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish-licence, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships could not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay by penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leiding director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales by losing its eight members of the network at HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate in East-African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms that attracts the region of commercial fisherman from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include such practices such as the sailing under false flag, fake license terms, indication by phantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately use the lack of international co-operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-bounded control system, "says Long." "formerly a ship could illegal fishing and a country could say" You dared my harbour. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and this exact slack tried FISH-i now to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to date the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks being exposed to counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted ships and found it whispered ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authorities to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into networks organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that is intended to help FISH-i, suspected ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps to keep the illegal ships coming up."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"for instance, some of the ships are able to switch their automatic identifier systems, which they can no longer be saved from satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system which connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team in African nations do not influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the World Protection organisation Oceana. a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by the position of every single-traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join forces to get a better idea of who what is doing - this is simply meaning," "says he." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system uses the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminal, but they also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been confiscated with no license earlier and hardly having consequences to reckon they know they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the participating countries involved in FISH-i participating countries now have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fisherman boats bought more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped to send Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board tow, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, some hundreds of millions of dollars disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, 2015 six countries have joined together, so called West Africa Task Force. they now fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With safety the goal is to develop even more of such initiatives and structures also in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's recently started his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was travelling under false flag. and not only was the ship used without licence and were used in tow, which is now forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into the bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take-up rules against Greko 1 set out a strong sign that they attack against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success by many. and at the same time proof that such a particular, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the whole world sea.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to get over, one needs two important skills: passive knowledge of knowledge to understand the initial text and to engage actively in the target language."</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language, the translations into the translation process. this may be attributable to lack of understanding for overlapse or relatively small number of English speakers, from Japanese language."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who do not have foreign employees, translations nonetheless have their internal staff, then the Japanese staff, whose English skills are made to be the best, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>

<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrens and puzzling propositions which are created by machine translation, show that this technique does not replace any human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the most enigmatic prints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are used only from stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all."</seg>

<seg id="692">"youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important for them. they do this through Hip Hop, thanks to a number of migrant workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour has been launched for 2014 Workshopper mobile audio studios directly at schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups in songwriting, recording, audio and video-products and live appearances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop raises the fact that the young participants in discussions are topics such as" "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self acceptance", "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the youth are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the kiteskalum First nation in British Columbia tells example the history of the Highway 16, also" Highway of the tears, "a road-section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>

<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to convey to how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite influences by globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always master the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation was recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop Hop Group which gave them a crop in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebookallside of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in upheavals, as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>

<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there is hardly anyone looking for the funeral or on the churches that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone, behind each bone, in the hundreds of married tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never cure."</seg>
<seg id="753">"that is why the Mexican news site animal político supports the digital project" Aprena Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "with drug trading,") to give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people who were told in the struggle between the prosecutor authorities and cartels. "</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprena vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of the international community. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility, and the prosecution."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it reminds us that violence should never consider normal to be normal, regardless of what type it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and Sensationsjournalism I have been known for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come past every day with newspaper kiosk and see the title pages with images, which actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the redeemed or sad. it affects how a lack of respect for the person who was once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year's cousin thinks that he is big. and it's also not normal that people listen songs about the" heroism "of offenders, when going through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me that is, as if they overtones those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they happen."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to blown numbers in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of humans is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighboring village thus justified that they were up.</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they remain spared by such tragedies when they are not stirred and silently.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" four months of extortion in the capital city. it describes how armed criminals was released for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business, but also their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and about how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="796">They included their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you do not know when they will discharge or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, whether tears would dissolve my deep feelings, but the reply is no, because I have forgotten how to cries. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the violence marked by violence.</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction he raises questions about: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents worry about it."</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a washing and he told that he had to teach himself how to cook a broiled potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies which are living with him. this is his name for the preparation of flukes with water, sugar and dairy powder. "</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year's life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"however, they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said to him that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been past two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"as Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">The bryan was born in 2006 as a violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of judges for public security and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand-stories stories about organized crime in Mexico and penetrate that into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live in view of the headlines. this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprena Vivir Con El Narco "," Animal Político 2015 provides the data journalism project Narcodata to form the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in comprehensible way.

<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 the fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities on which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corruptions were located in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people have been massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"however, the numbers could not be confirmed." "nobody stayed back to count corpses," "said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many have been crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the following time could be shown."</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo can be found once more than proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was taken as a testament to massaging.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General-General Office of the Republic, which led the application, there would be no barriers to Cambaza, back to his old post, as the firm has no discipline as after his detention."</seg>

<seg id="1262">"represents the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a reluctance with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also have a disciplining procedures against the negotiators.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company seem to be and prompted no proper legal action to apply the appropriate functions."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the renowned Social Network took their posts out of the net, because they played the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people east indian origin or in general as adjective" indian "." "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "in-out scripts) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radial nationalistic movements gave the word an extremely detergenous cannotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word which is used mostly by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"nowadays, Kalar'may usually be associated with racism but the word in itself is not automatically called Hasslanguage."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also hersts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed the purpose of his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burmesan words with fundamental meanings which have the same character as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmically as' Kalar htaing 'written, which contains the same letters as also other words as' Kalar Pae '(Spentbse), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends on spiritual nature whether he knew how to relieve his back pain, leaving a word playing."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the Frageword (la) in Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they will reduce Hasslanguage radicalised nationalists, but also that Facebook will be analytical, before it disseminate all posts that emerged in suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation is not understood what you can write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the words above.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (Spentbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that this dirtier nationalists to spread the speech, a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to circumcised their nationalism at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that may spread the speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have demonstrated that the censorship of keywords often becomes a pot and mouse game, whereby the users use social networks simply to begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the zenith to express their views. "</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook began to delete his posts, as he only wanted to tell his friends that the word" Kalar "is banished by social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post office to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the lyrics, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook community standards did not meet."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions, or who simply try to show their opinions against the leaders of radical nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post he told his opinion about why the extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more on Facebook before the start of the initiative - for example the Burmic Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intent to decrease racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words must censored only even more hate inside the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"moreover, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have so words such as" "chair" "or" "hersencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found it out that they made mistakes, they tried not to correct the misunderstood Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only little respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a big turnover, this would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic zensorship has provided a lot of spill among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users talk about Facebook funny and consciously writing the word 'Kalar' not in the context of speech to see whether their posts are taken from the grid."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts, which had no hate speech, but nevertheless removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to broaden their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, Hasslanguage should in social networks maintain the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists were forced to escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was used for his failure to criticize over-over people on his burry sides under control.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, there are women with great care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" "father of my child." ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure to respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state Odisha and construed by their family and the village community after having raised a messed relatives by name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of wives also not to name their wives, is also common among men. however, they are far less common to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare, and housewives, a unique club, and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the reduction of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pahas been working with the aid of practices for seven years with the aid of practices, such as children's homes to connect HIV- and AIDS-Infied, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they have made them at the same time to ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion, was of women who did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has chosen for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of their spouses is not according to the utterance, is a Brother who is maintained all of an agreement and never asked questions."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman, which does not hold this is considered to be deposited, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never thought about this discussion, and have never thought about it."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning of the rough, Rohini has never had called the name of her husband to try out at home with her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband rods even long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"internash, my husband, turned to me and said, I would call him from now on with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage started Rohini their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchate "never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the videoprojection, the women examined the discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, meaning that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day before they brought the name of her spouses to the lips," says Rohini Pawas out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women will never be able to speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise, she decided throughout the exercise; another decided to step up the whole stripped frustration against him and his family to curse him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient fires, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Rohini has received a variety of reports over the next few days.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband called a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women into the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she joined, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arose in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"in Rohini, how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred spot on the forehead, which shows the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred spot if he also works."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I listened to him to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women do not have stopped fully with it, but mean, they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the debate is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we do a trip with every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"usually, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I do not want to make the women worry who what could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthday with cakes; they danced and sangen and spoke about things that they had never thought about.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have talked about some things, for example, such as our identities to our spouses, have never been as honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and as it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have worn only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a salat-spa, a broad shirt over a pants, wearing; they have not drunk."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion on the merits of their own closeness, morals connected to the Saris and much more, dress her own pair of Kurtas (upper hemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry it."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans, and Rohini is sure to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since their first panel has changed something, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have done only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listening to them again to say the name of their spouse."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some who included myself, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the craving for more freedom of movement or their own closeness - lying in the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes to the club and other people who are talking about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from well-reaching groups in India and make videos about stories about which not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly because Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shangrgam, Singapore was regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International Association of the Bar Association of New York, the minister of New York noted that many people were criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because Singapore compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is it, whereby most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a town.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "rotate the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that we don't want to be a land."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the form of escape from the responsibilities, a compulsory."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons of Shangrgam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one can't measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal lands', given that, it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old body of the authoritarian rulers appear to be democrat, leave the twisted logic, as they fit better into their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end of the last week of Shangrgam, answers to his American guests were given to our press, our Judicative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions taraped with non-answers rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to make his opinion clear because it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to what country is our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangrgam would take the effort to clear this point, unless he was paid to be part of the Government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by reading Anon on the blog, he pointed out the critiques to read the full signature of the conference so that in order to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, in which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said, Singapore was rather a" "city" "as a country," he said why the elections in Singapore was so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">In Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party of decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore was not a land," he obviously does not meant to be meant in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shangrgam who is as leaders of a hergrowing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, I am very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - do I do with them or not, but that is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shangrgam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is defending and aware of what he defended."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review submitted the severity of Shangrgams Argumers:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam "welled a mistake" or was it a freelancer?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the administration, the statements of Mr. Shangrgam are of grave significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the clubs and their military service do they defend their military service, but they do not defend their country but not their land?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom does our Prime Minister invoices pay?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink recruitment?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade for Bejahung, Singapore is and always was a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say, what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have annoyed a lot of the Longians...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We always have a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We always were a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" defending the country especially "" etc. "" but this is not quite true. "</seg>

<seg id="2081">I decided to lay down myself again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which occurred to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to dawn.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the light filled the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of an exhaustive young:" "my Lord, my Father must worry horrible."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Rapordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time inside, sometimes slender to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which had been part of them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family were forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years Hdaib is an impassioned activist who raises the conservative majority and asks their old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often deal with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues do not only find in his hometown Amman Relevance but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement by men who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he is not open to the US, he swept a particular slope against the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe its sympathy for those who try to do in war-areas, anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian-fleeting of the second generation, "even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think because of my own life circumstances, says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think that, because I am a human, "while he shook down in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also means that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do hot with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the sutch lukewarm coffee and the weakest of the Kent cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"today, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - in order to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has told a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordal branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsartery is contrary to the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for the concert hall.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" because of the sexual orientation of the scary.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many pretend that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that arises the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila the jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights "are committed to campaigning for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not simply be the rhetoric, but indeed a more evident reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional sex-men to lend a body by formed his vision of the destiny of Arab women who have prefabrication sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an evidently unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs stretch themselves up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who they actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'Honmorale' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch recognized that the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure still lacks to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence, in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to intra-family violence," and for their release is often a long-called bureaucratic effort, and the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary that the woman will have nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known, also not to return to subjects that have lived in his country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib bests that his work is political, but that he is his music, the full explicit assination to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became policy." "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawyal 3aib "and" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs which are in the core political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words," what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heteroso- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily ensored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya to see later his comments from the context had been demolished and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but he was only an edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open for the Arab LGBTQ + community, and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals did not meet Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who later should work on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordi do not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hazelian Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanian message merged several former government-members and members of the teacher association, with the reasoning, they had expressed critical about the problems in social media with deep deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, according to the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan hat Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row a performance, but the way of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, bedding and internal changes. it is certain that these changes are taking place from day to day at the heart of the jordanic society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, as millions of other Arabs also dreams, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streumunitions and on artificial species through guided democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is time, Hdaib will continue and also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2152">"you suspect that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of tobeech. another theory outlay down the drums, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years away from the west to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region to force the emmishi into the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution of" "love-ships to Guerillakim", "published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry will be published in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love-craving to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who have engraved, affection to them?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question was about the two young Colombian activists from the Young-Youth activists from the Young Youth Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write to guerrilla warfare."</seg>
<seg id="2186">First Shem was their land swing of an historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the Guerillabewter FARC (German: revolutionary forces Columbus) which forms the closing point of the longest conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was devoted to the signing of the peace contract as so significant, that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, before the Colombian, there is a long way to speak from a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a military rhetoric and they had to integrate their arms around the clock, and have to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear of fear and in some cases, it has to record them into their ranks and support them when building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians would have to join and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love-ships on former guerrilla fighter to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter, which should be transferred personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the possibility to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day of the love-craving, but those forget that they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told to share his love with people this year, which were most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was created, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC who now must find their place in society and build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Columbus such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I had never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN-camps in the Caldono region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation in the camp to overtake the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of FARC stood up, as they did previously, to assume the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters full of sub-protecting people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different emotions you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between, "said the political knowledge-student Manuela Jiménez Avila."</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca drive this unforgettable experience so: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighter caused me by the camp of the Guerilla-fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw into one of the" "Cambuches" "(a type of cottage, in which the guerrilla fighter live), I saw an guerrilla fighter, who wrote a little."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid of responding, because beside him on bed lay a MGL garatcher, a deadly weapon in the thorn-silk."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said him nevertheless and asked," "Hello, what do they do?" "I answered," "I answered my letter I have written."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life, someone has written me something so beautiful, therefore I quickly responded to it. I suddenly got the tears of the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him quite quickly and sat down beside the Granatcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. he had never thought of staying in FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers in front of hunger." I would have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society that is waiting with open arms to us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to start-up, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion panel."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all grown up as war and the FARC already acted in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of FARC explores the history of the organization, its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" many years we have experienced how the social injustice by the State on the whole Colombian people have experienced. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can help create society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for the purpose of this size order it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never found hearing, and they had no choice, and to realize that people often seen as monsters and even hate even people with beautiful feelings, which were reversed by their livelihoods and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage can give us something, and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the Commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians was published that after the draft peace was reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to raise the weapons and protruding their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we are putting on the FARC now to peace, to a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call on all defenders of peace regardless of which race, religion or ideology - to raise themselves about all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2248">"the first report was released by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gaseta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechnyan authorities, the suspected queer men, and put them in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina: a transwoman was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was awakening, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechnya had experienced horsemen of their landlady, the hunt was opened up to Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">It was fear of fear for her life in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as an honorary helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone took my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman that arose in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, he did a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he wicked them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there's no men more in Chechnya who can solve this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents made the round of WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just there, a few shopping centers were brought forth from the backseat of my car, I heard a man's voice:" "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned myself, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard one sentence, but this time on my chet:" how long do you still want the family to fab, you Schandfleck? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>

<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything and started to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keyrings in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name dron: but the doctor promised and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his brush for the first time, I got to do it with fear; it was a muslimixer, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful for him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got drones.</seg>

<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded me to send me to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>

<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she lay down a strike to the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately they came to neighbours and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to a flat and a few hours later I found a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that there was a little lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My manogiler friends audited the numerical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then it happened somewhat uncredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without register without my ID, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checs into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered in a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think about, you are warming in security, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, to which hotel you steckst. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my roomnumber.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the sex even, this is a spreadsheet theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukasy elements I still carry in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"therefore, I also wish it to overcome these spiritual barrier I can not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble like the person who reminds them out of their past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have remained intact?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has put up one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so that I mean, they probably invite the relative to those who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced by blood commissions."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still going for men in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it was just not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have not left a rich relative or were dropped by their relatives, to face Kadyrows judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should it be brought, you will show off their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked some village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but specifically submerged to radiate yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just liked someone who was detained one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard has grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just taken them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandits, and there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"why otherwise, one could not have allowed these people to shave?"</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always took my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe that before 2003 I was already known in Grosny than I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">To the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us back to" "civil society", "but ultimately caused us to be discarded into the stone age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrow have been exhausted; I had colored eyelashes, tubejeans and short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the sharia never warped to me even just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people as I met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been instructed.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is called "Spotte not over the misfortune of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children if those are funny over the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never denied me never failed and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnadensage thought?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on morals on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how the people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had chained and slaughed, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic has been rising steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earned not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"that apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, arrivals, I accompanying them to the hospital and help them to get food types."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself as I dismiss hiding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim ma and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you bear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is a drivers.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no swelling at them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cables have which, the Russians have also what; on the entire planet it gives them - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I am coming from there, that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I come here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"know many thinking about Transience to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truthful."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be precise, different way of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"not, whether I have a partner or not."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now last longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2411">"the region, in which a large part of Iran living in Iran living in the Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to deny it to the native Arab population."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with the feminism, also with the intersectionals"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and originally posted on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, acting many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought quite well thinking scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for instance, in spite of the same education, women still deserve less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women meet sooner or later in various fields of life to a glamorous ceiling, and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that and I am less than twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBT community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I talk, how we have always been mentioned under segregation and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, make a lot of white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all women agree that women - all women should come together to sing" their voices and "Kumbaya," my lord 'to sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualized violence, an institutionalized violence there is an institutionalized violence that we are exposed to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin areas earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls are referred to school with a migration background to the school as a white girl because of the obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed to a higher risk of women with an immigrant background, or that women are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as a white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want to have all women, all the men and all men who have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider myself as a black woman, in their center the white woman, who refuse to consider injustices in their thinking, which refers both to the gender and to the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I have exhausted, and I will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminialist-oriented spammers who repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner said in 1851 in their speech," "am I not a woman?" "and even I refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized nature."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb through cultural expropriation of our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to put white women the importance of burning skin colour and gender. because some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectionalist feminism was founded in order to give women from different origins and abort yourself from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I am afraid of getting rid of the feminism and close me of the feminism, which was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than a white-feminist paradigm which is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it's more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embarking us into the spheres, which will be created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weem, who we can defend ourselves (approximately: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which we can defend ourselves in this way, where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired, which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately retrieval separatism and exclusion, after they read these lines, ask about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can distinguish black women and women of other cultures, as there existed in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"" "I will be acknowledged because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# soft-Semiconductors) that reports on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been modified to protect people affected.</seg>

<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking up the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are reported at all once, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also dependent on the men who misuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Extracts and Statistic 2 Invisible Missions and a judicial system, which has nothing under nimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, deficient conversion of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really misunderstood, says Myrian González, research for genderwonder at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social-scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various references and reports, but not even ansatzweise the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures currently available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Office-Office 9600 ads were part of domestic violence. at 70% of this, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the adverts with the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in peace. also here came 86% of the adverts of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they have been physically fighting, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women's Minister, Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these crimes." to any woman who will be refunded in Paraguay for psychic missive display, 9 women who do not do so. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman, which is refunded because of physical abuse, two women will not do," "declared it at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's icide in Paraguay have no own prosecutor, the prosecution bodies cannot be adequately documented, how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone until August 2016 journalists had at least 12 cases of women's genocide in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible distracts and a judicial system that is nothing lower</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, insisted that she called his name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she did not want it, but then she did."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she carried the psychic force of my part, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time, recognisable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have been the victim of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier this, I always thought that that only women happens to be subservient because it is deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name names, she wrote posts on Facebook where they described his leases and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she liked it so long by Carlos and left him no earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse at least had some complicity to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences to listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"their wealthy partners made it finally, to convince them that they worthless."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this entry by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental issues worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company has 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant which is cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years of work, Mortons of work was done only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many salami he can get, limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not use them for their purpose."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only for single varieties, but also for certain properties such as resilience to diseases, a special red or green tone or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the last few years, more and more such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cartels. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as an impassioned representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, but he now needs longer because his work is ever more complicated by ever more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if lying in a river a rock brock, around whom I have to pump."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding of tradition," he says. "I think that this patents go far at Salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand up court, no one can breed for a new salute, because all the features are patented and tried to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as the intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the international space station ISS have red tube salat the Sorry Outreddish in the" "greenhouse" "station and eaten there if plants can be cultivated in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement originate from the IT-area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for Open-Source" "seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyright software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">She was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, shortly Ossi is called, US-breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seed of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only permit others who breed their seeds, to breed, and not immediately uttering - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patente or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Prospects for prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Vorwerk, Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays him according to a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to utilise the latter or only little by breed seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasizes that the" open source "movement is not busy with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, who, in August or September 2016, we need to know how it is used on farm markets, should also know that the way it is bred based on farms."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritious without seed-sovereign is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to providing others their seeds at the disposal. thus you are to be patent in contrast to seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-Supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk, since the available gene pool due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted to shrink."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD's work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found that about one third of all the cartridge features are protected as intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either at all or only."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suggests that massy-built plants such as wheat in the greatest style are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they are targeted targeted features - from such, by which their taste or colour increases up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as vermin or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patties on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders are increasing by ever more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, since changing conditions are worse forecasted by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail monsanto-speaker Carly Scaduto indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities. with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company has committed to maintaining the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it does not contradicts that intellectual property other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varities innovate. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, once the patent is expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions can help others to get to the same result with another method."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection impedes innovations not, but encourages them to be made available to the public with more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait, until a patent has been drafted, certainly not innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for so long, to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and remain to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monotonous incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible to make us impossible if we continue to use the best and the latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton had to be patched by the concept in itself, plant-characteristics:" we are not really creating the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants consist of themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi Member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who is a sorcerous breed, also respects his own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with big courtyards and monocultural are needed for their cultivation of herbicide by growing the concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precisely tailored. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than monsanto are) patents have to survive; either they just sit down the patent or they hold it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is searching for in his stallion Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of Plant-based innovative would:" "it looks like being with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patrol."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years themselves," says he. "with a patent you are 20 years before competition, what makes it really beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept grew quickly but quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an open-source" seed plant. "to preserve the seed plant and helps them to breed new varieties, which meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken over.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016 the executive committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent application, patents on conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"a statement is still not a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States, to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" "Open Source" "seed systems, that the organization is currently an international alliance for" "Open Source" "seed systems, for the planned next year of the official start signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"merger of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group to erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essens - a Verbund from the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published. in it represents that farmers have the possibility to exchange and improve the seed policies to ensure a stable supply of foods."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of diverse, local supply and seeds for sustainable food safety systems - a connection, by the Luby of Ossi hopes that it will soon become more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially respect where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we now try to keep the people clear that even more behind their food is. "</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first drained website of an human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities block more than two months of 21 websites, the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking issue of Huffington Post, and from Qatar to Qatar."</seg>

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo calendar, spent nearly 500 days in captivity when he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces, as he reported about the student protests, and recorded a video as the police force physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the blocking through the government and reflect what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"however, to block blogs are very old, however, has in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs might not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It succeeded to give me the feeling of a reward management; a arrest, a sucking murder, unloading of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I did not have nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence even if only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to items of items to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>

<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to block the content and to filter information to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation becomes additional, in addition, that the censurches will be met behind closed doors, thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis that they can preach the court against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers show newspapers in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>

"this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could complicate it to account responsibilities in the police."</seg>
