this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New @-@ York Times .
&quot; long before anyone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the N@@ SA are illeg@@ ally inter@@ cep@@ ted by Americans . &quot;
it is but another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
therein he described a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service in which the CIA is literally covered for an atomic bom@@ b for an atomic bom@@ b .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , you can read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
&quot; but do you know , whom this chapter was not gone ? &quot;
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government called against R@@ isen and asked him to name its alleged sources .
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and to study journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones , which they can be reasonably priced . &quot;
&quot; so when the government came to R@@ isen , he did something , what many brave re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused , and said he would rather go to the prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , happened slightly extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though she had for years of claims that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can always be hidden .
&quot; instead of failing to fail and isen with claims , that could also carry out its digital foot@@ prints . &quot;
&quot; and in this way the investig@@ ators , without its consent , express their phone numbers , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his loans , and even fri@@ ction with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and cr@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect his lawyer , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all the U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too secret from their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since 11 September , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we thus set the press work in the game that should be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more possibilities to sp@@ y all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they can get that from the moment in which they contact , instead of entering into witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has@@ n &apos;t been written as R@@ isen his book was written , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transm@@ itter system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I am working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can download documents , or send information to your usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; this will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only the relevant news agency . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer provide information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they claim would not be available . &quot;
&quot; but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are constantly developing new sp@@ y technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to evi@@ den@@ ess offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we can protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the over ab@@ norm@@ alities when supplying to soldiers from modest , and crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for si@@ gh@@ ing water of F@@ lin@@ t defe@@ ats . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 . April 2016 the largest dat@@ l@@ eck of the story published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; was hiding as the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; was hidden . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to be a statement . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a lat@@ ch of 11 million documents of the law firms in Panama based law firm . &quot;
the publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up the setup ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has resign@@ ed .
there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad brief@@ ing companies in tax hav@@ ens has .
&quot; it claims that a track record from 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads , through a close friend of inf@@ ants , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous the next release , and the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agency or an John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
&quot; it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this lead us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , this unvei@@ ls are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , like secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few minutes to hide their assets and wear -- something that we have been discussing and enth@@ used for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think , many people will see this whole world very confusing , and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
presum@@ ably because it has hitherto no prominent American issued in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not so that there are no enough Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; could we have had a collection of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have a lot more cases and examples that have links to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to create a company than to obtain a libr@@ arian credit card . &quot;
&quot; this type of in@@ transpar@@ ence in the US has allowed the employees of school@@ bor@@ es , to cut school children . &quot;
&quot; it has frau@@ ds allow , especially to cut off investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
&quot; here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks . &quot;
how does that work ?
so we sent an un@@ covered entry into the offices of 13 criminal companies in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave itself as African minister , the suspected money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked , that all will be made up to an attorney at our investig@@ ator &apos;s proposals , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre @-@ pre@@ aches . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course anyone was handed over to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has been subject to our un@@ covered proposals .
&quot; it is not about a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this might sound very smoothly sound , as if we could do anything against it : as if nothing had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as well @-@ born Optim@@ ist I really see that some changes have begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen precau@@ tions to greater transparency where the owners of companies are concerned .
the subject found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then the EU has been gathered in central regi@@ stran@@ ts at the national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; the representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ count . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and end it , by laws to end this type of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finish the in@@ transpar@@ ence that now allow this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally finish . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maced@@ oni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my designer , I made a back @-@ home . &quot;
a guy in the red ma@@ a@@ Maz@@ da have been standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; where do you work for today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a bedroom on a bedroom ?
&quot; but I did not know him just yet ! he says he would go to the peace of grain , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maced@@ land ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard that : &quot; I have a li@@ lo . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; h , how do I pray ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh dear . what did I feel like in me ? &quot;
a wild estr@@ ang@@ ement in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of bed , on tenth pointed to the door , and my sleeping door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe people were sold to me as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air conditioning , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a long leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ aster , my ro@@ ommate attracts off and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference at that time . all the hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ant Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have translated as we can earn something to do . our apartment will stay for a designer bed and breakfast . young designers are able to stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air@@ mat@@ tresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happ@@ ier guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollar on the bub@@ ble ground on wooden floors .
they thought it was great and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we were touring with them throughout the city . as we had passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , star@@ red Brian and I went to . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came into the roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate @-@ inhabitants , N@@ ate Blech@@ arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a site , on the people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , whose doors you are closing when visit . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can invite people to spend the wild people with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
&quot; no one who is still con@@ sol@@ ation for con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business , stran@@ gers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one gets on the things that you can do well . we were able to f@@ end . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to take objects up , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who had never met before . &quot;
to make design such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a cost of tasting what degree we have done .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ umbs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ err@@ ated cell phone sharing your left seat .
this quiet filling of panic that you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
&quot; for the only thing that is still more personal than your mobile phone , your home is . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most are the responsibility .
you also feel the most guests when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just sometimes who has actually Al Gor@@ es Handy ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he urged for the office of the president ?
you can now return the mobil@@ es now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour could be introduced only once with his name ; if he told , wh@@ ence he does come as his dog or his children ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents that would say : &quot; he can really see very well pro@@ oted mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens the confidence key .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to prevent adverse ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed down their assignment , before we asked them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
little surprise we trust the people most who are most pleas@@ ing us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social occurrence .
exciting is it if you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents that nothing changes .
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation @-@ suff@@ oc@@ tions from .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
&quot; moreover , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are cheaper . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you feel too little , as for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you can tell a lot , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; T@@ olle works of your apartment ! &quot; &quot; I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to establish this degree in openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards foreigners .
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the great crowd of people who were more than willing to submit these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
see how many people use our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the inde@@ fati@@ g@@ able work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that was not covered before . &quot;
the business is running very well for us .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have been un@@ allowed part@@ ys and have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
I worked on my phone at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it is hur@@ ting if I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the anus , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , by the 123 million mid @-@ sized nights only a fraction ever had a problem . &quot;
for people trusted each other to justice .
&quot; if confidence works , it can be awesome . &quot;
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him into the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers , which tend to be contracted by sitting activities to heart attack . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real prot@@ ector , saving back to life , even though they are not aware of it . &quot;
&quot; drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want it to be lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is of course not running every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled for the first time about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just the &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships . &quot;
people place a part of themselves openly and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is fast food compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but for it less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would , however , if trips would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you were visiting , a group there was announ@@ cer looking forward to complete a thoroughly and one at a pub pent@@ ine district , of which one has never heard of . &quot;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed based on privacy principle . &quot;
what if we would like to create apartments from the ground on the toge@@ ther@@ ness ?
how would that look like ?
what would be if cities would share the thoughts of the common part ?
&quot; I present cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of sol@@ itude and sealing . &quot;
&quot; in Southern Cor@@ kor@@ as capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parking spaces , which belonged to the government . &quot;
&quot; now guests were offered . students who were looking for a pen@@ be , &quot;
&quot; were given to people whose children were educated . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator programs , &quot;
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone the night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stran@@ ger or even host .
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were other similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we find that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound prejudi@@ ces .
I find the amazing !
almost overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about it every time , if a red Maz@@ da goes along . &quot;
we of course know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we could soon use design . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist work ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the back@@ at to the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims have negative .
studies show : the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
a Mö@@ ller @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ted me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and in opposite the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and in@@ capable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , figured in question , un@@ question@@ able , and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
&quot; I realize myself in it . I feel that God knows me . &quot;
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I was later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had at the end of my breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; express &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when he was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ lash out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock changed quickly in ou@@ trage .
why should we do something ?
&quot; I moved the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me from a civil war into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
in the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the study program .
&quot; I remember , as we ro@@ asted -- as we ro@@ asted -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time that Muslims was detected . &quot;
&quot; we moved on this night into our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully &quot; , &quot; &quot; star@@ ving in well @-@ lighted regions , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who held living for Muslims . &quot;
there was really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I thre@@ w the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly declare yourself .
&quot; I have nothing about questions , I love questions . &quot;
&quot; these are the accus@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we rid them ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and march .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a vi@@ cious tumor to be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our one is only under observation .
the alternatives are useless because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there will perhaps be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other belief , toler@@ ant and larger civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as me became head of the police in the Washington region of Washington , DC recently told , people will not be radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
you will be radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radi@@ alization process it is determined to cut online . as a first one can cut down the person from their church , even from their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ises their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or from faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS is founded its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as mother , as mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves into their imagination , if you acknowledge them as Repres@@ ent@@ atives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u club club with Christianity .
&quot; both groups claim their ideology , on their &quot; Holy Book &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it does not drive what they are called in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me a remarkable story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she would have imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with a radical religious leader .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence , and said her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , she would only bring in trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given its anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to their solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam turned the connection to God and her church again .
&quot; instead of preventing it for their anger , he showed its constructive paths to a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , keep it before the IS . &quot;
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affects our democracy each day on our way of thinking ?
one study - actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- when we fear that happen at least three things .
&quot; we are more accepting an author@@ itarian system , Conformity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : when selecting testing messages in which negative about Muslims was reported , they voted sooner military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims and upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run of Iraq war and during two periods of election .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the deal with Muslims is an early warning @-@ war@@ nings .
&quot; we may sense it as the first , but the toxic air of fear mel@@ es us all . &quot;
&quot; for the assignment of collective reasons , it is not just about to explain itself to himself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous man , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her to her life . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is out of my br@@ otherhood , such a versi@@ bly young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , killed , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , raid , which was on the afternoon to visit . he did it in their apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed at home for sure ?
&quot; we captiv@@ ate it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we left to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the nursery , we went to the mosque , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes came out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement that gave himself and his guests were welcome , because half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come to teach us . &quot;
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you keep on number safe ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than the ones .
many thanks .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say , which may be claiming to hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , working a thought with dr@@ au@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I am totally normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
&quot; when you look at Muslims across the world , and I did so with the greatest ever accomplished study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family ; they want work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , I do not have an exception in any respect . &quot;
&quot; if people seem to appear as an exception , then usually the rule was broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for Bast@@ ards , is about to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . &quot;
&quot; before air condi@@ tioner in our social consciousness , has an autonomous fleet of air machinery at the Fra@@ c Centre in France . some years ago has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago it began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by inter@@ locking flying , high speed and acceleration in the narro@@ west room . &quot;
you can also build their self @-@ duty structures .
&quot; they have learned to deal loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to nature laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the boundaries of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; to ensure a system autonomous , it must be collective aware where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a abl@@ ation of our lab@@ s . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board , what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external orders are available at the highest E@@ ben@@ e. e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called h@@ eck@@ starter .
&quot; a plane , which seeks to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ ig@@ gler , it is efficient , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the starter gl@@ ers it can fluctu@@ ate , and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of tail@@ ing is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il as wind @-@ bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft , no matter what position can be restored , and the performance can be improved by practicing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions , which inv@@ ade at the heart of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the small number of mo@@ ve@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for knowing the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known about as machines with a thousand movements that will work together to hurt you .
several decades ago trained pil@@ ots could fly remote @-@ controlled air devices that only had two mo@@ ve@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ opo@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ ank , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ator or contro@@ l@@ lo@@ id , is only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simple , happens in the inner life very much , so it can fly stable and move in space above . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the h@@ ew@@ one . to bring it to the F@@ lies , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it exactly when I see , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ ess , this machine is here , the omni@@ pot@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
&quot; therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment . &quot;
&quot; thus he receives the proper capability , &quot;
moving in space in all directions regardless of what direction he is rot@@ ated or even how he rotating .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of inter@@ active rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is un@@ think@@ able in models , the rest will be learning directly from the bow . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller air engines .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we are going to do a half .
the last demonstration is examined synthetic particles .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we participated negoti@@ ators Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and stat@@ utes them with loc@@ alized technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the specially secure machine for dr@@ ush wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the reward lies in the development and of the creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it is creative , clever creatures allowing them to form in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billions years ago in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes are getting faster , you turned into pure energy in a tenth party . &quot;
this short moment they illuminated they bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but your energy won &apos;t put it free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed down into the space @-@ time plum@@ age and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; in this case , we first arrange the events in the meantime . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago was the most important life on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , men and -- God stood at us with -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gravity black holes . &quot;
most of them stopped for crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser @-@ interval measurement - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO was significantly increased , which improved the efficiency performance enormously . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one calls him advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO has started out for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the Det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two coloni@@ zed black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my to@@ d@@ ill father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that which I had worked is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist , consisting of black holes and their by observ@@ atory such as LI@@ GO measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a mush@@ room in the ge@@ d@@ dle of space and time .
&quot; during temporary the wave , the space and its entire content into a direction are stretched and into the other star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lectur@@ ers in courses for the rel@@ ativity of theory often lead to a correct dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , everyone was stretched out of us at the advent of waves and stum@@ bled . the stretch of an average person was 10 high @-@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um explained the LI@@ GO employee for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a 1000@@ th of the radius of a nuclear weapons . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about engra@@ ving
&quot; description K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are er@@ fin@@ der@@ ous and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LI@@ GO . Scott maintains that LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial pul@@ ses , the size of your hand . &quot;
this is quite handy . for this way you can use an image or card of things by taking advantage of several points coming up .
for tones is the different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very hard to make a picture of things that make you very much mean : &quot;
about the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as sound system and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ently Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can with them no simple pictures of objects in all @-@ finished .
&quot; but by considering changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can hear their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert shaft , we can speak the universe literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity for listen , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been very busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ twi@@ sting holes , circul@@ ates simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you listen to the same p@@ ples with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
it is a sort of movement that is shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget - heard LI@@ GO follow : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al noise &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with thirty @-@ fold solar mass , which are about as fast as the sticks of your bl@@ ender . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the di@@ cht@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns that others with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times per second , before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
make these forces present .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls , as they never before was possible . &quot;
this is the way we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not seeing .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ h@@ ks stars in super @-@ nov@@ as explo@@ ding . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the All .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes occur however in the nucl@@ eus , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon , and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through because this op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it were to explore more transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ale : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Ur@@ scar@@ let covers his own glow . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to return to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; most importantly : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found the same in the first song that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this subject : ME : the type of stars , which shows black holes , such as LI@@ GO they are observed are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO offers us a completely different angle on the events in all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cl@@ ement of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Observ@@ atory -- a very new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful , than to listen to the judgment ? &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say to &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before that I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , bringing me into unpleasant situations , I am forced me to say yes . &quot;
did I speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to start playing with the spectacle ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just what happened , I feared , denied my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; cookies , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my beak @-@ asse . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; of a new attitude in my family . from there I float ever to play with them as soon as you call me on . no matter what I am doing , or wherever I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I am not perfect but I am distr@@ acted .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a stunning side @-@ effect : just recently , I was fully understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things down to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I re@@ produced television .
I have television , in large style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each program offers hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days in four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four broad@@ casts , 70 hours TV , three episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my tel@@ ev@@ isions are running out on Thursday nights .
around the world I run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments I created themselves , and not only produces , so still ob@@ end@@ ous . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , who burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still making ?
&quot; no one , therefore am I a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I do not want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I tell you all of you who work so hard if you are now a company , a country or a household , take a shop or a household , so you realize that I don &apos;t just talk on the computer and f@@ antasi@@ es , and it is true when I say , I understand that it is not a dream job to dream of dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work hard , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my job always creates a land from nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I put troops on , when I was on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so , there is a high tone , ran a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and mat@@ ern@@ al , cruel and sensible . and the best thing is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could always go on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take , when I declare to them the sums I say , that I was getting excited about it . &quot;
do not understand me wrong with doing it .
&quot; but the bu@@ zz -- when I began to work with television production , when I began to work and work , to build and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the sums is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you can not strive differently from size .
&quot; the feeling that cannot be different , than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not made for failure and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz .
&quot; I will only tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it in question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I &apos;ll , the more transmis@@ sions , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more things I know , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , that I created , the marathon , the army , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the sums .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then stopped the sums .
&quot; revised , over@@ taken , exagger@@ ated , spread . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working titles . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says , &quot; Pil@@ ates , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were heard . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine si@@ ze@@ able .
I no longer loved my job . the engine was off .
the bu@@ ffer did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , carried out weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , a tit@@ anium not , is not on , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ report @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , stupid the author @-@ tit@@ anium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are doing what you are doing is a ban@@ ker , one mother to be a painter , one mother , you just likes one another and that is one of the sums you feel when the sums stopped when the bu@@ zz stops , who is then one ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in the still@@ ness ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; constitutes a question .
&quot; I am on the way out there , late it and says : &quot; mom , lean you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will be no saying , as I am aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; sheep . &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; cookies . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz , and here all changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; mom , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing extraordinary .
&quot; we play and meet her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and absence of the sum , I can do nothing except . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , that I created , the marathon , the marathon , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , watch@@ dog and the song in which it is getting to let go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me can solve .
a mental door goes down and a energy shift comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
not the tot@@ als but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the bu@@ zz , the work sum@@ ming , the fix@@ tures , which is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
the real sums is dependent on love .
&quot; the bu@@ zz is the electricity , which comes from the lust for life . &quot;
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums were ignored the pressure of history , the overall tasks , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; true sums of God is the voice of God in my ear , but maybe whis@@ per@@ ed me God the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child want to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I &apos;m doing this to the firm rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of all guilt .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice , unless I want to hear the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I like it . &quot;
&quot; playing with me is not to be ans@@ at@@ eb@@ se , as we work . &quot;
&quot; the truth is hur@@ ting , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I am always working because I love it .
I prefer a place at the workplace as a home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a human being is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ ens around the garden , before and back , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance @-@ parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we are sh@@ out soap @-@ bub@@ bles .
&quot; thereby , I feel more rigi@@ d , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe ful@@ fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we have stopped playing with the games ?
you can also say it ! they always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams . &quot;
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child can be less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my children do not want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes , until they catch up with them , that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes there is a Marien@@ k@@ äfer or K@@ eks .
&quot; and speak my teen @-@ daughter full 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more requires not . &quot;
anyone can bring about 15 minutes in the piece by yourself to a bad mood day !
15 minutes at the foot !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my dear , my world . we do not have to be the children . it is true to have the bu@@ zz to have a place for his soul fri@@ eden . &quot;
it is not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ;
to play &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I wins . friends meet who read books that enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; just for everything I have given up , when I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes at the foot why not indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens onto the energy and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . she cle@@ ave me to new ideas . I use it in full moves and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz of the bu@@ zz I am not anymore ... no more .
&quot; soap @-@ bub@@ bles , and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sums .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so thankful . &quot;
&quot; it is se@@ atic , that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is even functional . my camp@@ fire burn .
&quot; the more I play , the more fortunate I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I created this marathon , the fl@@ ax , the fl@@ ax@@ ing , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of the bu@@ zz : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel the bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , care@@ ers , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things I awake in to life .
&quot; that belongs to the job , that means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and to more play .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical surgery .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to another , after a serious stroke or an accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was surgical surgical surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; certainly they have heard from one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ ding stimulation &quot; . &quot; in this way , one impl@@ anted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the adjustment of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function has been improved . &quot;
it truly is an astonishing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son who suffered severe tre@@ m@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ modul@@ ation however means not Ne@@ uro @-@ Healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior leader and worked a day and night in the emergency .
I have operated patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ deer @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a must rise the brain and the sk@@ ull pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ished the sk@@ ull @-@ pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , one must sometimes remove a part of damaged brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the bra@@ in@@ ous brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , an bi@@ ologist , the brain . &quot;
what will I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; let the cells grow from a tissue , is comparable to very small children , which can be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve it . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many associations , Jean @-@ François . &quot;
this was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the bi@@ ology lessons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells can turn into each cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nav@@ y of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal tri@@ bal cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mor@@ tal .
but these cells hold differently .
they were slowly distributed and after a couple of weeks she even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell@@ population which looked like stem cells , but changed differently . &quot;
&quot; we needed long , to understand where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you can make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ n@@ rin@@ den@@ cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of fet@@ us they ensure the bra@@ ins of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentr@@ ations near brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source of brain @-@ healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to see a piece of brain &apos;s clay in the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells just as civil@@ ised as Jean @-@ François did
and they are then colored to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we anticip@@ ate them to the acceptance of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transpl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions were : what happens when we kill these cells in normal brain tissue tissue ? and what will happen if we kill the same cells in damaged brain tissue tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared after a few weeks , they were returned again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we have a violation of and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they have grown to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have mature .
&quot; evidence that they show , these small points are . these are the cells that we colored in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
are these cells also help to recover from a brain l@@ esion ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ istic function .
you had to take feed pell@@ ets from a tablet .
they made them very good .
when they had achieved a stable skill level we had in motor@@ ic cor@@ tex the hand@@ mot@@ ot@@ or branch .
&quot; as a result the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , it recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plas@@ tic brain mechanics and recover at some degree , just as in the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , which recovered spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from violation .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , as we see the cells rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ine : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them with the people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kil@@ ograms papers and forms in order to go through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : have a look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to look for the launch of clinical trials . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years it takes to come into hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to launch the authority soon ?
then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it has been necessary for a long time to select the patient , perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before one can offer this treatment any more .
BG : and that it is certain of course . J@@ B : natural .
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which it is in reality , but as invent@@ ories of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing opponents .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great f@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains entirely non @-@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the newly elected Greek government -- made un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence austerity , which were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my up@@ set friends who would say to me if democracy would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe in along with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies become dark , our future glo@@ omy , and our great , new technologies w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; to the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; tw@@ ist summit @-@ par@@ adox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the deb@@ tors , &quot;
but few recognize his Twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the se@@ ven@@ ing sa@@ vers and corporations who would be productive there , where it would be productive and would bring about all the things that is urgently needed for humanity , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call you two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the U.S. , in England and the Eurozone , 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ onen had invested US dollars , such as industrial installations , machinery , offices , schools , roads , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ onen US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compar@@ es with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion in U.S. dollars , which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; this is how debt and un@@ productive capital constitute the tw@@ ist summit , which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe @-@ free , and consequently a low pan @-@ economic demand that could not invest in an end@@ los@@ ure the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would not invest a low demand in which they would not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus Father , which would be true that his son would kill him when he grows , &quot;
&quot; un@@ solic@@ ited the circumstances fall , which lead to it that O@@ di@@ pus is k@@ ills it . &quot;
this is my ha@@ iry of capitalism --
&quot; its exc@@ eed@@ ingly w@@ der@@ ous Art All the un@@ productive capital should be deployed to improve our lives , developing human talents , and especially all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form in which the Free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed naturally too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to under@@ min@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these degrees . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they gave them the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important , and more crucial that they can give them the right to political co@@ determination with the same mood in questions of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which is very lumin@@ ous , it is also rapidly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ liberal democr@@ acies have not seen their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy strengthened on the free citizens and the working poor is strengthened , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process to policy , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , while the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics and dec@@ ayed them . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer like it was in the past ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because it can be in the government and still not in power because the power from politics to the economy is torn apart and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ ils with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , that so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that conver@@ ged politics as far as the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods become ab@@ norm@@ alities , the economic demand falls and the management of corporations are fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of its companies . &quot;
&quot; the successful of capitalism continues the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the cem@@ ented summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control itself , just as in the antique Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
the teaching from the Deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only restore a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to create the working arms !
capitalism does it by adding low @-@ glo@@ omy through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , such as long economy and politics are separate areas , automation can be higher the wast@@ age , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we must therefore re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and ensure that we can be re@@ united in an illness monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that leaves the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the question is not if capitalism has brought up the technical achievements that he has brought forth , -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved through a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines will serve people and people to study their energy into the study of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what we smo@@ ked it , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar c@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples in the practical implementation . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money , while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital come from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there but no big gaps between investment and Sp@@ ars , and ultimately not an em@@ bodi@@ ment summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ate exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 biggest emerging markets &#93; . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade should be acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merch@@ ant of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , where investment means are . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
&quot; the problem was , that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it . &quot;
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ated people , in which they privileged persons , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the sleeve of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ anian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; - similar c@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ? &quot;
the answer depends on how we can decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography himself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have said just was relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... do not do that , technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
&quot; due to the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing , it will not only be destabil@@ ised by our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; when this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; on the same way , Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ular Marxist , and such as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely s@@ wir@@ l . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r do not think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the supp@@ er of the speakers , you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy on policy , while the area where most of the economy is playing -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say pro@@ voc@@ ative , it resem@@ bles that today in the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical as to the democratic development .
&quot; what you can watch in China now , similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now it is to blame that what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I know that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , of the su@@ ic@@ ency to the f@@ arewell , and the di@@ spar@@ king denial means that a massive slo@@ wing line ran through the eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely threat the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first suggestion was that the denial made of denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , are continuing to denial the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one is trying to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it will perhaps be able to delay a while , but if the changes occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Th@@ sth@@ aft ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he did not make mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the training programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors , finding a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the en@@ dow@@ ments carried out by the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to conf@@ ess that they have led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
that is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika credi@@ tors which has imposed us this policy , and one : &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone is coming from someone who lives and loves . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; for if it is not survived , the free flow forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we have sh@@ ado@@ wing ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it will be as durable for the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you &apos;re mist@@ aken at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price most still never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is assistant at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production facility of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an i@@ ri@@ cher and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it , the shows and the content utter@@ ing to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are right on this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 , and the height shows how many shows this review received . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; breaking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , that is addi@@ c@@ ted where , after having looked a season , your brain asks , &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about the left side of the curve , because I think you already needs special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it makes up more thoughts about the medium term , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , therefore Roy doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he will hold a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he will produce the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is out of vain things , you can &apos;t walk properly ? &quot;
millions of viewers have a look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed at the look of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; capture , when you start the show when you get pau@@ per , which parts you are ski@@ ps or looking again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with this data to produce which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they gather the data , process it and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com by four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House , at 7.5 -- is something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these small details about the spect@@ ators : which shows them like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they had a wagon , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a transm@@ itter . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,@@ 1 review on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; we have two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow domin@@ ates that it should work with all .
&quot; if you coll@@ ects millions of data for a decision that one meets , then you should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized for very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so then this is something sc@@ ary , because we are living in a time in which we take more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond TV . &quot;
does anyone know the company multi @-@ health system ?
&quot; no . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just as at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , if a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always created the best results , which is not always aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
even the data of sealed companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes does mistake . &quot;
&quot; 2009 Google announced that they can say through data analysis breaks of flu , the lim@@ men way , fores@@ try -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success gi@@ fted into a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked properly , year after year , until it suddenly did not work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply wasn &apos;t working , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer treatment &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I realized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; to solve a complex problem , you do mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first copy of this problem into its parts , so you can analyse the individual components ; as a second place you put the parts back together to summar@@ ize a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and set up again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to achieve the parts once again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that the brain is good at which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces back together even if the information is incomplete in order to summar@@ ize a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x successful , because they have used data and mind , where they also go in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else would not have been able to do . but the decision how to put all these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they had worked for TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they say the data .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better choices , but I think things went wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to not forget this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the instrument for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ issue you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;
I will then fold it later with a demo demo .
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something much of it , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; so perhaps the ball wis@@ er and wis@@ er , and wis@@ er . ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news , that despite the large amount of data still pays off decisions to be an expert in what you are doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the dates but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you beautiful .
