<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New-York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA are illegally intercepted by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is but another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein he described a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA is literally covered for an atomic bomb for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, you can read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, whom this chapter was not gone?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government called against Risen and asked him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers and to study journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones, which they can be reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came to Risen, he did something, what many brave reporters did before him: he refused, and said he would rather go to the prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, happened slightly extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though she had for years of claims that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing to fail and isen with claims, that could also carry out its digital footprints."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and in this way the investigators, without its consent, express their phone numbers,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his loans, and even friction with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblowers and cracks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect his lawyer, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all the U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too secret from their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since 11 September, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistle-blowers to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we thus set the press work in the game that should be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more possibilities to spy all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they can get that from the moment in which they contact, instead of entering into witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that hasn't been written as Risen his book was written, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmitter system for whistle-blowers, which was originally developed by the internet famous Aaron Swartz, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I am working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can download documents, or send information to your usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"this will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only the relevant news agency."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer provide information secretly, and many of the information they claim would not be available."</seg>
<seg id="36">"but SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new spy technologies that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to ensure that not only technology-denominator such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to evideness offenders. it is just as important that we can protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the over abnormalities when supplying to soldiers from modest, and crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for sighing water of Flint defeats. or a Wallstreet insider that warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3. April 2016 the largest datleck of the story published.] [the" "Panama Papers" "was hiding as the" "Panama Papers" "was hidden.] [what does it mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Witness to be a statement.] this week we were sent by messages about a latch of 11 million documents of the law firms in Panama based law firm."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up the setup? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad briefing companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it claims that a track record from 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads, through a close friend of infants, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous the next release, and the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency or an John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this lead us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, this unveils are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens are used by a few minutes to hide their assets and wear -- something that we have been discussing and enthused for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think, many people will see this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because it has hitherto no prominent American issued in these revelations, this scandal. "</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not so that there are no enough Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"could we have had a collection of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have a lot more cases and examples that have links to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to create a company than to obtain a librarian credit card."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this type of intransparence in the US has allowed the employees of schoolbores, to cut school children."</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has frauds allow, especially to cut off investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here with Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an uncovered entry into the offices of 13 criminal companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave itself as African minister, the suspected money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked, that all will be made up to an attorney at our investigator's proposals, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all pre-preaches. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anyone was handed over to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has been subject to our uncovered proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leader, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this might sound very smoothly sound, as if we could do anything against it: as if nothing had ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as well-born Optimist I really see that some changes have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen precautions to greater transparency where the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then the EU has been gathered in central registrants at the national level, who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"the representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind the headcount."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say:" Intransparency is not good for business. ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and end it, by laws to end this type of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finish the intransparence that now allow this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finish."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Macedonists."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my designer, I made a back-home."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red maaMazda have been standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "where do you work for today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I do not know yet. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a bedroom on a bedroom?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I did not know him just yet! he says he would go to the peace of grain, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Macedland!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard that: "I have a lilo. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "h, how do I pray?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and thought:" Oh dear. what did I feel like in me? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild estrangement in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of bed, on tenth pointed to the door, and my sleeping door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people were sold to me as a stranger, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air conditioning, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a long leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plaster, my roommate attracts off and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference at that time. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow occupant Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have translated as we can earn something to do. our apartment will stay for a designer bed and breakfast. young designers are able to stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "airmattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happier guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollar on the bubble ground on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They thought it was great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese-ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we were touring with them throughout the city. as we had passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, starred Brian and I went to."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate-inhabitants, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors:" we want to create a site, on the people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, whose doors you are closing when visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can invite people to spend the wild people with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still consolation for consolation, would invest in a business, strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one gets on the things that you can do well. we were able to fend."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to take objects up, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, among people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">To make design such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a cost of tasting what degree we have done.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unerrated cell phone sharing your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet filling of panic that you now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing that is still more personal than your mobile phone, your home is."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You also feel the most guests when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just sometimes who has actually Al Gores Handy?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he urged for the office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobiles now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour could be introduced only once with his name; if he told, whence he does come as his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that would say: "he can really see very well prooted mobiles!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the confidence key.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to prevent adverse assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed down their assignment, before we asked them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprise we trust the people most who are most pleasing us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting is it if you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments that nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation-suffoctions from.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you are cheaper."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you feel too little, as for example" Hi!, "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you can tell a lot, such as:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "Tolle works of your apartment!" "I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to establish this degree in openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the great crowd of people who were more than willing to submit these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">See how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the indefatigable work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been unallowed partys and have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">I worked on my phone at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it is hurting if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the anus, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, by the 123 million mid-sized nights only a fraction ever had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other to justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, it can be awesome."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, which tend to be contracted by sitting activities to heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protector, saving back to life, even though they are not aware of it."</seg>
<seg id="218">"drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want it to be lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is of course not running every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled for the first time about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just the" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships."</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves openly and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is fast food compared to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but for it less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would, however, if trips would be a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you were visiting, a group there was announcer looking forward to complete a thoroughly and one at a pub pentine district, of which one has never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed based on privacy principle."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from the ground on the togetherness?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would share the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I present cities that allow us to society and relationships instead of solitude and sealing."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in Southern Corkoras capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parking spaces, which belonged to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"now guests were offered. students who were looking for a penbe,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were given to people whose children were educated. there were incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone the night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were other similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we find that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the amazing!</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I have to think about it every time, if a red Mazda goes along."</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we could soon use design."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brainwashing, a terrorist work?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the backat to the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims have negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möller-Fitness-Fanatikerin, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, Baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outed me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in opposite the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and incapable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, figured in question, unquestionable, and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">"I realize myself in it. I feel that God knows me."</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I was later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had at the end of my breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" express "." "</seg>
<seg id="293">"when he was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people splash out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock changed quickly in outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me from a civil war into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">In the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new town and begin with the study program.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we roasted -- as we roasted -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time that Muslims was detected."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved on this night into our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Seid carefully "," "starving in well-lighted regions," "Versammmelt you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who held living for Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I threw the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly declare yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing about questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">"these are the accusations, which are hard."</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we rid them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and march.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a vicious tumor to be removed as a whole and a benign tumour one is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are useless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympioniken."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there will perhaps be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other belief, tolerant and larger civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as me became head of the police in the Washington region of Washington, DC recently told, people will not be radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radialization process it is determined to cut online. as a first one can cut down the person from their church, even from their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who despises their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or from faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS is founded its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as mother, as mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves into their imagination, if you acknowledge them as Representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku club club with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"both groups claim their ideology, on their" Holy Book "." "</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it does not drive what they are called in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me a remarkable story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she would have imagined to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with a radical religious leader.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence, and said her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, she would only bring in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given its anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke to their solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of preventing it for their anger, he showed its constructive paths to a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, keep it before the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affects our democracy each day on our way of thinking?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study - actually show several neuroscientific studies -- when we fear that happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are more accepting an authoritarian system, Conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: when selecting testing messages in which negative about Muslims was reported, they voted sooner military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims and upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of Iraq war and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The deal with Muslims is an early warning-warnings.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may sense it as the first, but the toxic air of fear meles us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"for the assignment of collective reasons, it is not just about to explain itself to himself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was on the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweet, generous man, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her to her life. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is out of my brotherhood, such a versibly young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed, just like the sister of Yusor, raid, which was on the afternoon to visit. he did it in their apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He spent eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed at home for sure?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we captivate it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we left to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the nursery, we went to the mosque, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes came out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement that gave himself and his guests were welcome, because half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who had come to teach us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you choosing at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you keep on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those that mean: we are better than the ones.</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build their self-duty structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to deal loads, deal with turmoil and generally respond to nature laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the boundaries of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"to ensure a system autonomous, it must be collective aware where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a ablation of our labs."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board, what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external orders are available at the highest Ebene. e.g." "start" "and" land "." "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a plane, which seeks to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Stariggler, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starter glers it can fluctuate, and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tailing is that they are sensitive to turmoil as wind-bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the aircraft, no matter what position can be restored, and the performance can be improved by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions, which invade at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the small number of moveable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for knowing the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movements that will work together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago trained pilots could fly remote-controlled air devices that only had two moveable parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monopoinner, the mechanically simplest aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flank, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuator or controlloid, is only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simple, happens in the inner life very much, so it can fly stable and move in space above."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hewone. to bring it to the Flies, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly when I see, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in geness, this machine is here, the omnipotter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment."</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus he receives the proper capability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions regardless of what direction he is rotated or even how he rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is unthinkable in models, the rest will be learning directly from the bow."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller air engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they act like a high-performance quadrucopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we are going to do a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is examined synthetic particles.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated negotiators Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and statutes them with localized technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The specially secure machine for drush wants to become a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward lies in the development and of the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative, clever creatures allowing them to form in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, men and -- God stood at us with -- even the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-interval measurement - gravitational-waves-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following time, the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, which improved the efficiency performance enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, one calls him advanced LIGO."</seg>

<seg id="492">"all that which I had worked is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist, consisting of black holes and their by observatory such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a mushroom in the geddle of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"during temporary the wave, the space and its entire content into a direction are stretched and into the other starches."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses for the relativity of theory often lead to a correct dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusting, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, everyone was stretched out of us at the advent of waves and stumbled. the stretch of an average person was 10 high-21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum explained the LIGO employee for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometres long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a 1000th of the radius of a nuclear weapons. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about engraving</seg>
<seg id="502">"description KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunt for the waves as follows:" "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are enormous."</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are erfinderous and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial pulses, the size of your hand."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for this way you can use an image or card of things by taking advantage of several points coming up.</seg>
<seg id="509">For tones is the different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very hard to make a picture of things that make you very much mean:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as sound system and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"silently Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can with them no simple pictures of objects in all-finished.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can hear their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert shaft, we can speak the universe literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity for listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been very busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-twisting holes, circulates simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very fast, you listen to the same pples with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement that is shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I never forget - heard LIGO follow: [Surrenal noise] Jemand, who knows what he has to hear, recognize this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with thirty-fold solar mass, which are about as fast as the sticks of your blender."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dichtest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns that others with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times per second, before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Make these forces present.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO paves a completely new way to explore the Alls, as they never before was possible."</seg>
<seg id="534">This is the way we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not seeing.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why mashks stars in super-novas exploding."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes occur however in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon, and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were to explore more transparent glass. the Urbale: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Urscarlet covers his own glow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to return to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"most importantly: I'm optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see, and of which we don't have any idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found the same in the first song that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this subject: ME: the type of stars, which shows black holes, such as LIGO they are observed are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO offers us a completely different angle on the events in all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circlement of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatory -- a very new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be more beautiful, than to listen to the judgment?"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the spectacle?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: just what happened, I feared, denied my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to keep my social fear -- Puff, weg."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life to an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all" cookies, "</seg>

<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her, when I was just on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"of a new attitude in my family. from there I float ever to play with them as soon as you call me on. no matter what I am doing, or wherever I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect but I am distracted.</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a stunning side-effect: just recently, I was fully understood that the" "Yes" "to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things down to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I reproduced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I have television, in large style. "</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production. "</seg>
<seg id="588">"each program offers hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days in four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four broadcasts, 70 hours TV, three episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my televisions are running out on Thursday nights.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world I run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shipments I created themselves, and not only produces, so still obendous. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, who burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still making?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore am I a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" "author". ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you all of you who work so hard if you are now a company, a country or a household, take a shop or a household, so you realize that I don't just talk on the computer and fantasies, and it is true when I say, I understand that it is not a dream job to dream of dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work hard, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My job always creates a land from nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I put troops on, when I was on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so, there is a high tone, ran a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and maternal, cruel and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could always go on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take, when I declare to them the sums I say, that I was getting excited about it."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong with doing it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began to work with television production, when I began to work and work, to build and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you can not strive differently from size.</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling that cannot be different, than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not made for failure and I just know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it in question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I'll, the more transmissions, the more work there, the more things at the same time, the more things I know, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, that I created, the marathon, the army, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stopped the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overtaken, exaggerated, spread."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working titles."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says," Pilates, I want to go to Shonda country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine sizeable.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my job. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buffer did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same titans work, 15 hours-days, carried out weekends, no repentance, a titanium not, is not on, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-report-Titan, "</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "Heul you out, stupid the author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are doing what you are doing is a banker, one mother to be a painter, one mother, you just likes one another and that is one of the sums you feel when the sums stopped when the buzz stops, who is then one?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in the stillness?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" constitutes a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out there, late it and says:" mom, lean you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will be no saying, as I am aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" sheep. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "cookies."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz, and here all changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and meet her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and absence of the sum, I can do nothing except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, that I created, the marathon, the marathon, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, watchdog and the song in which it is getting to let go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me can solve.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes down and a energy shift comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the work summing, the fixtures, which is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the buzz is the electricity, which comes from the lust for life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums were ignored the pressure of history, the overall tasks, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums of God is the voice of God in my ear, but maybe whispered me God the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child want to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this to the firm rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic of all guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice, unless I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing with me is not to be ansatebse, as we work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurting,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer a place at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a human being is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>

<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fulfills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we have stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say yes, if your child wants to play with you. "</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naïve, for a daydreams."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can be less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my children do not want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes, until they catch up with them, that they want to make something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes there is a Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>

<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more requires not."</seg>
<seg id="752">Anyone can bring about 15 minutes in the piece by yourself to a bad mood day!</seg>

<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children finished."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my dear, my world. we do not have to be the children. it is true to have the buzz to have a place for his soul frieden."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it's about joy;</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I wins. friends meet who read books that enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" just for everything I have given up, when I got my first TV show, when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to meet myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the foot why not indulge in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my free time. the buzz seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens onto the energy and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. she cleave me to new ideas. I use it in full moves and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz of the buzz I am not anymore... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap-bubbles, and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>

<seg id="778">"it is seatic, that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is even functional. my campfire burn.</seg>

<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'yes' to less work and to more play.</seg>

<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical surgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to another, after a serious stroke or an accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was surgical surgical surgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard from one of the most well-known, the" "Tiefending stimulation". "in this way, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the adjustment of the neurons so that the neurological function has been improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an astonishing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however means not Neuro-Healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior leader and worked a day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I have operated patients with skulls-deer-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in Schädel-Hirn-Traumata must rise the brain and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminished the skull-pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one must sometimes remove a part of damaged brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the brainous brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, an biologist, the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What will I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"let the cells grow from a tissue, is comparable to very small children, which can be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive it."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many associations, Jean-François. "</seg>
<seg id="825">This was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biology lessons that stem cells unripe cells can turn into each cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small navy of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells hold differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly distributed and after a couple of weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cellpopulation which looked like stem cells, but changed differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long, to understand where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You can make 4% of our grandhirnrindencells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of fetus they ensure the brains of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source of brain-healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to see a piece of brain's clay in the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just as civilised as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then colored to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we anticipate them to the acceptance of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions were: what happens when we kill these cells in normal brain tissue tissue? and what will happen if we kill the same cells in damaged brain tissue tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared after a few weeks, they were returned again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we have a violation of and reimplated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they have grown to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have mature.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show, these small points are. these are the cells that we colored in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells also help to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexteristic function.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable skill level we had in motoric cortex the handmototor branch.</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, it recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanics and recover at some degree, just as in the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, which recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original power from violation.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, as we see the cells reimpline: the same monkey, two months after the irritation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them with the people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms papers and forms in order to go through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: have a look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to look for the launch of clinical trials. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years it takes to come into hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch the authority soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it has been necessary for a long time to select the patient, perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before one can offer this treatment any more.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as inventories of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging opponents.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great fahmer in Beijing have proven doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains entirely non-democratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the newly elected Greek government -- made unequivocally clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to influence austerity, which were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my upset friends who would say to me if democracy would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in along with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies become dark, our future gloomy, and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"to the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twist summit-paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debtors,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the sevening savers and corporations who would be productive there, where it would be productive and would bring about all the things that is urgently needed for humanity, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call you two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the U.S., in England and the Eurozone, 3,4 Billionen had invested US dollars, such as industrial installations, machinery, offices, schools, roads, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3,4 Billionen US dollars sounds a lot of money until one compares with the 5,1 trillion in U.S. dollars, which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"this is how debt and unproductive capital constitute the twist summit, which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe-free, and consequently a low pan-economic demand that could not invest in an endlosure the pessimism of investors that would not invest a low demand in which they would not invest. just like Oedipus Father, which would be true that his son would kill him when he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unsolicited the circumstances fall, which lead to it that Odipus is kills it."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hairy of capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its exceedingly wderous Art All the unproductive capital should be deployed to improve our lives, developing human talents, and especially all the technologies to finance," green "technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form in which the Free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to underminate the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these degrees."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that they gave them the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important, and more crucial that they can give them the right to political codetermination with the same mood in questions of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very luminous, it is also rapidly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-liberal democracies have not seen their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy strengthened on the free citizens and the working poor is strengthened, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process to policy, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, while the economy gradually migrated to politics and decayed them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer like it was in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it can be in the government and still not in power because the power from politics to the economy is torn apart and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hails with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, that so sustainably the animals, of which they nourished, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that converged politics as far as the economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods become abnormalities, the economic demand falls and the management of corporations are frightened to invest the cash of its companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the successful of capitalism continues the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the cemented summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the" Demos "control itself, just as in the antique Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the Debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only restore a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by adding low-gloomy through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, such as long economy and politics are separate areas, automation can be higher the wastage, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we must therefore reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and ensure that we can be reunited in an illness monitoring hyperautocracy that leaves the film" "matrix" "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"therefore, the question is not if capitalism has brought up the technical achievements that he has brought forth, --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved through a Dystopie, similar to the" "Star Trek", "in which machines will serve people and people to study their energy into the study of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora "," in long talks the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what we smoked it, how could it look like this" star Trek "-like utopia instead of" "matrix" "similar cystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples in the practical implementation."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money, while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a working place to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital come from capital and redeeming the concept of wage work is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there but no big gaps between investment and Spars, and ultimately not an embodiment summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuate exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 biggest emerging markets]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade should be acted in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos "," in units of "cosmos" -- and any government pays the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of the country, into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, where investment means are."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">"the problem was, that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it."</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is at the same time liberated people, in which they privileged persons, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the sleeve of history, and keynesian, globally keynesianian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "" matrix "" - similar cystopie? "</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography himself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have said just was relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... do not do that, technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as a" long-term stagnation. "</seg>
<seg id="984">"due to the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing, it will not only be destabilised by our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"when this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"on the same way, Hayek, therefore I am a libertular Marxist, and such as Keynes, and therefore I am also completely swirl."</seg>

<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the supper of the speakers, you said very clearly what you think of the West's point of view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy on policy, while the area where most of the economy is playing -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say provocative, it resembles that today in the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically. "</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical as to the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can watch in China now, similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now it is to blame that what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I know that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone."</seg>

<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first suggestion was that the denial made of denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, are continuing to denial the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one is trying to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, it will perhaps be able to delay a while, but if the changes occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you look ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Thsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make mistakes, then that is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the training programme at the end of February.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most still never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on 19th April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is assistant at Amazon Studios, "</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production facility of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an iricher and describes on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it, the shows and the content uttering to produce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10, and the height shows how many shows this review received."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" breaking bath, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, that is addicted where, after having looked a season, your brain asks," where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't care about the left side of the curve, because I think you already needs special intelligence to offer" "toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"it makes up more thoughts about the medium term, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, therefore Roy doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he will hold a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he will produce the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can watch everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is out of vain things, you can't walk properly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed at the look of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"capture, when you start the show when you get pauper, which parts you are skips or looking again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with this data to produce which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they gather the data, process it and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom by four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House, at 7.5 -- is something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team have looked at the available data about the Netflix audience, i.e. the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these small details about the spectators: which shows them like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they had a wagon, and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "receives a 9,1 review on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"we have two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow dominates that it should work with all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collects millions of data for a decision that one meets, then you should be able to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized for very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so then this is something scary, because we are living in a time in which we take more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond TV."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just as at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, if a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always created the best results, which is not always aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of sealed companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes does mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009 Google announced that they can say through data analysis breaks of flu, the limmen way, forestry -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success gifted into a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked properly, year after year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply wasn't working, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer treatment"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I realized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"to solve a complex problem, you do mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first copy of this problem into its parts, so you can analyse the individual components; as a second place you put the parts back together to summarize a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and set up again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to achieve the parts once again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that the brain is good at which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces back together even if the information is incomplete in order to summarize a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore I think I was Netflix successful, because they have used data and mind, where they also go in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else would not have been able to do. but the decision how to put all these parts again, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," which was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they had worked for TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they say the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better choices, but I think things went wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to not forget this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the instrument for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-issue you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- exactly here in this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will then fold it later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something much of it, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball wiser and wiser, and wiser. ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news, that despite the large amount of data still pays off decisions to be an expert in what you are doing, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the dates but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
