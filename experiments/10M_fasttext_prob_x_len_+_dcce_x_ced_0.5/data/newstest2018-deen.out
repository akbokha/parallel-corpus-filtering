Munich 1856 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet . &quot;
a pit @-@ chapel where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ är@@ tner cultiv@@ ate the in@@ dent reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mun@@ ies supports exciting stories about days .
there is nerv@@ ously when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone , who had to rain himself already , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State government , are anything but current - but that is why it is very inspiring . &quot;
especially when they compare them with current online cards .
&quot; then it becomes apparent how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a spl@@ attered canvas , which one does not recognize as such . &quot;
&quot; in the great postcard we have worked for cities and villages for detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional blades . &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the Bav@@ arian surv@@ ey@@ ed administration , between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and dispos@@ ed of the first survey of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders had been occupied with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if French troops served with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a surface @-@ covered Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph brought the project forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bav@@ arian corruption management . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others found on the website of the Bav@@ arian state library .
the comparison of fruits / Today is at the example of the state capital of the former capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was used 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings focus at 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was only named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : while Hin@@ du o@@ oms appears a small piece of map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written pla@@ ques from the so called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ up@@ take &quot; &quot; which was derived from the property tax . &quot;
small plots do not occupy the world today no farmers - but small @-@ är@@ tner of the plant &quot; land in the sun .
a large green space is characterised by the north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 exhibits of the October 19th century , was actually a meadow - and no concrete form in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map provides an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the district of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only read the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the ventil@@ ation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , you once get people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; at the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , brought to the death of King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended for example the Ank@@ ets of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he is also permitted to use the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had first place first , later on 500 seats were extended . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ ks in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar Am@@ ber @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ t is located in Munich since 2006 , one of the largest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ ates of Germany . &quot;
on the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt can now meet young people in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order was built in 1920 building in 1920 and turned him in a youth @-@ home with educational establishments .
&quot; west is the football ground of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings in the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , one set up the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in ar@@ quit@@ ecture to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was at 1856 as a &quot; main place , &quot; the department called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change carried out even in the heart of the Second World War .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city centre .
a big stayed up to the present day - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business houses and a pit @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages once stood by the Marien@@ hof , where this day was the pre @-@ operation and on 5 April 2017 , for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the a@@ erial photograph of today - and the hole in the Marien@@ hof fill . &quot;
civil rights group released Reise@@ warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national union to promote colored groups has issued a warning for colored people who travel on the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the State to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which aims to come into force until 28 August 2017 , call for af@@ ro American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of ques@@ tioning , check@@ out inci@@ dents in recent times throughout the state and here be re@@ marked , &quot; it says in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it he@@ avier to gain discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ ution bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have bre@@ aches of citizens &apos; rights to happen people .
&quot; they are raised because of their skin colour , they are mer@@ ged or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such an frequency which we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist associations against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after while travelling by the state was no gas@@ oline , and was taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Office Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be more common than women . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be prepared if they bring money @-@ money or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ ges in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ ver@@ bre@@ w reporting program of F@@ BI , which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the itinerary is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ Law , which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ ES ) Dest@@ inations for Texas and Arizona , published after the States immigration authorities , committed to viol@@ ate local prosec@@ ution bodies , as regards opinion of the AC@@ ES to further R@@ acial pro@@ clam@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; travelling openings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but at the last time , stakeholders have implemented the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
en@@ visi@@ bly project is elementary
the Fisher@@ men Wei@@ res@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ agli@@ der Peter Weiss and Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac have given himself a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the Pi@@ ot@@ mann family , representatives of the her@@ edit@@ ary CD@@ U locals met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann gave initially insights into his business , in which he hosts 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest crops , 40 milk kitchen and as many kitt@@ ens provided and housed in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the altern@@ ate mark@@ eter mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Ferien@@ ga@@ este comes only regional .
&quot; as he is also the case of BL@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of the fisher@@ man , he marked the for@@ en@@ cro@@ ft project as &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage on such steep plots .
&quot; the green area prepar@@ es for a lot of work , much m@@ ts with the engine @-@ sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ tiliz@@ ers , even though he does not carry bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the res@@ trained project , and is pleased with the leader of the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are would have to be supported by farmers .
&quot; we hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could still be moved out for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue to operate in their operation , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism because of funding
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013 .
&quot; the closing area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half of the leader was promoted to the village of fishermen . &quot;
&quot; thus we loved the farmer 12 6@@ 10 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of women . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Kor@@ du@@ la K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White , there was best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ spl@@ led Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of women &apos;s fence .
the aim is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &apos;s .
prerequ@@ is@@ ites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR marked .
&quot; in addition , the in@@ consistent area may not be slo@@ wed ( Hang@@ out over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by up@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 it runs the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure of 35 hectares , the kal@@ k@@ uli@@ sted costs are at more than 112 thousand euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the statue of Liberty .
&quot; the safest sign of a regime change , it is when they begin to attack the statues . &quot;
&quot; the Americans appreciate these as much as any other - hence , a care@@ full fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic thr@@ ust in a h@@ it@@ ous dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President of the dras@@ tic immigration of the statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of Bo@@ at@@ land@@ owners and liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators could have made him a yn@@ chron@@ ous when he had done it .
&quot; but he laid their importance , and in particular the importance that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that sh@@ ines the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer later was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is correct properly , but as he form@@ ulating it itself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the sho@@ ok words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your poor , your poor , / your be@@ aks masses , who want to see , free to breathe , / the miserable waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time , in which the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better on our screen . &quot;
Miller committed himself not in liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly made that people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps in the USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who agreed to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well , that they accomplished a highly political act . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice .
and there is even another name : mother of the ex@@ hil@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people want to move from right wing this long for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the dec@@ ay for the advent of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one @-@ conservative , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative daily who is bringing the American flame into the um@@ ented world : &quot; lady Liberty . &quot;
it aims to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something engra@@ ved .
the significance of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it , to see them as they were seen from the exhaus@@ tive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships was seen . &quot;
&quot; it is in the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people , finding refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speak to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ wed sh@@ ot@@ tish Members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two vill@@ i were belonging to the team of Great Britain .
&quot; the capacity of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member states will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ets was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we figure it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ets are medals there , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which was elected against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 metres , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; their surrender speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were ch@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ dh completely natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of Silver Medal , which will compete in their fifth world Championships with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best tot@@ als at the World Championship has been seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid@@ stream mu@@ ir leads on this path and has five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 metres rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another sc@@ allo@@ y that one should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first World Championship , when the only different shot in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was . &quot;
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their land@@ lady will not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thanks to his team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was anyway a great honor to know , but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen me , making it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here established as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise on po@@ e@@ dies . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
&quot; so it is really important to put on this way home support and benefit from it , that we are again at the Olympi@@ astadi@@ on . &quot;
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be as a great atmosphere out there .
blocking of critics concerning Facebook : don &apos;t get a public office if you do not toler@@ ate the li@@ zen of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers sm@@ ote him because of all to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ aded in the cri@@ tique , secure . &quot;
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we shall be guided as the sheep to the battles . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Maryland to governor of Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more than Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the St@@ ab of the Gover@@ nor did the complaint as fri@@ gh@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a return trip with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazing .
he has the second @-@ highest consent of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very pleased to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his ha@@ un@@ ess head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of individuals who come to the Gover@@ nor of Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by workers who are paid by public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ elia spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Am@@ elia spokes@@ man the acts of Gover@@ nor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of Tro@@ ll@@ es or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ tive people who reson@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entre@@ pren@@ eur and a priest , no Tro@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his mail and app@@ alled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; Law@@ y@@ ers@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to break after hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to H@@ ass@@ ver@@ break and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the &quot; &quot; Send &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people are taking place on the same subject , then they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Gover@@ nor was signed as &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ attack &quot; , &quot; would other probably be &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to convert a message by simply blocked a critics or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in past times when one had done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical cor@@ ds , and to burn or to burn prot@@ esters and to silence . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official that he cri@@ tici@@ zed Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump will be blocked by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County has last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District of James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a vot@@ er of their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Pre@@ in received a visit to AC@@ ES because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable POR@@ TOS had a similar effect as the internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous stamp sm@@ ote to his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me such as Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhelmed its position , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought her to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , opinion and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; former European No. 1 Ron@@ an raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days in local comfort , since the Renaissance Club is held in East Lot@@ hi@@ an the 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost next year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the end of the last year before it lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new place of Australia and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club @-@ green and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reached his glory with this event , &quot; said raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
players will see this course from his best side is in a great state .
Jerry made a great job than he put on this place .
he is a sk@@ il@@ ant pro@@ pon@@ ent of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the first time he won a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour &apos;s career as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year @-@ old career . &quot;
&quot; it really feels particularly well , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday , back to the European Senior Tour in this year . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more to play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
I am glad how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ urst , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six tracks in the field , the others are Andrew &apos;s corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a ticket and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pneum@@ atic lo@@ ops through passi@@ v@@ ets
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive exposure to lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; in this result , scientists are coming to the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in one study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates a year 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer is due to passi@@ vity , &quot; said Far@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
at that time there were still 400 mon@@ ary cancer waste due to passi@@ v@@ smoking a year in Germany .

Haus@@ smann prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; ab@@ ad@@ mitt@@ edly in the time &quot; , &quot; the head of the model Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the range of house@@ closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground far , what does not take in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which is always hin@@ dered to the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the road buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the St@@ ump@@ p company have been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very ti@@ ring .

poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina Deg@@ ree coo@@ ks the dinner used it does not use a stove .
it is used even rarely a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ im@@ en in the un@@ ser@@ ene province Pap@@ ua , places the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the shor@@ ten tu@@ bers is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ winding hands and sw@@ allowed . &quot;
Deg@@ ree sits on the lo@@ ß@@ ism - she has no furniture - where it also performs its daily work , e.g. clothing with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a shel@@ ving room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as a youngest of the four wives , their man were not assigned to the fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be dangerous to work dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink difficult , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody knew it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was incorporated in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest should vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which constituted for independence against the Dutch domination , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal surveys . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura after Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive along with the car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo poles , and of cor@@ ru@@ gated ro@@ oft@@ ops which were converted by R@@ ust in various yellow notes . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , as journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , hon@@ orable Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ree and indicates on their lively , handmade gymn@@ ban , its dark @-@ shirt and bri@@ gh@@ ten rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian province where 28 % of men live under poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high mountain province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has been produced in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot;
Pap@@ ua also has wood resources worth more estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; this wealth , however , are a source of misery for the pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indon@@ esian will keep an enligh@@ tening position . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this Golden G@@ ans and are treated gr@@ itt@@ y .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been viol@@ ated from the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass@@ aging in Pap@@ u@@ as stem rise in the 1970 @-@ he years were according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police have more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we adverti@@ ses it in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane in 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the year 2016 , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric hits are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal ra@@ inf@@ all peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week may happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have to be strengthened , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim economic migrants are populated by the populated island of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua for sale , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Ein@@ hei@@ d , who moved to work in the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;

&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the popular and Jo@@ kov@@ i said to address the inequalities and rule of law in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jo@@ kow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jo@@ kow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a deep @-@ point . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motor@@ bike through the darkness .
the ro@@ cking children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in her sound , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who drank , sh@@ aken , and sm@@ ote the group with their gun , said victims and witness . &quot;
then he was hum@@ id one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard pressed that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the near Government Commission was set down in fire and escal@@ ate the things next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried me@@ at@@ onic hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ al@@ ita dance - in the circle permanently and a bird @-@ ges@@ ang im@@ i@@ ti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some prot@@ esters began stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal fun@@ k : &quot; &quot; if the masses were more than three times , shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of T@@ IME , which was not released by local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the elevated risk and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I revol@@ t myself , I suddenly shot in my left hand wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his coloured wooden hut . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not who has folded , but says that the bul@@ let from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here together . &quot;
&quot; it was packed , many shots were fired &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man of Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and under@@ sought his body to ensure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only one name , the T@@ IME into dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted their station only &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; because they shall be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the speaker of Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more viol@@ ated . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only at the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jo@@ kow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he has expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want that this case is immediately resolved , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; safety sm@@ in@@ ister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he had a non @-@ judicial mechanism for the consideration of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the pron@@ unci@@ ations began almost immediately .
&quot; most violations occur a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then he made a retreat when he spoke to T@@ IME , June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said , he did not have plans to set up a complaint . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; accused which accused the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of violations of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been consul@@ ted , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ um . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such statements with sem@@ it@@ ous dis@@ credi@@ tors .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeti@@ tive the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was struck by the army , after he was half the victim to bury . &quot;
&quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought to me &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sh@@ ot@@ ries have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wounded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
defeated vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers St@@ ones were on officers , who re@@ acted to it by stro@@ kes . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( in@@ don@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and a kill .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who was living close to the hospital and witness how the last one has been delivered quickly , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers on account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an in@@ for@@ rest for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green Highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebellion of rebellion which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by driving spor@@ adi@@ sche attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ ya Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the last few years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some could never dive again .
&quot; among men in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place &quot; . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as easy reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between domestic pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new floods to the airport of Nab@@ ire in a larger number . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Executive Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remains tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to poor coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , and gave them the rare permission to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asian @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kow@@ is electoral campaigns were to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian in the most eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - Tong@@ a , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Sal@@ om@@ ons islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widely spread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r refers to the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta , &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to all@@ evi@@ ate the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on site want to take note of more foreign governments this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ bot@@ schaf@@ ters K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 visited ; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also wanted to participate in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the pap@@ ua say that they will probably not be right again for Jo@@ kov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ z@@ kow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ nuts , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jo@@ kow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a clean military . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other pap@@ ua , her voice for Jo@@ kow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; he has to pay . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they only want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ uss@@ und led to the last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ board : the cor@@ pse of a sacrifice was buried on a terrain exactly on the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a s@@ ly head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai his par@@ ici@@ ans , and forced hundreds of residents , of which 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt away through the sky@@ scr@@ aper in just two years , which is gu@@ essing in the tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injury were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept , and we were up with the fire @-@ raid and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ged the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; told a resident who name his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais Civil Protection Auth@@ orities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 AM GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ishes and the building cooled . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be asked questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outside areas of sky@@ scrap@@ ers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; a study caused by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its Brand in 2015 that the largest part of the damages from the fair@@ ing , out@@ lining for decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , they think that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise of the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a meeting in June , in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the AG@@ M .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city that was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single is only supported on two winning players , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but that &apos;s why very cher@@ ished Five @-@ set classics will remain the tradition assessment . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members do not have received the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; at all , not only for the vote was before that the proposal came to a neutral place before that the final trial began to be held on a neutral location . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future will be the host &apos;s right in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in training sessions etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete prior to the Davis Cup less official media events . &quot;
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings botan@@ icals to the plane to find a survey
&quot; a survey among passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously banned items to the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , apply , including at least 6 percent , which bore the airplane while they acci@@ dentally processed kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed them , they had to be del@@ ayed that they may be mist@@ aken with bul@@ lets , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - the survey conducted by a jet charter service , the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was carried out - set also notes that younger travellers are more aware of the rules . &quot;
&quot; asked by the respon@@ dents that they did kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA were 19,@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were seen at T@@ SA agents are inten@@ tionally part@@ ed , food and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent gave rise to the kno@@ w@@ ingly objects with blades used by the security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ dents also affir@@ med that they were inten@@ tionally brought to the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , it inter@@ viewed travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had brought sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers by the airport security and how many things could have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people , most often sm@@ ug@@ gling , kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - by the safety carry those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which liqui@@ ds can take them or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated objects covered by the T@@ SA .
&quot; for a while , people thought the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s canc@@ eled Order
&quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k , there is a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ scored that a part of the customer has moved their non @-@ binding reservation already again . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ umph@@ ant numbers on sales boo@@ sts and yet gig@@ anti @-@ sales goals , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time to bet@@ ray the recent quar@@ terly appearance : those of the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k has often applied more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car over the past few months , whose delivery was just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre@@ orders : 63.@@ 000 already returned . &quot;
critics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; for cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 Dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation service . &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ 5,000 such un@@ warran@@ ted reservations , spatial mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of so far roughly twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 it should be composed - all models - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
loud Mus@@ k is currently coming per day 1800 reservations .
&quot; who ordered today a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; must be ordered early in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in the practice of tested production lines without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum util@@ isation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations could become the problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent the un@@ satisfied customers in the dav@@ elop@@ ment . &quot;
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves to the decre@@ asing rules of the Obama @-@ Era to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after spending from 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , his former decision back to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama @-@ era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities as prior administrator . &quot;
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit against his previous position in a federal state of occupation .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to stick to the standards of 2015 for bottom @-@ bottom o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance for a year to study his authority more time , to study the plan and to avoid , to inter@@ fere with local decisions or to inter@@ fere with economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed chairman of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a long time a reliable opponent of the environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly re@@ pro@@ ving to block regulations or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the accession regular @-@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal government of Washington decided that the EPA has passed its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wednesday evening opinion , P@@ ru@@ itt published the willingness of EPA in accordance with the states through the complex process of timely implementation of new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA has often used the deadlines for carrying out and then to be prosec@@ uted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and agreed in an agreement the date for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdiction , and we take time seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority which we exist , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion said that P@@ ru@@ itt always said its &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the republi@@ cans in the Congress will push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; one last month &apos;s legislation , the implementation of the rules of 2015 will be rel@@ uc@@ tant to delay at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
&quot; the New York @-@ General &apos;s mandate for Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who had rolled the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - after our peti@@ tions - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.6 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly floo@@ ded from smoking , said in their communities . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil zone occurs when poll@@ ut@@ ants consist of cars , power plants , oil raff@@ in@@ ries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight . &quot;
the ent@@ angl@@ ed smo@@ g can cause serious problems in sensitive groups of people serious breathing problems , and every year to thousands of premature death cases . &quot;
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ sion of a profound change of course .
&quot; it is worrying , how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Biological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government , fighting environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the jubil@@ ee church , the old cemetery @-@ area will be invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ bled on Sunday , July 16th , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a Seren@@ ade . &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Seren@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this power@@ fully place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ our in their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ ty Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ customer book : Count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold &quot; The Berg by the Protest@@ ant Church of Tum@@ bled at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the certificate of judgment , upon the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the in@@ scri@@ be parish , a glori@@ fied court belongs to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age rather than the other way round . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as out of the description of the Freu@@ dian Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was in addition to the under@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village of tum@@ our , the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was created from the early medieval pub .
&quot; a Lord who built a church , instruc@@ ted and occupied with a priest , continued his owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this owner . &quot;
associated with this was the right to dep@@ loy a priest and propose a new priest for a new priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ os to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was then in 16@@ 92 , but it was later to be released in 1942 during the Second World War . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of windows were pushed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was tight .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they jour@@ ne@@ yed out the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ pl@@ ished 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery has been extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ al Church broke off .
only the church tower was allowed to stand .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 pointed a storm the church tower and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the tower still available Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained intact as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; creative pension@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
&quot; as an organizer invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July , at the sixth Seren@@ ade on the Old Cem@@ et@@ ery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;

city &apos;s Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; to the end of the Seren@@ ade , there is a trunk @-@ trunk before the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows across the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers will set the fantastic views out . &quot;
the seren@@ ade only takes place at the dry @-@ end weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of significance for tum@@ our and listening .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel especially oblig@@ ated to the home care such as Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
society wants to check permission from bar@@ be@@ ers
Bo@@ is@@ heim re@@ vered : does not look a legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned towards the governor .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim re@@ vered &quot; has requested Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ded ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ et no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal there is a wind power of concentration .
&quot; within this concentration of concentration , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the con@@ domini@@ um zone however poses an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the area . &quot;
the zones are to avoid a &apos; spar@@ kl@@ ness &apos; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided during a few days earlier by a change in the greenhouse gas zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ et - however , however , had not approved the District of Düsseldorf , because of a failure . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of the legal framework the author@@ is@@ cation is alleged to remain un@@ lawful and therefore reduced , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; re@@ vered . &quot;
current status of things : the City Council decided once again the wind con@@ centric zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ et ; permission of the District government is still pending .
&quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit is eliminated for the establishment of wind turbines . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received in the district of Vier@@ sen since past weeks , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , it is likely not likely that the procedure will be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the ongoing proceedings at the administration of the administration , the circle on Thursday was not willing to speak at the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , an affiliate of the NEW , plans to build a surface at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ et construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; over the past year , the company had participated in which the city of Vier@@ sen was involved , p@@ ayed contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs to be covered by about 11 400 households - this corresponds to some fifth of the electricity requirements of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NEW Re hopes to invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy situation in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

&quot; the commercial organisation and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th , to enti@@ ce the inhabitants of shopping stroll into the city centre . &quot;

&quot; in preparation , pro@@ claim on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the Ak@@ tions Week , so Christian King . &quot;
city administration and commercial organisation cooperate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; in this way , the commercial organisation and the city became a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Tag &quot; &quot; to well @-@ sell and sell @-@ in Sunday , talks with all the trad@@ es@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
&quot; as well as attractive offers on the Saturday and the access to parking fees this day , part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be renewed or opened again . &quot;
includes spa guests and tourists .
&quot; but also many natives , the city centre would have lost sight of shopping . &quot;
&quot; in the end all , all of them will contribute to anim@@ ate the inner city - to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; in overcoming it , with a network of overcoming the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y which had made partly , king in the spring had said . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Strei@@ ch , leader of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen distributed to participate in the nation@@ wide third &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ ingi@@ an cities . &quot;

there were only a few people staying in the building of Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump made according to telephone tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scri@@ bed by phone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January Tr@@ ump called Tr@@ ump in a phone with the Mexican presidency En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to say , publicly said that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President accused him , because he had publicly submitted the wall to him , &quot; he said to him , &quot; This is why you cannot say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern edge of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ table were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ au said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; laugh@@ ing &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the cess@@ ation on the trade that was proposed by the President Obama to look like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after he had said Mr Turn@@ to , &quot; This is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury was carried out by a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ bled to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men stood with certainty to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged in a needle @-@ strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside we@@ ars the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bel@@ lows the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; write the silence , as a young black man was ground@@ ed from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene which was played on July 22 , only one draw@@ backs . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience were very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge has returned to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever indic@@ ted because of the murder .
&quot; it really is un@@ question@@ able that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization of post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , the post@@ ure is used as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community , that a w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want tracking , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a jud@@ ging physician sets up a beg@@ gar @-@ to@@ wel on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI , that have been received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding County were suspected . &quot;
but nobody has ever been prosec@@ uted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the open foot for decades , civil rights activists , that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black people in Georgia for the first time to shed their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester was to@@ wed with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried her not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins in Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and then to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch mo@@ b ran by car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , closes this F@@ BI document . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complex between state and local prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the mortality , evidence , and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an El@@ ectiv@@ ist mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade ago Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re@@ setting of the Mo@@ ore Ford bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their presentation is clear , touching and is justified in a kind of deep racism following the many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are then faced with it in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wives and the rest of Black - in a room and sound@@ ing , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ playing overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ co gli@@ eds for years , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the tes@@ ters and pushed it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n . he , w@@ down of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona is hin@@ dered the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs in the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked la@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ick@@ y . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people were told at that time &apos;@@ n --- he said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ zel@@ te one of the other black performers . &quot;
you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that is exactly there the energy in space , a sense of cam@@ er@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this correctly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , it says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends by violent and fast .
&quot; there is crying , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a gro@@ wer ro@@ be dressed , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and guides Bil@@ lie Holidays with pra@@ ising worship &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks into every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided as even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arrived to see the performance , many come only the road . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced all almost eight hours of Georgia , if Bro@@ oks carries them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de has found , the air feels un@@ ground@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; end the final notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ects the cor@@ p@@ name . &quot;
kids ho@@ cken in their minds to register the f@@ ake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ bles a little boy , as a w@@ ool he would like to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and w@@ inian their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the anus , who has played the C@@ lan@@ co . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and then shake together into their arms the emotional burden of performance breaks finally by him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience starts together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; chat@@ ting at a table a white pair from Atlanta stimul@@ ates via the post@@ ure with a black couple , which they have just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me leaves me believe that the Lyn@@ chen is still moving , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police @-@ shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof keeps on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the citizen &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the assignment is inspired in a certain way , as it describes the fri@@ ght of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who has not studied his own history , who has not known his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth

Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner should be happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in some ways , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also a understanding of his view . &quot;
I have a positive res@@ hap@@ ing .

&quot; take a social year , there is a look at it , there you can see how it is on site , in the nucl@@ eus perhaps also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne make a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the Volun@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably always comes on where one makes his FS@@ J .
one can make it from anti@@ quity to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths and see how it really proceeds .
different than in the building of engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to count st@@ ati@@ cal . &quot;
one has repeatedly imagined other people who have a very different story behind .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been caught up from the family - you have always to go into consideration . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no touch of touch ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
there is an area that gives a much .
&quot; love , great kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is just . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts more 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build more 3.000 jobs and cut their inter@@ divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme was started to overcome the pressure , with which the company is confronted . &quot;
&quot; in the vac@@ ancy , the General Manager of John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs were lost . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced a plan in May in a third cost reduction program for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business , which has been hit by the fast step toward digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which , last month , its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House had expressed its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House , said that the outlook for the financial year is unchanged , after having achieved a growth of 1 per cent to € 2,@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier at self @-@ ord@@ attack killed
&quot; a su@@ ic@@ att@@ age has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , one soldiers of Nato killed and several others in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
five soldiers and one interpre@@ ters were viol@@ ated , distributed an explanation of Nato . &quot;
&quot; confirmed by local reports , in the case of the case in the quarter of the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , three civilians were killed . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last non @-@ violence perpet@@ rated by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ held two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato it is said that the explosion was done on Thursday nights , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; people of impro@@ vis@@ ing explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement means that all the last in a stable state are located and in the U.S. military hospital on the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ h@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1.6@@ 62 civilian deaths , of which approximately 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ ic@@ ide @-@ high@@ om@@ be at least 30 people in a primarily Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a tremendous bombar@@ ding in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attacks of the country , since the U.S. led forces in 2001 the Taliban from power displaced . &quot;
&quot; the violence highlights the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering supporting the number of US troops to increase the military and police in the country . &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the auto@@ m@@ ord@@ ances in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ ating what the states are committed to in@@ ges@@ ted the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states reported the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ics 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of the EPA in June to determine where inc@@ isions are to be made , to determine where inc@@ isions are to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay even one year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , published on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ ted a wide range of environmental requirements , which has imposed on former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is noisy to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the withdrawal of democr@@ ats and reserves to worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website tells you that the inhal@@ ing of air , the Oz@@ on contains &quot; the lung function and can reinforce the breath@@ ability symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants common area
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : for two counter@@ parts of the Municip@@ al council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a shared space in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing item is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to be , until now , until now the church of the parish belonged , there is now no planning stage for the project from a private investor to a living project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion concerning a shared space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with about 70 square meters area is available for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council faces such a common area just as a meeting place for the residents of the fair living room , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of the &quot; &quot; strike &quot; &quot; took round . &quot;
&quot; the decision that has been decided by providing funds for the ongoing household already last autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the re@@ development area .
&quot; the establishment of a common space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision precip@@ itation to sign@@ alling the investor that you do not want to throw him a bill@@ ets between the legs , finding that both Sadd@@ ling - which is reduced to ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes it possible and the construction of economic power - is also possible . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ in , be this supplement . &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously passed the body .
it is not as easy as a common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with which you can &apos;t get right now , you say now with the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do very hard with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger himself speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it an un@@ covered sub@@ prevention in any case or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a grant , but just get a real one in the branches of the marketplace , is the counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , dis@@ car@@ ded by the decisions , takes place three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it remains with two counter@@ party in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller will summar@@ ise : &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a giant step into our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with cars : Rad@@ ler is damaged on the street
at the qu@@ itting the road is a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cyclists on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath by a car and severely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year Langen@@ feld was about 12.@@ 20 with his bike on the cycling route of the road Schwar@@ zer route from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the driver wanted to cross the road at the height of the road on the book@@ keeper bus .
&quot; one in the same direction of driving cars , has given him priority . &quot;
&quot; when the fri@@ gh@@ test went on the road , he did not appear to the traffic . &quot;
he came together with a car which controlled a 66 @-@ year assistance .
the man was shining on the street .
he suffered severe injury and was brought to a hospital with ret@@ tu@@ gn@@ ation .

the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with recruitment , the FC Bayern will lead to the first MUS@@ T of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;

&quot; the personnel will keep track of the German football record champion of Bavaria , before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund on Saturday . &quot;
Trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to give up the BV@@ B with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
the confirmed the Italians on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ jen Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test An@@ cel@@ otti played the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his crew .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an performance increase in the first official mandatory match of the season . &quot;
&quot; soccer is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows this qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense play . &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attract the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spect@@ ators , distributed the Deutsche Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; will be created .
this is planning the Club Observ@@ atory San@@ kt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Plan@@ eten@@ weg exists in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star@@ ring path &quot; coming to the information of many Har@@ z@@ ke@@ epers , it meant . &quot;
&quot; linking nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
members want to exhibit along the planned route and inform you about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; well achiev@@ able installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; request of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the tablets should be suppl@@ emented by internet .
&quot; therefore , in the selection of thousands of choice , a good mobile network reception plays a role . &quot;
also accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star @-@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ring path , the viewers will experience a great deal of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned how stars could have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ ous than another , although he is significantly further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constell@@ ation is a sel@@ ectable star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating at the San Andre@@ as@@ berg mountain region since 2014 . &quot;
the site in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park goes according to the Federal Ministry for Natur@@ schutz on the six dark regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with a naked eye clearly visible .
in the uni @-@ city there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ turm Gött@@ ingen something similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - Plan@@ etary weg .
&quot; starting before Geb@@ har@@ ud Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary weg path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Municip@@ ality ) with the planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ uto at the end point - are exactly on the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks , so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meter diameter , whereas the exactly 75 meters removed the sun has 70 cen@@ timeters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is good four kilometers .
&quot; while the lights needed from sun to Pl@@ uto for about eight hours , ped@@ est@@ rians need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ rians are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would still last a half years .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who are in a coll@@ ision to compete in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ covered World Box@@ ing Council light@@ weight champion , down the hallway to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ ather @-@ champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through an agre@@ eable decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched the right hand and said , &quot; How do you go , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko defended its belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple offered for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ no , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I am ascen@@ ded for bronze &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to download on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight : 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 pound de@@ bit in this year in order to arrange a date in the battle against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ title championship in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans were asked about him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and op@@ ted later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he cher@@ ished Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held a lot of pra@@ y@@ ly praise for Gar@@ cia , and said that he &apos;d think the &quot; &quot; battle champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry to Mi@@ key ... you really wanted the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show strength , then box@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; they both said , they could sense the momentum that he built for the own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which must be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work in it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have waited for the top @-@ fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four in@@ ju@@ red after tire break@@ er
&quot; at an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously wounded on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the launch of the market , presum@@ ably after a tire space he lost control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger sh@@ ud@@ dered to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he covered himself and then stayed on the roof of the green strip . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - have been heavily in@@ ju@@ red by the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the last through the lif@@ ebo@@ at service , the A7 was locked towards north for about an hour , then the traffic could pass by road on the left lane . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoff@@ mann hopes after 2 : 2 on the season open@@ er against uns@@ wick that the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e will bring .
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoff@@ mann was happy with the result , the two oppos@@ it@@ ors were not at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two enemies too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Ore Mountains , the tri@@ ck@@ ette should also be further optimized . &quot;
and a goal after a cl@@ ash do not want to catch the tro@@ tun@@ es even more .
for the future it will be so that no more alongside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) raises to the line .
&quot; Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team can better cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ tree , than with the four . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach , Fried@@ m , but Hoff@@ mann is sure to be able to build up the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we can make even better balance and we do not make as many play@@ mistakes . &quot;
&quot; of course , too Hoff@@ mann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a miserable start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; however , in case we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the trophy , we will certainly speak of a decent season . &quot;
of this his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I had after six to eight toys , told Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely had to be broken . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann might be that the players from Au@@ e might even be some fresh , as it could have no he@@ ap and complete play as Fort@@ una against a ascen@@ sion @-@ favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know that 100 process , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ ender of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although , guests from the Rhin@@ eland take an easy favorite on Sunday to the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , bull@@ sh@@ it , says Funk@@ body , whose balance sheet is very positive in a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the outset , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t , arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Bal@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ ic medicine ( R@@ ät@@ tner @-@ cy@@ cin@@ er@@ en@@ et ) has started with the performance of the test last year .
&quot; they should be more precise during the asylum process of the age of age , after the Swedish migration Authority ( migration cuts ) was critic@@ ised for errors when assessing the correct age of several refugees . &quot;
&quot; up to the present time , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ et 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent out and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency surv@@ ey@@ ed that the person may &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old .
the tests will only be conducted in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see big difference in statistics last months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has weigh@@ ed over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the analysed person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det searched the results published by 5@@ 81 , they found that in 243 these cases the person had said to be frank@@ ly that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , in x @-@ rays of wisdom @-@ rays and MR@@ T recordings are made of knee br@@ aces , which then analyzed from dentists and radi@@ ologist , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; skep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work embr@@ aces the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they went to sooner or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we can not say it certainly we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to in@@ correctly judge an adult as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is about if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis was made on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , farmer at the Department of street and Transport in the Government of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , working at all three main bridges from Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach started at the same time . &quot;
&quot; construction is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is safe , that the timing is respected . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , it is now in the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ constructed . &quot;
the two other bridges guide over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bur@@ ge@@ ars .
&quot; this is a boundary wall , which is also used as an operating way . &quot;
on the south part of the bridge the bridge should be inserted into a wide brid@@ ge@@ al cap on Friday .
then it shall be out of the pedestrian path .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about the production , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented brid@@ ging process .
particular finger@@ tips has the handling of lines due to the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; for there , also , a glass fiber can also be connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed in the run of work by hand@@ piece on the project .
&quot; in addition , the fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be folded . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building blocks and the gathering , towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic lights . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work at the bridge on the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Local entrance , the street is locked in the area of the bridge on the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of three inc@@ and@@ ro@@ ds are comprised of 700 000 Euros .
financed by the whole country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not come so frequently that parties are moving to a string , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the two parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , left ) belong to a broad coalition which shows on this day peac@@ efully , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell for the &quot; &quot; great election &quot; &quot; invites . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names of the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which is together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top @-@ duo for the German Bundestag on September 24 , and the dep@@ uty chief of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ ales , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a pretty colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , really rejoice : &quot; great how many people have come here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad which could also eat the Af@@ ak without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him with . &quot;
&quot; the police has depic@@ ted many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reports ; he has been trying to make such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked first in Dau@@ n , but there was a query , because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch were not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes are happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle &#124; Red@@ ner , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the German did@@ ac@@ eur for the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ ch to hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; slightly more than an hour takes the Af@@ ak event , the guests at the court have a longer breath , but even there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can put back - no special achievements .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i , in the series Has@@ l@@ acher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ kirche . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov there is a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ Sea &quot; at Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in concert music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ o@@ osi@@ tions in European pl@@ ain@@ ly minist@@ ries .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ is the SWR Symphony .
&quot; both united the desire to exceed the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; so Johann Sebastian Bach that sounds like in a new gar@@ ment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ mb@@ als N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , mix classical , jazz and the free games to a fascinating total work . &quot;
this key piece of the program was not listed until this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has written it independently for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery with its special acou@@ sti@@ cs is deliberately involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat him until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is totally open about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I went to gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as a neighb@@ or ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Dutch stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally happened hard . &quot;
&quot; despite all the guarantees the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin against the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in every serious case that I have dat@@ et . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten announced that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; I never liked it , not serious about being taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them I have lou@@ dly called &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school @-@ time when they prefer a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really has me very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a be@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked and embarrass@@ ed and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; now look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to live their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way , and that anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some consider me to be un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with lots of prayers and much memory ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had a great announcement in the West Virginia Rallye .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not endor@@ se the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
Justice which is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has inherited K@@ ohl@@ em@@ inen in five states and has inherited a coal @-@ shop from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night gave an explanation , in which it said , &quot; The Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , who would work rather than working to do our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 sec@@ recy and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice just the final rejection of a party which is from above down without leadership and unable to find a positive , complete message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ wed &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday , which he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of his country from the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off on competitions , gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments voted the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of For@@ bidden , which was in November 2015 , after a report of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) notes on state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia had been found . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the whole congress were pleased to realize that Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that she has experienced some quite hot times and do everything possible to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the leit@@ principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; he added
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics world Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug testing is still inadequate and forbidden coach are still free , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London following a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
grapes for Mali ab@@ stain@@ ed soldiers
&quot; at a funeral service in the north@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two launched a helic@@ opter in Mali re@@ union soldiers . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .
&quot; for yet more un@@ explained Ab@@ duc@@ tions said defense ministers Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) , nothing . &quot;
&quot; it referred to the two revers@@ als , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; we are uns@@ atis@@ ed before that highest victim , which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their sentences were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a totalit@@ arian @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral San@@ kt Peter .
&quot; at lunch@@ time , only the relatives were at the church said goodbye . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , by representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
beneath these were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the governor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; gn@@ u@@ ties laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were rich in arms in his arm . &quot;
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; the Minister of Defence from the Ley@@ en referred to as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sat@@ een . &quot;
the St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the air operation of the martial @-@ helic@@ opter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with one of the first six trained tigers pil@@ ots in his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , then there was nobody . &quot;
doubt at the UN @-@ Mission in Mali the minister of Ley@@ en showed not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral feast the Slav@@ s were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed , the Bundes@@ wehr have no information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by his death beside his wife . &quot;
the shared the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish Royal Palace is attached to the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already been a Sar@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband &apos;s decision it was further in the press release .
where prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he was not the intent to set aside in his French home country .
&quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a fl@@ our , that he was not happy with his title . &quot;
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; 2016 he reti@@ re in retirement , and also sets the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ c@@ ite &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title , and the function he wanted to see himself as equal - even not after death , said L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the chief priest of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately still unclear .
&quot; but he was not the intent to set aside in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ ats , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people had always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at his almost 50 years of age . &quot;
in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did .
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , Seiden@@ str@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itted , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco , and that in this country had the reputation of being the brand of soci@@ opoli@@ tical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not asham@@ ed .
these were the same two faul@@ ts ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election

&quot; precip@@ itation , Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is returned to the loss of red @-@ green registr@@ ars for a quick re @-@ election of the land @-@ day , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; however , the Friday for the resolution of the Parliament spoke out . &quot;

CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ e@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its faction to it .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP could have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new landing day will be reg@@ ained on 14 January coming year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they would be able to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does however , however , is indispensable for the country &apos;s country as quickly as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further procedure on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Prince &apos;s version also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s country has chosen the trust and elect a successor . &quot;
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these options must be tested legally clean &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will be deb@@ ated in peace all questions , if they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ wes@@ terly Step &quot; but something short of short . &quot;
the political leader itself said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it recorded as a trailer of black @-@ green .

&quot; we of course assume that she has received her landing stage , which she has received over the green country list , distributed with immediate effect , distributed the National Bank of Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the presidents of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
they deliberately decided not to lead any discussion in the group .
&quot; also against the background that there were no differences of differences , we can not understand this step . &quot;

he suppor@@ tive the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s day .

&quot; land Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussed by si@@ gh@@ ed eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Land@@ economic Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is present in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speaking and response .
Lord Schmidt and How can the consumer protect against po@@ ison@@ ous eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ amping pressure .
&quot; at the consumer &apos;s consumer portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ .com , the federal states are providing the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually eliminated . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - , because the central role of the awareness of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately been switched off and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has the same as the manufacturers to worry about it , that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and health . &quot;
&quot; if at eggs of the back@@ level of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not restricted . &quot;
un@@ contaminated eggs however can be sold and consumed .
this time does not blame the farms .
sit production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after the time of time , the factories has no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they need to count on account of mut@@ u@@ dly illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
as always there is in the har@@ vest@@ ing too little contro@@ l@@ le@@ ure .
is it missing only on the staff or also on the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth was also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent provision of such acts and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be governed , of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made a lot of times over many times , that I expect from the responsible authorities for seam@@ less clarification . &quot;
is the regular alarm clock in food processing really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to only secure safe and reduced food .
&quot; if a non @-@ racial insec@@ tici@@ de in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly asham@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; thus , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation , which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ making animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
this must be consistent and worked on all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities to clarify the fact that the atomic fact is justified and fully justified .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moves to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ paved issues of European foot@@ football , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A EURO , as the leading organisation that the European game has super@@ vised the power , cre@@ ws of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which have been launched by the UEF@@ A EURO , means that PS@@ G has to point out , that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 262 million $ ) to recover the Brasi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moved to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure that the money is easy to do with N@@ ey@@ mar , and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy of rich rulers of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to fund a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must deal with legitimate acceptance sources , which allow them to enable the Bre@@ ak @-@ Even point in her to the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election as the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs in their pursuit of success had enormous debt on themselves , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and risky to ruin , if banks or owners with@@ drawn their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P by focusing on the debts of the clubs on the surveillance of their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that was used novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P payment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses at an amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen down from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be able to disp@@ atch of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely the FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the filing for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the year @-@ leaving certificate .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the har@@ dest sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a donation of 60 million Euros ( back to 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 is limited to 21 players in normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that might try to over@@ look their financial supervision by connected their revenue by companies who are connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ able company could inhi@@ bit the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A should not be considered as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar about payments of the Organis@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be able to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A is still more attentive , each attempt to observe the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre@@ matur@@ ely conversation with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , expres@@ sing the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 showed a profit of over 10 million euros with a turnover of over EUR 10 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship @-@ De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dising and tri@@ kot@@ sing . &quot;
the Association assumes that sales after signing up at least 30 percent is rising .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ ri@@ fied , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ suit by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; pre @-@ financing dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said president of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s latter owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager arsen@@ al Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the finan@@ ci@@ play Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y on board made chocolate for the Swiss made .
&quot; now , close cooperation is ahead of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract . &quot;

no@@ stalgia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; to the N@@ ish
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the glorious days of the 80 @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ years @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the pioneers of David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels as if the time was short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprising good , not only because of his absurd car@@ ors ( it enth@@ elt a original story for a speaking c@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle age play hor@@ le children , which are grown - they nevertheless made the im@@ possibility to win the last part of W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who now play adults is less emotional , and his par@@ ody goes more about the Stal@@ ker films of 90 @-@ he years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which looked the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; there is a character from an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , a few in@@ line sk@@ ates and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot that is included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
how always are the courses of the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who is Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could show this fran@@ chise like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; whose final scene will show the &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now reminds of another kind of no@@ stalgia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ edy Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka formed Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , to be a Found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which are for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main tro@@ ll@@ es - a tough be@@ ek@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs of chann@@ eling Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced to English . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice gifts to see ( the police spend the time about chess on television , how Americans might do it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous spokes@@ men - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer which carries a Re@@ agan mask , it is often considered as a single one . &quot;
&quot; after six long episodes , it draws itself and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ comp@@ acted to a lower length , could provide its Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef ever visit the American message whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our@@ ing a he@@ ap of ham@@ burger . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inated Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a money .
the ti@@ tious Romanian creator did not go wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police were a blow to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , at the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for , as the prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 15 , 15 notes were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ t against this . &quot;
&quot; the officials presented larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundreds of thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same raid in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany probably after Germany .
an action was Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia is organised crime crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , su@@ cks murder and ex@@ tor@@ tion and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Prosec@@ ution Con@@ stance against organised drug @-@ trade ties in the South German territory have been established . &quot;
&quot; between the Prosec@@ ution in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil , almost every day contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; thus , the large @-@ scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , there were mainly Italian national , with a closer reference to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident took place on May 27th , in the morning , at which early in the morning several shots were fired into a Gast@@ stätte , looks forward to the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy account . &quot;
a large gaps in the foreig@@ ner of the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens , which should not appear &quot; : a report , according to a report , the foreig@@ ner Register in Germany has significant shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to some serious mal@@ choices in asylum procedures .
&quot; the author for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , has made aware of a media report according to large gaps in the country of country . &quot;
&quot; shortcomings in the data of registered data could lead to asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; in an analysis that presented the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , ten million people with foreign nation@@ als is captured , including about 5.5 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has hitherto been not good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become the German citizen and actually no longer arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ tions can greatly slo@@ wing it down , the report is still further down . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed people , this EU citizen may be seized , that would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such false addresses , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16 @-@ year children back to Italy if they are fed by there . &quot;
&quot; this arises from an internal paper of the Federal Ministry for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ak@@ er Zeitung reports . &quot;
&quot; in the paper , there is therefore the BAM@@ F lead such procedures related to families with children - except inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the paper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot;
&quot; if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to a single country . &quot;
&quot; for reasons I write the office now , &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with min@@ t children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for reception and accommodation for families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) do not keep these commitments enough .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to Dublin as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the interior political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a haz@@ ard to the child . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions that were carried out in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0,25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will likely be announced later , that interest rates are remaining unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation took over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; orders &quot; &quot; will remain when they accum@@ ulate the interest rates on family income in the midst of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding the interest rates on 0,25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for a raise . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly review , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 that the pressure on budget would continue to continue , whereby inflation in the autumn is expected to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ aled that in the next few years of Zin@@ ovi@@ ch was necessary to bri@@ gh@@ ing the Bre@@ xit inflation , and they said that the credit costs may need more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the m@@ amm@@ ut business package that was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will request time for funding plan to provide finance funding for banks from the coming February to provide less than 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as pressure on the real income of households continue to be charged . &quot;
&quot; the interest rates repeti@@ tive that there would be a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy , for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; extent necessary than the markets expected . &quot;
markets forecast at present the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however the Bank stressed that increases term &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ asted growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1.9 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecasts on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages from the dollar and the Euro .
the Po@@ unds fell by 0.5 % to all US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to the 1.11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth paid the rising expectations on a zinc @-@ cave , and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
growth is expected to be reduced in the third quarter at 0.3 % although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
&quot; the most recent in@@ flow report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an increasing inflation and a low level of balance , since the tigh@@ tening is still worse before it will get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be avoided in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages are predicted to recover at the end of its three @-@ year progn@@ osis &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by the rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak Po@@ unds , which will compens@@ ate for a part of the lower consumption . &quot;
the decision comes from a year after lowering the interest rates on 0,25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the mer@@ ged of the sound @-@ produced .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and economy fully .
&quot; prior to the final verdi@@ ct of the Bank to interest rates , the reputation had risen upon a fork figure since inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July for an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; it dropped last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.8 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be re@@ bo@@ iled in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exce@@ eding in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; completely &quot; to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the shorter back@@ rest of the s@@ wap market , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders would look far to stores and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those with the existing defensive and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) shall be controversial to write HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people &quot;
patients will be retained after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England also announced that prior to sexual intercourse prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can decrease the infection haz@@ ard at high risk exposure to around 86 percent , is now delivered by healthcare service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process , after the appeal of the Court held last year a verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice had confirmed that the N@@ HS had to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens than &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; whereas the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) was referred to as a &quot; decisive moment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first include that will follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in all of England . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drug supplements that will be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission with infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or as two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment in question , include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successful . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants will identify the study involving the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not monitored by anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered in a veterinary surgeon , can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating Sex@@ clinic . &quot;
&quot; the program is signed by £ 10 million , and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medicines that week after an international competitive procurement . &quot;
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used in large scale and implemented . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards prevention of HIV supplement and over@@ take .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted at need@@ y and vulnerable people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk gaining access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really checked individually and is not subject to a hearing with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is quickly carried out in the whole country , and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the pre@@ p test medicine has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow of Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ated implementation by the government and over@@ due the government . &quot;
the evidence will show how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transfer of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the ending of the prolifer@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designers @-@ tricks this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment converted into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has un@@ packed their bags and has sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I searched for something , which was similar to my prize . &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with her and made a quote on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit the 1,000 square meters has been completely out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; originally , one @-@ room estate with a w@@ asted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage room and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose they instruc@@ ted the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to release the prevention .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged , that they were over@@ thrown , without giving us a gaps . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but put it in steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of common drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic coupl@@ ing window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver bul@@ ding and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumin@@ ations put the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is reflected in order to operate it longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the reflection of a window feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance they mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the ey@@ eb@@ rows and glasses of jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room may include the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
together @-@ up kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a clo@@ ak@@ room .
&quot; a bit of engineering , went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is essential so it , if you move the door , very slightly gli@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cl@@ ever@@ ly use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ diment@@ ary form , a real estate bro@@ kers will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they made it to enlarge the floor area and use high quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and hence help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not ad@@ ore you into the electrical socket , in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter size from something to an astonishing turn into something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers are fighting for an 500 million US property imperial .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the greatest property imperative Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business is to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul did not want to retreat since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; with her mother Anna , brothers had bought 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since then the family had bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans , and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the town centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her died Father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis is described - about two thirds of the company &apos;s company and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction that means that col@@ im has the value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul within the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a direct point for Paul .
&quot; the ages proposed by Col@@ in proposed rates have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday for several periods .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - from which Paul maintains , as Paul maintains that it was excluded . &quot;
&quot; argu@@ ed , this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to put the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs will rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides by law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her stor@@ k husband Luigi were Italian immigrants that bought the milk bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in high school , when Paul was still a small child ( approximately 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property g@@ le to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brethren in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark in leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , says Paul &quot; about the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back although he was a former AF@@ L team member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media recorded with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in rep@@ lied via SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts may be . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain about and to draw our family name through the courts &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in in a letter wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not know that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and he added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday these hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts &quot; , &quot; Col@@ in . &quot;
Tr@@ umps new Stab@@ sch@@ ef is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new St@@ ef des White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the chef on an equivalent course . &quot;
here is a piece of Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new St@@ ef des White House , joined together with his first working day , he was a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he fixed : bad information to get into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to en@@ cro@@ wing Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media monitoring .
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relation to TV has come back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Candi@@ date was anno@@ yed because of a fair reporting was it productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at that time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold the umps on Twitter , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media use includes a ste@@ er praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps on Twitter are ever &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign findings know something that we don &apos;t know others - that tr@@ umps has not included any more cre@@ ase without their intervention .
we will probably never experience something about the we@@ ets which has not sent tr@@ ump .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times , to keep him away from him , then their efforts have been worth it . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevent it , that Tr@@ ump inspec@@ ting control . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem consists in that the people in a white house , which consists of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may potentially cause their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - deals with this story - reported in May on the fon@@ dness of the consultants , to the president of strategic reasons for further information . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials said that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press @-@ cuts , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he turns out to figure out from where they come . &quot;
&quot; this happened in the end of February , when someone gave the president of mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty rod in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; though Johnson because of Schi@@ kan@@ en permanently from Twitter , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he spoke wrong accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them in the past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump read the article , and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; gold makers added that the then Stab@@ sch@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ ri@@ m and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors always strive for influence . &quot;
these in@@ variable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ ges@@ u@@ ded crimin@@ als get the post of Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all of Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to a dangerous criminal on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the requested sword @-@ bre@@ wers natur@@ ale is not known , are advised and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows on the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many wings on holiday destinations are hiding , it meant by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
one has put together 21 post@@ cards for a criminal criminal off@@ ences from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 The Online ges@@ ons could not be arrested , at least eleven of it because of hints after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some deci@@ de@@ dly travelers on war foot@@ ing that have tr@@ aded a field in front of their manor houses .
&quot; the travellers have indicated their 20 caravan on a field outside a well @-@ aff@@ lu@@ ent road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ gs series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after they were brought down only in May , without being de@@ duc@@ ted from one by the Council to prevent their waste . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ t@@ full group found a gap in the defense units , and op@@ ted their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way . &quot;
&quot; desert inhabitants have pushed the council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , said that it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; &quot; They were pulled back on Sunday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they were thrown into pas@@ sers @-@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into practice by shame , because when dealing with the problem was useless . &quot;
the travelers were there in May and are now back again .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long cap@@ tions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my par@@ ity if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a people who wanted not to be called , said , &quot; It is ridicul@@ ous , we just have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to pl@@ under@@ ed from another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have raised this time , and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a perpet@@ rated camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls together . we take the necessary legal steps so as to move on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our reference collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants will report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and should be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , by the then ambi@@ ance @-@ held factory , was lost approximately 30 000 nights per year and proceeds from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in the view of dramatic the numbers of refugees , which entered into the district district , the hotel building owned by the country @-@ rat@@ ed@@ ingen as a collective accommodation , which was cat@@ ered for contro@@ versy . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ controversial at that time .
&quot; but above all Fre@@ den@@ stadt , Ober@@ bourgeois , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the location , and said then at that time of serious interested new@@ com@@ ers in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ straße with business leader Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ ü@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and will make it back to a house of the Three @-@ star @-@ Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ b .
&quot; you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing in front of the entrance for a longer time and when one enters the house , it becomes clear , what ample renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been min@@ ated , blank@@ ets partly dra@@ fted , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large gi@@ fted showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built in . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; beautiful people &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece , &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room includes the equipment . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is wide open , we are further explained . &quot;
both single travelers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has managed so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer intends to determine not exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; external systems are also brought to the front , and this is clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Com@@ er@@ ers Com@@ peti@@ tive Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair , for US President Donald Tr@@ ump shall have used special fe@@ eder Robert Mu@@ eller according to a report called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; the panel has recorded the work in the last weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; on appeal to the job familiar . &quot;
the paper highlighted the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended its investigation and intensified .
&quot; the sender CN@@ N reported , there was already the first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the panel relating to a meeting between Tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. secret services accused the Krem@@ lin for a long time , specifically into the presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps El@@ ection team and Moscow .
&quot; at the focus of investigations , several men are to stand , who acted in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to it , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps in private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the Sonder@@ borg Tr@@ ump gave personally to the center and looking for the accus@@ ation , whether the president may hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether the indic@@ t@@ ment shall be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called Prosec@@ ution .
mostly they are switched when it comes to bigger and contro@@ versy cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched from the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office to pre@@ di@@ ct people for hearing under the E@@ id .
according to the sender CN@@ N were already exhibited pre @-@ inv@@ itations to the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement , it was called in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ umps advis@@ er and swi@@ eg@@ ers@@ son Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening television , that the condition can show that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t be in@@ timi@@ d in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on the end to decide on the collection of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the replacement of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President was used on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing but they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he knows nothing about the installation of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but also work in the secret , he said . &quot;
the White House fears any actions that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; fair way .
the former F@@ BI @-@ chief James Com@@ ey was told three times that will not be established against the president .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that something has changed , it says in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had been used only after Tr@@ ump com@@ ey had been fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this deck were alleg@@ ations against Tr@@ ump made loud , he did not want to inter@@ fere with the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump made him a attitude of investig@@ ators against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to U.S. media , the White House gathered the White material against the special equipment and its employees . &quot;
the hol@@ low spec@@ ulation about it if Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; unlike any independent non @-@ investig@@ ator of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair per@@ ated to the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired at the President of the President of the Court of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow to such a step however .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators held on Thursday legislation before , after which the particular investig@@ ator could no longer be reli@@ eved . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Ic@@ eberg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has solved itself from the seven @-@ seven size of Berlin from the hor@@ ses@@ hoe . &quot;
that divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the pist@@ on over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large pist@@ on stri@@ fe after north and I will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice cream , researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people does not go out of him .
&quot; how climate change has played a role in the break@@ down of the ice , is unclear remains unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , for some thirty years , however , it has been a series of unusual break@@ downs of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can coinci@@ de with the heating @-@ up . &quot;
the pist@@ on pist@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
Schel@@ del@@ s on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and collap@@ ses regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this Schel@@ del@@ ine was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and canc@@ ers some years ago disturbed .
&quot; a complete Schel@@ del@@ s be there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine is in danger , as the pre@@ conceived edge has never drawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate under tension and could be dis@@ solved , if in a key place a piece can be crus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ del@@ s and ic@@ eberg lifted the sea level , as they pass on the water and pus@@ hes ice as much water as it is after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the tr@@ ench also leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the lesser degree , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ ses@@ s is after AW@@ I @-@ details with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth @-@ largest Schel@@ del@@ s of the Antarc@@ tica .
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it &apos;s a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ e@@ plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the worst retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot;
&quot; among scientists have been disp@@ uted , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s will again grow or re @-@ re @-@ go and possibly mer@@ ged all , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; although this researchers did not return the break@@ down of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in the past few decades many king@@ fis@@ sion of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula will fall . &quot;
this long run of Antarc@@ tica covers South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the temperature .
&quot; the Antarc@@ tic peninsula have turned around three degrees over the past 50 years , and thus en@@ umer@@ ated in the areas where the temperature at the fastest growing . &quot;
CD@@ U wants a heal@@ er if personnel
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult to occupy freely jobs , the CD@@ U calls out of the working @-@ association to be more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the roundabout 41 new jobs took place in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the roundabout in M@@ ett@@ mann .
17 trainees have once again had their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
some 620 App@@ lic@@ tions were available in vain for those in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to manage staff to meet the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
there are currently 50 connected lines at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are chosen as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U will now wish to take the initiative with the F@@ PD and U@@ W@@ G the Initiative and the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; after the request of the parties , the administration should work out to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; it is the aim not only to cover short @-@ term needs of specialists , but future @-@ oriented of the assessment , is called it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should focus on the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve a balance sheet , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do it with staff problems , which one did not know earlier . &quot;
other cities advertise good officials and provide more attractive conditions .
the speech is by a ver@@ itable &quot; contest of public employers . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a high number of employees , the disease or altern@@ ately was dis@@ car@@ ded out of the service . &quot;
so the highest time for action so do not remain un@@ occupied yet .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common form with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was long ago already in the rot@@ ary day for a lazy surprise , when he asked for the pay@@ pal publicly in question and the rest of the parties were intrigu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; people want that all possibilities are checked , that allow all the opportunities to co @-@ bound up from the municipal employer . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should seek the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the circular cities - a Hau@@ star@@ if &quot; , &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; with this , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tries to pay better than the collective for@@ estation of the Public Service actually fores@@ een . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you switch to a higher level that are oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established , in which the employees had to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone of the NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats .
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue , if they don &apos;t keep on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Con@@ duct , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner &apos;s Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ niti@@ s warning came one day , after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Save &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organization , which has been in operation only since one year , rejected it to express themselves at detailed accus@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor of the Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all accus@@ ations , which are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth Save &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , super@@ vised since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his occupation of infl@@ atable migrants took on board , which can be delivered directly by men &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be used , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred , just 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , the content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected about the authority of the Italian coastal country , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not super@@ vised by any other moti@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have above all have an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have previously prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; their lif@@ ebo@@ ards . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates physicians without limits ( M@@ SF ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants that arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , which has declined in recent weeks , that efforts to strengthen the Libyan territorial waters and co @-@ operation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali above measures to reduce the number of migrants that can reach these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire this very new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is for sure , that on these train may also come several shifts . &quot;
&quot; the next weekend the football World Association will organize FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; in which the gam@@ er of various clubs compete with each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg have qualified for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen advis@@ es an agency for virtual soccer player .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year @-@ old , that the young people are still going into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the compar@@ isons , all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be a lot more often more often on these markets than once in the year to send the federal government to Asia once a year . &quot;
what does it work exactly ?
&quot; by e @-@ sport games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ ons have established itself , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
and among Asian 2022 e @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many is the idea to be safe in need .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been addressing the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and showing many biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classic sport - for example increased heart rate , stress interactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it also need cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
the fine player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; stro@@ be , but also problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to run in online games , and in the scene fails the structures of classic sport . &quot;
&quot; positive , the scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; the players are on the move internationally , this is like a great global family , since there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the association &apos;s Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
sales up to 130 million are expected in three years .
against the approximately 2.@@ 4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga is not enough .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ gers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is a lot of things .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as lessons , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
in the Netherlands and in France the Bundes@@ liga al@@ liga is obliged to set up a new e @-@ sport department in the meantime .
&quot; in the European comparison of Germany , V@@ f@@ B @-@ board declares R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stalgia to fall , and the old days to be clari@@ fied , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore going to preserve the tradition of the association , but to al@@ ign the company at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; there you can &apos;t say that only when football remains everything , as it always was . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the texts to supp@@ ress the Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ ic@@ ide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to gran@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June because of the casual pottery of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ apped .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter could be allowed to stay free up to the appeal .
&quot; it has been faced with a top of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered at a psychological disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream @-@ colored fl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down in judicial eyes , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ ors to the court . &quot;
she ended his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; it has not taken any responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said , it is a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they completely regret . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity or even their cl@@ ergy have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read an explanation by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there was no day in which I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters being there , &quot; says it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be prosec@@ uted by the recognition , that they will never be part in the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer the only person having been together with whom I had been together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ rier &apos;s text en@@ ig@@ saw that she has encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging you on , spr@@ ing@@ springs of a building , er@@ ste@@ che yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; all you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched for the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they would benefit by any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few , the Carter defended , belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was condemned in 2007 because of murder in her British co @-@ hostess in Italy before she was released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times , published a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua played me at the Audi Cup as captain came no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner has not passed a big season - Extra @-@ motivation .
&quot; something was there different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ my immediately , even if the extra dress piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m , and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself the shared bin@@ k at the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
good one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of coach could also suggest that Kim@@ me .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen in youth leaders , Deb@@ u@@ anten and just from the holiday @-@ appointed professionals of the C @-@ El@@ f , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; sugar@@ l is distributed , at those de@@ ar@@ est to those who want to spend a lot that one wants to keep in mood . &quot;
&quot; who thus has been au@@ c@@ ted to stand the heritage of L@@ ame , a small extra @-@ motivation can only make good use . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did their rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , that of Kim@@ me in this entry form like the one who can best take the ruin . &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ signed tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole while many others were engaged in itself .
&quot; Vi@@ dal therefore , to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ d@@ ded hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches towards the devil come out to the benefits of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ly also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
the after all went very well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both ag@@ gre@@ ed supreme . &quot;
the un@@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , in addition addi@@ le tried to successfully develop a few times in the game construction . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy finally gave me that the result was &quot; not as we had hop@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , temperature change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still available for new access , one looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me spoke after a few cr@@ ack@@ y statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard about an interesting phrase : &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
you just need to gain each game with Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not need to teach the new one . &quot;
Al@@ aba motivated Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Ladies

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ alz ministers : economy lo@@ wed Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it often proved to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( green ) nor economic minist@@ ries of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected after more than one year in which the new business is Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) in office .
chambers and corporations from the region talk to T V @-@ inquiry of a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ending at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ er Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes blocks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke office . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of nat@@ us sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the ascent of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now in the primary list of the country .
&quot; this year the Ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 the building should be right . &quot;
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Tri@@ er which stands in the pre@@ urgent need for the traffic @-@ traffic plan .
&quot; aim is to take the track in service in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial speaker Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks , as seen by Wis@@ sing , in wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Label in order to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to base its own company , lo@@ ds the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er looks a added incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium of 1,000 euros for the highest master of master and 2500 Euros as a result of gradu@@ ates within ten years after the competition . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
&quot; at the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time out of the country in the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , principal business leader of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to adjust to urban mobility have only been occupied with 29 places so far . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce ur@@ ges to more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ fraction Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the invoice , the country invested 2017 and 2018 over EUR 20 million less in the preservation of other roads than suggested . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country like the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
ern@@ ü@@ ch@@ tern@@ d also has the previous broad@@ band construction in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had evaluated the supply supply in an i@@ HK survey only with the note 3.4 .

Audi is supposed to alter 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face up with a bac@@ kl@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would be offering to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said , the company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; it gives smart options as driving limits &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based on diesel vehicles or limiting . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes @-@ vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ i@@ des , the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to be checked , take also to what it makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to pamp@@ er the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called sealing devices , which could regulate the rules if a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees have been charged by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Germany was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put to justice in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen , after the authorities have installed Audi to handle the emission rules in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen hard to strain : the luxury automobile manufacturers contributes to the profits of Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most @-@ known car@@ to@@ on carto@@ ons ; the no@@ oll@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still working and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed himself as a drawing for bl@@ iss@@ ful cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after they moved to Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
over and over again the artists are inspired by cities .
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cro@@ lling in drawings with the sh@@ ale Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on a character , even today , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush and watches find his dro@@ ll figures still have much spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favorite animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ fü@@ ss@@ ler as a counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 is to come to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; therefore it is more likely to put on the TV series , such as its original labels , which is produced . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he became a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; lav@@ ender is reminded of of d@@ rought @-@ long conditions and due to diseases caused insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute &apos;s CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively threatening because the plant has brought the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has brought much less rain in spring , and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small goat , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ goat , and with very dri@@ er weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil cur@@ sions not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very qu@@ eri@@ ous for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and dec@@ eler@@ ation of tasting from the ground , but also the embro@@ ider@@ ies of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet , in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what to feel safer : they are supposed to take their children with the office , who were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or make them at home . &quot;
&quot; security professionals have three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ por@@ ter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal value . &quot;
&quot; there are Dru@@ aut@@ op@@ gler , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists , who are suspected to make a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no quiet break from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , are always more journalists . at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 have taken up his position after attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz and until now there was at least seven lo@@ aves in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist who wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs .
&quot; his absence will be deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two re@@ por@@ ter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear the smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ era . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ter discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 was established a Son@@ dri@@ al prosec@@ ution in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of kill@@ ings , each year with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed on court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ apped and even though the terrain is now in stock . &quot;
&quot; without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting with regard to the discussion of security is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , mi@@ str@@ ust all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed just to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was raised by two men . he was shot out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twelve &quot; river . &quot;
the fl@@ eman drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ours tend to be released in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the theme of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ acts last year and the delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ leg@@ ia of the country since ri@@ val@@ isi@@ tive fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t make it out that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day one or more people are shot on the street , or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of the two @-@ story mouse @-@ ole@@ ole@@ ans for drug k@@ ills that are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget about a minute , that there is a state of &apos; peace &apos; , if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of February , there was the publication of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el@@ ations in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ ly bought every copy of the output on , once they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ osk . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was in that Val@@ dez was unable to force , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived as long as he has survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
&quot; he was working as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he sold with five colleagues about the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 U.S. dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journalist without encounter the smoking problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and publicity . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved it to publish harsh investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else to treat . &quot;
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez has won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists from the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot;
he gave volunte@@ ered to him that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug @-@ trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in the past October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went ahead ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak @-@ bird , who was like a port worker , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar across from the office , and there always sit at the same table . &quot;
well ask them : was his love for routine his destruction ?
&quot; his death also comp@@ elled them to ask her own ass@@ umptions , how to do their work on the best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their fur@@ tive run@@ - and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
his own Inst@@ antly trust .
&quot; if it smells , abi@@ ding away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government offices . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space where the staff got from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to security training , there were suddenly no wr@@ ys allowed . days previously was known that Spy@@ ware sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; out there were two polic@@ emen examined in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
&quot; they were commissioned by the regional government , the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ first building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , which the governor themselves are not considered trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it has been months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de facto are under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has dri@@ lled on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the cou@@ l@@ ements that focused on the hom@@ etown of Govern@@ ors .
&quot; there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was command@@ ed when it was time to write , what each in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter made from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy player , which ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which dominated all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption for state @-@ of @-@ class corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ters to write over previous attacks in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man ent@@ ailed a military over@@ fall . &quot;
only a few months ago the readers had seen the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; sooner we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken through our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers who are dedicated against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ viewer Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez took a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western State of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is of it . &quot;
journalists all over the country have become more lou@@ der by re@@ written in organized protests of SOS Press .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez moved away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to sp@@ ying journalists and rel@@ easing them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since been asked for her that she was re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her wo@@ unds has in@@ ju@@ red their objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico have been organised by organised crime , participating in governmental organizations and an equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug users , but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Ar@@ tic@@ ulo &apos;@@ Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned over half of the attacks to journalists of police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you , because they want you to take the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the z@@ etas card : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer@@ ised and ear@@ phone rings next to their un@@ separated head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others do further as there El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo and the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 did .
2010 is the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly on the drug card with a Editorial page on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists have been flying out of their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will hun@@ ted , as it was evi@@ ated by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the flight from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that the drug trading is scar@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce started on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ ming up . &quot;
a series of shooting with tap@@ en@@ ri@@ v@@ als and security forces near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed .
the war continues to escal@@ ate how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the sub@@ folders they have released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ups he@@ ul@@ tes in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the polic@@ emen , who held the watch , to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they had no fear at all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , its mid@@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you even think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day , on the J@@ avier was murdered , the practic@@ ant asked me to send it to the coverage of the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue when a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Ber@@ gar@@ bei@@ ters were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even declare that its love skin was made by red@@ dish brown - and they said , she had something of a &apos; un@@ tranquil past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; turned him as &quot; the poss@@ essed din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs , which was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs species of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the circle of between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic is the pump@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater that best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to out of the surrounding rock out of plat@@ inum , and decided to look more accurately . &quot;
he discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ack@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ unds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished product is ready to be unvei@@ led . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes blin@@ z@@ eln you could almost believe it , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ack@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although he is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably threatened by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly pump@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is used as counter @-@ proof , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to blend themselves better in its surroundings and to do@@ dge his enemies , say that it is sugges@@ ting that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier did for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ ack@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli following the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists working patterns and form of shed and arm@@ ors about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ady , a widespread defensive method in the animal , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprisingly , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exce@@ eds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was forced out of enough pressure by meat fres@@ ging din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution is supporting the tear of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals who use the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or G@@ ür@@ g@@ ens - are much smaller and vulnerable as boot@@ y , which was sign@@ aled that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly pushed din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been to have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life , including his con@@ serving Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes in order to find out what it had eaten as the last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as South @-@ Eastern today , and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ aged skin , but it remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early rot@@ ary period .
&quot; you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you are just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the cra@@ yon time was a time when giant thermoplas@@ tics , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous Dinosau@@ rs , who stood on two legs on the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , became the pump@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs of some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose recent findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried after death in the sea and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ known din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it enth@@ r@@ aged two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops , that rag@@ ged from his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the pump@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters rus@@ hed through the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ding river floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater orientation of the din@@ osau@@ rs Dis@@ armament his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the Hau@@ tr@@ este still b@@ ump@@ ed b@@ ump@@ y plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a victory in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I met , the more confusing it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied removal of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right for@@ rest is on his side , his five fingers are fed up . &quot;
I can count the shoe at his sole .
in the storm : mass@@ enk@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass am@@ ar@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous last @-@ last but long @-@ term stun@@ ts - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) have been in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday morning at a mass @-@ Ar@@ bol@@ age about 20 people .
&quot; according to the first information of the police were between 17.00 between the junction of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ah @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ age of almost 30 vehicles , including even lor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; on the exact number of last figures , there are no information available at first . &quot;
&quot; it is about easy to intermediate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a great deal of emphasis on rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked towards Munich .
&quot; in Fahr@@ enheit , Munich formed an approximately ten kilometres long back@@ sli@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; like an AZ @-@ Repor@@ ter , there came also on the counter@@ way to massive disability through numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade occurred the marks of the vehicles , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , the second accident occurred in the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between a car sports and a truck .
a rescue @-@ helic@@ opter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in
it is a moment that has experienced almost every one time : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or she is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; comes the creator , and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ ett@@ ft or rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ed the driving force in the midst of the work@@ flow . &quot;
card @-@ control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German railways currently test@@ et the creator @-@ check @-@ control .
you simply confirm by phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
currently a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; if the offer comes to , we stretch it out . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; said a rail spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is called the train card de@@ valuation without creation . &quot;
&quot; to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to do an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you have to purchase it via the app of train , the DB Navigator software , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat @-@ reservation reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one climb@@ s in the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the test customers , a button on the electronic document will then be released . &quot;
the traction companion is given to their mobile devices a message that riding g@@ ast X has on the train and the requested seat Y has taken .
&quot; comes the traction companion in the box control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ less online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can go further , continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; check in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; anyone who wants to travel without a ticket control by our train stations , checked in the DB Navigator simple himself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the guests to shape their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB remote . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives us , know that besides delays and pas@@ sers , the card controls will be one of the biggest eras . &quot;
&quot; for many times , one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the fellow travellers do not all documents that one needs to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or a HR ID is missing or otherwise a document , which you have to indicate . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the endless discussions between mig@@ rat@@ ers and suspension , which leads to a bad mood in part or large space and delays in controlling your own tickets and takes care at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of Test@@ customers can use the new service .
and that also applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart Essen .
additional draw numbers on the same circuit are not yet activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken to their core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ ate on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the street &quot; , &quot; it meant there . &quot;
&quot; confused as anyone else had posted on their Fe@@ ed the information , she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per of the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns @-@ loose body that was cli@@ cked on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; I figured Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who had claimed a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live fe@@ ed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , escap@@ ed another polic@@ eman his ri@@ fle and cried saying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; remembered Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot;
this is not the way of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
in that moment I felt embarrass@@ ed .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cin@@ emas on the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the viewpoint of men who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , went on the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you recall , as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; reminded it about what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
she needs to know and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; although I have the luck to give her a experience , in which she had not experienced a bl@@ at@@ ant racism then she is not unlike the next black female child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when it arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was to a camp , when the activists was waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there was Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags ahead and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly a new way of activ@@ ism began to embrace Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed upon the 9th of August , &quot; she said and notice that she was appointed as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; weeks later I met Fer@@ rel@@ l during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to document the &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of it ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites , in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for his activ@@ ism around fat@@ alities . &quot;
his dedication brought up Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after the black@@ ish shooting .
this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talk to us . we talk &apos; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are shown , because I will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to focus on Ferr@@ an experience - to show that it is not about a Messi@@ ah leader , but the community that comes together , &quot; &quot; says Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ er &apos;s lives , as she loves himself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in the wor@@ ding of black people .
in addition Ferr@@ er &apos;s history repeated the role of black @-@ gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as s@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women need to wear the main last of everything . &quot;
to realize that &quot; the movement really hold of black women and many black women .
&quot; it is however that this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as a heart of film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person that arose this energy , she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the front front because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on are long gone , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police pers@@ ist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is gran@@ ting for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway to a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which they call their home : &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they cl@@ oned to a singing and she feels obliged to do this in mind , since they left three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the streets . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves people , although it is far from being built . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ east of the pedestrian zone was spl@@ its since the first presentation , 2009 the population in supporters and opponents . &quot;
cold leaves the subject hardly .
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; the topic will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; the one to the bit can say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) , or &quot; This would be real class &quot; ( Nicole swing ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ placement ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; during the pro@@ pon@@ ents that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the rest of businesses benef@@ itting , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be positioned right on the property , on which the peasant market hall stands in which 13 directors market its products . &quot;
at the beginning of the construction work will be the conclusion .
&quot; the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all in the new construction - namely , with a possibility to get out there . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the house@@ wives are always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s party we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would wish , even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct imports in a market hall in the gallery will appear on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this is likely not likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping does in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ones or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many stores stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that we have at least preserved the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly directly from producers and is very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , stores stores in a bunch of larger companies are reserved only by larger companies , because the corrupt Mi@@ eten are often not portable to a ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special stores are almost no longer and what still exists , will then probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ Change : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the peasant market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually going on at some point .
or does it manage to sell all shops of Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; a Shopping Center , that is empty , also needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market hall it is thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ nig many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ compar@@ ably identical - that hang out of the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were sent by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ pers and Haar@@ ons which you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the extracts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former sec@@ recy analy@@ st was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she was considered a secret diplomatic messages about the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
&quot; the new exhibition which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A matching similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was re@@ unification in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and dismis@@ sal disp@@ en@@ ation , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama has been transformed when he was only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extrac@@ ted by the algorithms of DNA , which was extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing and made out of the 30 portraits , such as a little intellectual comment not only the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been open to the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of es@@ pi@@ on@@ es@@ etz , computer research and theft . &quot;
&quot; with the prison its image was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only a single picture - a gr@@ acious , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is clearly uncomfortable at a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum bu@@ ck carries - with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ Project &apos; stran@@ ger &apos; .
in it the artist &apos;s portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ e@@ facts like a cigarette mu@@ te and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um that extracts the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a pas@@ time azin .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time , and she could not photograph them , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and their det@@ ain@@ ees were to un@@ equal glasses , which have been carried out several letters in the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; it was created even one of the Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; who would be a future prior to the president of Chel@@ an Jud@@ gment and she was able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually only published a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military coup in K@@ ans@@ as was first found . &quot;
&quot; there are now also at the opening of the exhibition something new low , and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump will lead a war against inform@@ ants from government camps and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ ez@@ ers , which he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things arise from a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery the written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its super@@ large sub@@ ordin@@ ance among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the automatic frag@@ mentation , their foundation gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ro@@ lean of Cs and GS , and As , written in pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoff@@ tes , by integrating the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) show how amazing similarly , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring , is that our gen@@ ome is not about taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , that &apos;s why the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as it emerg@@ es with a free phone in the hand of the discipline of the United States as King @-@ Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they put your speech , they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never ever the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she has written to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet personally - just as it should be looked forward in the Com@@ ic@@ buch , but when they are doing it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where its genetic o@@ il@@ log@@ groups were written with pen@@ cil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portrait . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to be like a mass movement , which form@@ ates itself with Chelsea , such as the movement which also hidden behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for kill@@ ings .
&quot; a national life hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , which was chosen as susp@@ ects , after a man had been caught in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ rant for murder of their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the Cook County .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one by the police authority of Chicago , Community war@@ nings , that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the ground of what is dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them@@ self has been a professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that La@@ them had now been ruled out in an e @-@ mail declaration , and may be excluded from the run of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is a criminal issue that is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom in contact and ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities any way . &quot;
&quot; the statement was added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked , and wish that he presented himself . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to place the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of place , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities can help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip given that in apartment 10@@ 08 something had happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by safety cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Management team of Grand Plaza released an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice , and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ plan in the near future - the Russian Vi@@ cep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Vi@@ cep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap has been updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to meet the Code , which describes the criteria for the recovery of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list are noted that the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the reported outcome of the W@@ ada approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ funded D@@ op@@ ings in Russian Sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation since our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has developed an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ual &apos;s words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in the course of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als of the W@@ ada of the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the Haupt@@ qu@@ arti@@ ers of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA moved &quot; to the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete with your staff the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the poll@@ s did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers don &apos;t mo@@ urn the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is on the w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee commitment , it allows companies to perform surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups to address employees anonym@@ ity and complaint Hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n allows to address the C @-@ Suite managers and apply directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , Co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software @-@ Analytics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think , and won in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat @-@ card of the company that shows how units have most ail@@ ments and which leaders have low popularity results - so that you can down@@ turn , why . &quot;
&quot; companies are to see that at the top of the workplace culture you need to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next u@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , which describes a former employee of har@@ vest@@ ments , in which those who have spoken to have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups as G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , after the financial technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent real behaviour and recognize , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alle in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; poll@@ s to collect sensitive responses in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the staff to report a real behavior .
&quot; and if the main office is involved , complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or beh@@ aves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumers and boy@@ cott , workers @-@ Flu@@ or@@ tu@@ ation and Kl@@ agen , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the central office , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems , the previously of managers who were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ denti@@ als practic@@ - faster and are addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can draw closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company began , ethics , values and staff engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron @-@ sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as service , and loads the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model , and a chance that is the approval of Venture Capital investors , which both have supported start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as S@@ app@@ hire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has been raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; glad@@ ys won $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are barely surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture Capital . &quot;
there is an increasing complex of research which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more and more jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bet@@ s .
the people want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you can give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work you do is profitable to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ di@@ tions when their portfolio run well . businesses run well if employees are working and engaged .
&quot; when the Analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
data on staff involvement is important to the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company has asked employees after your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if change comes quickly enough , or not at all , this can be found in dis@@ appointments and instruc@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen them too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees will ask you , &quot; have you really heard ? &quot;
do you take care of that ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , which now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to take action at the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so saving . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to organize a newly @-@ decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch , which is well @-@ known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose clients . &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ises
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their sing@@ ular parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training system .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are logged in to the summer curve are returning to their final test , before they return to the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m. to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ v@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players , and it has extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three workouts of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedu@@ les of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood is moved to the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in western wood .
they are supposed to ab@@ ort in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 prior to the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point of routes to the player . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous loading three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have simply pushed it , she plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we arrive until Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , resulting in the clear advantage of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been planted with a door@@ way , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then adapt it to an exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise it is quite a good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 . &quot;
&quot; we will do the best , with what we have . &quot;
I am not very worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with bel@@ lows to be transmitted by third parties and their findings under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts , so called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website that is starting with the use of updated ped@@ als learning methods , to identify possible mis@@ carriage and to send them to fac@@ sim@@ ile , that might show results of the fac@@ sim@@ ile of the original articles . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the major plans for so called F@@ ake news , many of which believe it will also have influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe whereby the French elec@@ torate were floo@@ ded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan to eliminate social media networks such as before the elections in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate Declaration to German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of the new facts check . &quot;
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories are challenged by fac@@ sim@@ ile of third parties , the people want to make sure decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product manag@@ erin for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; associated article &quot; and working on other changes to his messages to reduce false news .
creating a com@@ ic end : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a not@@ ch for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 and 1980 @-@ years .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced a thousand years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat in the ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and now is now inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead since 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who illustrated in Scot@@ ney - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the th@@ umb @-@ pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ ag@@ enten in the 1700 &apos;s , he says for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his th@@ umb ! &quot;
&quot; and letters still cre@@ ep to smoke , because back then one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be too . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who struck with old pap@@ al that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have exagger@@ ated my welcome &quot; &quot; ) , this seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the palace , such as the mon@@ tured gre@@ gate @-@ heads of walls and bottles , which had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ed , gardening , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only received full access until 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when we arrived a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years ago in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; sli@@ des@@ hows , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps , who ate what poss@@ essed : &quot; you could mean that country con@@ stru@@ cts boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , leave it all his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to sp@@ read@@ ed on a broader basis in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer &apos;s name of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; knee Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
the farmers started in this area and I thought a revol@@ t is a good beginning .
perhaps the two are linked together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ iten@@ pat@@ ers that hidden the history of Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented in the 18th century who filled his own funeral with stones ( a discovery that was first excav@@ ated until his coff@@ in was du@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ fur is Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , and again and spend money on things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men extingu@@ ishes their debt crises , married by rich old women - I imagine them as a p@@ ile well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote compassion . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his commitment in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique Wr@@ ite experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind the early 20th century , which has been back again from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the contrac@@ eption of the 301 year old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef was launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof mar@@ ke ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; still until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &apos; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( natural ! ) not really , &quot; write them on her yesterday &apos;s website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make plain , that man@@ ches is better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as a bad honey citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action it goes to more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says furthermore . &quot;
&quot; it is applicable to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive solo performance . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; a moderate five @-@ digit amount , the city of Bad Honnef keeps its new roof mar@@ ke and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year in the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) via oscill@@ ations and respon@@ dents in the officer or@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
&quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces , a year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of Staff , as formerly , but in the Prime Minister of Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; at the presidency of the government , the presidency of the government is now also the five pillars of Acc@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers . &quot;
these were civilians in the Y@@ as in the transi@@ tions .
the government moves the r@@ eins to the military .
&quot; President Hul@@ us@@ i Ac@@ ar remains in office but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the aviation industry and the nav@@ y were canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; since the President Cou@@ p has led President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire pul@@ ler of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt has been negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had referred the overthrow as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he will give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
&quot; in late February the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hürriyet &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; discomfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general strike there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifes@@ ts amongst others in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the Grand @-@ rein@@ statement by the army and the security forces goes on .
in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 cou@@ tries he mo@@ urn , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan the military forces .
the gener@@ als in former earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times by calling upon their role as a guar@@ dian of the mund@@ ane state .
&quot; following his election in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s power has pushed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform@@ ists of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted by the Ar@@ med Forces of the Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; the Turkish army was looking for asylum from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be held in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; meets this , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the Allianz after the inf@@ ant doubts is doubts about the support of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; say non @-@ diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks ahead , lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for the loss of vis@@ as for a short @-@ term working permit and restrictions on families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is set to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do so by changing the US the way people from other countries . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will make the candidates good that speak English , which have the financial means to assist themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Saarland wants to connect to track
over the past few months I have suffered over the future of the racing climb sh@@ utt@@ les - now it is said to go quite quickly .
&quot; before the end of the year , at the mar@@ oon circuit , on which the tourist trail continues to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the future of the racing car for the long term , according to the information of the Ministry of Defence , shall begin this year construction work on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision , the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g is further to order and san@@ itation , the country is committed to this particular interest &quot; , &quot; stated public state secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of the over@@ hau@@ ling of the route is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country gets 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country , I am not currently tuned , stated . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as an employer may agree on the technical details .
&quot; this means the timetable to the used vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for eleven years .
so that the racing rigi@@ d shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the racing rigi@@ d shuttle is one of the most popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; during the past months , during the course of a pilot training , the circuit has been used by sufficient many people to order them in the future . &quot;
the track is also strong in parts heavily .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it may not be still crazy , a new report comes across the technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robots from the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ous professor for Rob@@ otik and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the ey@@ e@@ color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le , and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; people make up about it funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see it much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex@@ pu@@ ffs developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin which are warm to touch - with consciously human reactions , which are achieved by the artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also custom@@ ize its robot according to his con@@ vic@@ tions , &quot; and here you can select from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but there will be even more disturbing , as many robots would possess the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would be a Step@@ ford female progressive . &quot;
modern Sex@@ pu@@ s have become robots with a si@@ lic@@ on skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to the properties that they find appealing , as for example . &quot;
and then there are still the names of the True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of students and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot;
&quot; like they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed , or it can be &quot; &quot; in the mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties that suits on rape , if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( says here : res@@ ett@@ led ) Far@@ rah goes , be@@ un@@ quiet one on most . &quot;
on his site ver@@ tically True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; says it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex game . &quot;
&quot; their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation point towards something dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture , to retreat from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course keep no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R hold its increasing popularity , they remain still provisional at the edge of consumption culture . &quot;
&quot; but what sc@@ oo@@ zes out of the edge @-@ zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or bel@@ low until they give the free market to their permission .
&quot; there are nevertheless a certain over@@ cuts that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has ge@@ aring women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the dev@@ out body and the stolen eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with porno@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; your tors want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the motion of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not constitute any real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or a background history , nothing , what on independence or anything hin@@ ted , which could inter@@ fere with fantasy total submission . &quot;
differently expressed : they are f@@ ake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ umps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the concept of healthy life
&quot; it has become a bon@@ ding of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. voters , even families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to interact with the horror of Tr@@ ump extrac@@ ting relatives . &quot;
we rigor@@ ously cover all of us to bur@@ st our filter @-@ gases .
&quot; less noticed is the Power of Tr@@ umps , families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist @-@ oriented poet , who lived in Chicago and has long been visiting with the republi@@ cans in our family , spent me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that the unity of a united enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everybody knows she knows , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely peculi@@ ar on the same page . &quot;
&quot; to the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also brings significant risks to it . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that we will no longer meet his m@@ ould one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a scar@@ ed long @-@ time scenario , in the tr@@ ump republi@@ cans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear to be suddenly compared to its standards as a means of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays by an active no@@ stalgia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s novel@@ ty , the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach who saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact , a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump walks , the nearest Candi@@ date of Republi@@ cans must only be spirit@@ ually healthy in order to qualify as un@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the wal@@ nut of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are kn@@ ur@@ red and the animals are tw@@ ined to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music conv@@ eys this in a strange manner . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a great roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a wei@@ rd experience , as here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old , and two women can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee @-@ house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option , the rating with a 15 % drinking fee equal - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slower exchange , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ eed@@ ingly exc@@ eed@@ ingly gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I tired the experience to get my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ o@@ us with ni@@ p@@ ache from the prison to the hospital
&quot; Pist@@ o@@ us , for the second time , Pist@@ o@@ us has left the prison for a hospital . &quot;
&quot; last year he was transferred to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts to his hand , which he suffered the j@@ ailer authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
guns was sentenced to an appeal to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors to an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors to an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he k@@ icking Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by placing her several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia on it .
&quot; Pist@@ o@@ us maintained that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly p@@ aving , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of guns from which they say they are too si@@ ghted .
&quot; the national prosec@@ ution bodies said that it will be raised in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ o@@ us is liable that his sentence is increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold can find a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the flower schools , the quarters of the wat@@ ering sler were released from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and into the further leading schools . &quot;
three of the de@@ duc@@ ers go to the high school in the future - four at the Real@@ school .
&quot; assistant Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental , in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol for school@@ ing we chose the 29 pup@@ il of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ le , who grows up in the chicken yard , but nevertheless the freedom is being released . &quot;
&quot; for this , the m@@ all@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold was a remarkable egg , and he sent it from his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken ch@@ ick a small eag@@ le came out .
&quot; but the hope to make a chicken from him , he sm@@ elled , the eag@@ le moved up his wings on a high hill . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken . &quot;
they danced with the young Go@@ cking the cylinder to the w@@ ager .
the Adler stand for the integration , said graduation Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other kitt@@ ens ( chic@@ ks ) , but they were included . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wanted each quarter of the cl@@ as@@ y that he feels in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who repeatedly jump into classes , and the parent leaders . &quot;
the chic@@ ken@@ time is now over and explained a teacher Sophia Schum@@ acher .
&quot; they leave their pupils after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the bor@@ eh@@ äs@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
it bur@@ st great joy among the children .

software update for diesel cars : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel driver need to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; in the diesel @-@ top BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the gas @-@ behavior of cars of emissions classes 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from them .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe returns the ass@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents :
is the new promotion be compul@@ sory ?
&quot; no , the tr@@ aded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory update before apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ acher software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has formally ordered the Kraft@@ form ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a generous implementation in the coming months , but has not yet been called any exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has communicated to each person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection is required , this will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long are the moving equipment lead to ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , we voluntarily act the car manufacturers on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long does the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could last in the workshop only three to four hours .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the A@@ ce is for the wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would retreat so s@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where suspension is dro@@ wned . &quot;
in rural areas there has been no value of value for older diesel until now .

the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize @-@ giving ceremony , President Tr@@ ump promises to become political . &quot;
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards by the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the Cultural Revolution announced on Thursday , a singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be handed over to the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and compete together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the progressive TV series , LE@@ AR announced that it has already announced on participation in the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - to them even the means - and that deb@@ ited me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make their view clear@@ er . &quot;
&quot; after the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; among the former prize @-@ makers include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we are making the city worth living .
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ master , goes to pensions in the coming year . &quot;
the site is already written - suitable applicants are r@@ ar .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ master is present .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conv@@ eys in the Press prize .
&quot; he reports of diversi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , I wondered that so far no application for the application profile . &quot;
the city looks for the next time an architect or an engineer .
so - under consideration of regular periods of dismis@@ sal - still enough time for an elabor@@ ation .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach has been fun@@ er@@ ted for the administration of the Sub@@ stitu@@ tions , must be responsible for the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; would it not be able to fill out these , would have to go through citizens for consultation until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but civil @-@ proximity be the city and it itself is important , W@@ acker says that of a good working environment , as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; over 30 years in office , some major projects have been collected , look back to the cr@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city vibrant , he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : re@@ designing the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ parking place for instance . &quot;
&quot; the ven@@ ties between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stage @-@ restoration is still the subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike with about 1.5 million euros by be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all wait great tasks to my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
pet@@ ent@@ age is for a city master of great scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener it can react fairly flexible .
&quot; you can move a lot , so W@@ acker and the design of the green@@ houses will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the Old Town is considered as an ensemble under monument protection , be it important to have an eye for what it fits , when re @-@ building are approved , the com@@ mander of the bau@@ master . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries a high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; at the end everything is going out over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has existed for ten years since ten years . &quot;
&quot; even that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes , &quot; We are looking for someone who truly want to be identified and stay with the site . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to be@@ aker Roland W@@ acker should be responsible for information about the city of Has@@ l@@ ach as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor &apos;s degree and expertise in the fields of construction and building planning .
&quot; the Municip@@ al Office are high @-@ quality and deep @-@ made , construction planning , sub@@ ordin@@ ated subjects , management of urban tourism , urban work@@ flow with building yard and city of building , including for@@ age protection authorities , including for@@ age protection . &quot;
bike on lines : south @-@ lane locked
&quot; according to police , the far @-@ known crimin@@ als had thrown the blue bike from the railway line in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ per street ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ b@@ ah@@ ende spre@@ aders had to be raised .
the investig@@ ators are going out of two male tat@@ toos and search for them since the night hours .
near the tat@@ too were witnesses of a pink @-@ sco@@ oter and a bicycle @-@ driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ t , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the perpetrators brought themselves into great danger and also threat@@ ens the traction .
&quot; in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delay drive and the costs of rail replacement , you could also find P@@ ön@@ alen to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; overall , he said of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ side track could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly 10 persons of Person@@ alities were Friday afternoon , two of which concerned the distance of correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight extracts have not been removed , but they were del@@ ayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to switch approximately 200 metres above .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( infl@@ amed bo@@ wel disease ) to lin@@ ders &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory medicines . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1,3 million and in the UK of 30@@ 0.000 , causes con@@ spic@@ uous , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the parties normally get to avoid meat and dairy products that researchers found their symptoms , found researchers at the Washing@@ toner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins that contributes to the toler@@ ant intestinal cells . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the bo@@ wel to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to dis@@ solve inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in anti @-@ inflammatory performers . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was established that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ isation in mice occurs , which carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ators . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the elements of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich food toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal lining , when the same system also wir@@ es to people . &quot;
&quot; the doc@@ torate of Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ on analysed a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance , when she found out that a group of re@@ ws such cells had , but another group of the same tribe , but that was not accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the cer@@ ers of mice , DNA @-@ sequ@@ encing and it were found six bacterial species , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them l@@ acked with the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they have not developed a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om , and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria continued to grow the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abolic disorder that is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us have been tru@@ thful to our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tractors . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ adren@@ al products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i , the cells in humans develop as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory performers . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ us can lead to a expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius &quot; has committed &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday starts , and impressive in the nec@@ kl@@ ace , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; MAT@@ IC however was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ation Asia @-@ Tour of the Blues and only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was agreed that he had to improve before the Premier League &apos;s Premier League . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later be ready .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho will be the start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent announces that in this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes three further orders , but insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; three of his four priority performance . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ car manufacturer Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky painted .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington ab , the drawing began but in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a continuous test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising earlier .
&quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new free@@ zing for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind was turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel , nor SPD head was , looked at the Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; just no stur@@ geon of the party central , just no return from the covenant - so the most important wish of the electoral fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz the party has changed , the fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from the Willy Brandt @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus has been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed national capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with the return in the approach . &quot;
there were low @-@ hits .
and one after the other .
the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a generative signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red green can simply not be reliably regi@@ stering , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editors of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tional loss of a Green Party has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the presidential election lost his red @-@ green coalition with its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner urged the tr@@ aver@@ aging Green @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to give their mandate to their mandate .
the crossing to the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ et must immediately give its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal leader and election of the Gre@@ ens of the Red@@ corporate Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; si@@ ghs an SPD electoral campaign@@ ers , than on Friday afternoon the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ay@@ ers reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is opposed to the crossing of the Green Members El@@ ke T@@ az to the CD@@ U without their own registr@@ ars . &quot;
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD @-@ state associations .
and no one knows what is coming next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , calm down the comrades of the comrades time . &quot;
after the Land@@ tag@@ ary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia will be everything differently .
that was how it became - and everything was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel was brought to the SPD to the Tum@@ bling , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te Haute Party of the Party . &quot;
&quot; and te@@ di@@ ous , the comrades in the weeks will come back again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just exhausted their courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next fall .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD district , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned down . &quot;
and because he did so much wrong in crisis communication after that what to do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW and its role in the Supervisory Board the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Prime Minister had been argu@@ ed since a longer time in the cri@@ tique .
mi@@ ese con@@ duction was added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because Wei@@ l has always been trying to get stronger in the federal government in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the pursuit of the former civil &apos;s of Hannover , his power in Berlin , has also not remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him when they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
this applies to Wei@@ l on the cross @-@ party internal purpose of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in essence no debt .
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades strive to hold their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and in particular on the ab@@ sin@@ ess of parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the party left in the SPD Bundestag , the Red@@ corporate Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets is not responsible for her person as a direct partner , but over the country &apos;s country &apos;s country list , the Dutch representative will continue . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they have returned their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD member states , lam@@ ents a &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : the people have Stephan Wei@@ l to Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische SPD as a leading candidate in the German Bundestag , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career of future CD@@ U MEPs , the W@@ ah@@ ler &apos;s result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
requested the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or has given it further promises of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
conveyor belts of the village III
&quot; who wants to be gentle in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; above , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg &apos;s development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again been looking for a review of the events so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sensitive refurb@@ ishment areas .
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the conveyor belt . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 , the grants was at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous mark@@ ings are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is important to promote the inner development , not only new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , there will be the information given by the Prime Minister for Karlsruhe , that there will be a re@@ organisation III . &quot;
&quot; the total amount is called 833 Euro , of which 500 000 euros of the land , the rest of the community received . &quot;
now how is a re@@ organisation ?
&quot; you will find as Sch@@ in@@ dler further , examine where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field of interest , to san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional borders can then also be postponed . &quot;
the St@@ eg agreed on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose frame the mark@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; at the core of the program , the re@@ vit@@ alization of domestic cities , enhancing the living conditions and work conditions and maintenance of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , which is called per plot . &quot;
the re@@ development area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 , 30 April 2026 . &quot;
&quot; even until September this year , however , the inventory was only taken to fill out a questionn@@ aire to fill out a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional character shall take place in the coming year with the mark@@ ings in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every Comm@@ une have carried out the said pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; it is about to evaluate the urban @-@ planning cont@@ actors , and decide when gentle and to what extent . &quot;
for the particular property there will be a re@@ organisation in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back again and received a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; in which it is among other things about the construction and refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and Wohnungs@@ bogen , &quot; you may be directed to size , division and residents of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; bow &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , it is noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a fill questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , new building measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler emphasized that the distribution of funding after the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , ex@@ hor@@ ted first . &quot;
&quot; you can reserve any support for later &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Locations II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to come with a hand@@ wheel in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish invent@@ or is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open up his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand@@ wheel . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between th@@ umbs and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aesthe@@ tist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant method is carried out by medical standards . &quot;
technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company from North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the adver@@ t of the White House cost the tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event , which costs American production in the last month , costs tax@@ payers to the indications of the military that have been entru@@ sted to the T@@ IME Magazin . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter was issued in addition to a yacht with Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House required the presence of helic@@ opter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary Order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter at the South La@@ wn , according to the records of Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter met at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event around 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was cleared on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that when the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the limitation of the hours a second team for the flight flight would be needed . &quot;
the original aircraft was during the event during the helic@@ opter while the security personnel remained in the ground during the time on the plane .
&quot; from the records of the T@@ IME provided , it was not clear whether the second flight was needed . &quot;
H@@ atch Act provides federal state to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could inj@@ ure the determination .
&quot; one question we asked , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , rep@@ lied the dep@@ uty command . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was known as official event by the White House and were not covered by H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a impetus for reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts for the insulation of the government &apos;s regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; but to request their use only for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February as the Pres@@ idential plane before the background of his first campaign appearances in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Pres@@ idential plane . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty chief Secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations perform frequently training trips in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by cutting the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timeters .
&quot; as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was introduced in the White House 58 &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs for the month , said an official . &quot;
helic@@ opter units also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support .
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ payers have been presented to none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in providing the helic@@ op@@ ters at the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 under@@ scores a budget for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to st@@ und@@ ries of the U.S. Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D discount for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
&quot; records of the unit record the flying time of the aircraft , 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia . &quot;
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; to determine the costs of tax@@ payers on the basis of estimates for fix@@ tures , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden cost , which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the expenses for DO@@ D will not contain the personnel expenses , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state is very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; it is of course appropriate , to highlight the benefits . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ed with the helic@@ opter , when he bet@@ s his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire@@ cars . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
top @-@ top of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga occurs at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ sburg Su@@ ess@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will perform tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ sburg Su@@ ess@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite after five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance , the leaders of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has preserved the sense of reality . &quot;
team Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has at least respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which is always played in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially in the rear positions , I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV on all the imports from the high north .
&quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to st@@ akes in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this will be hard for us .
you also need a good serving luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the Trip to the North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; even at the Chall@@ enger @-@ tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella ( Czech Republic ) , it is not possible to join the Bundes@@ liga team at the moment in the tournament in Č@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the so far Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white rus@@ sian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski on the ball in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he was supposed to be in Kiel but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories on the last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could put back into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was in January 2016 the number one of the Jun@@ iors of the World Cup , not filling someone from the train@@ ee at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ res . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he sat on Wednesday evening his signature under the law of tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his h@@ ast , the law adopted , &quot; I packed Congress a few &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels b@@ elled against the US crash . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft looks to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , the investors in the domestic O@@ MV are co @-@ financed with other European companies and the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea ( Nord Stream 2 ) . &quot;
the threats is tremendous .
&quot; nonetheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring down the sanctions against executive order to live . &quot;
twelve weapons are at their disposal .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; has been viewed , which the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really be w@@ asted . &quot;

roll back : the city represents 46 kitchen help .
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is turned back .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld is taking over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , vice @-@ president in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; we all felt very happy . &quot;
cooked is still cooked out except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh@@ ly cooled .
&quot; the city operates in the area of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 getting children for lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children with the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; by now we eat not only children , the 45 hours @-@ hours are looked after , called &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is valid also in the 35 @-@ hour support , when children till 14 o &apos;clock remain . &quot;
&quot; 46 sub @-@ time employees will be warm up the angel@@ ed dishes , supplement them to salad , raw and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal individually , give the food out , clean and clean@@ se the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ groups as well as the seventh facilities - decide on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly assigned to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus they are much more involved , and it is easier for the con@@ fes@@ sion to implement educational concepts . &quot;
that is why it is about healthy nutrition and cooking .
the children will help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the chef &apos;s team is as useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a familiar force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the aci@@ di@@ fication of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen @-@ forces - will be done in the future by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , even the charm that it turned out in the cost @-@ comparison between peculi@@ arity and stran@@ gers to the city as the most economical , it says from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 sub @-@ time employees will be re @-@ employed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educ@@ ative area not so strongly into the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , am@@ elled head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are held by the council elections in the provinces . three women are run for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be real and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to prepare themselves in managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to manufacture in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company formed the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which presents to other products hobby and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; when their operations would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns , that funding for the moderni@@ zation of production lines has not been prop@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , concerns our members deeply . &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus heavily on local community and large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising life costs and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production for Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ei@@ ter at T@@ oll@@ us@@ Cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly since we value our ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB @-@ representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , with some questions openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we deb@@ ated with the employees that we work like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate , our business is continuously checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operative improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full of attention . should we change our operations on site , the employees and their trade union representatives should be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ns three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga is interested in her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not tax@@ ed in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having sent an offer of £ 189 million to rede@@ em his release pi@@ vot@@ al , but have warned that Barcelona has been warned of three years before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the trans@@ fer@@ ment window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after ending N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out outside , although a source has always been close to the Catal@@ ans Board that the club has always his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but has the football world been warned of three years ago by the PS@@ G Pres@@ idents in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as a Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact her player , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have passed this line , whereby the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer is interested in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that it would not be able to leave the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; because he arrived a car on his driving lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ted the Leit@@ plan@@ ke . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW against 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the town@@ ship of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger on its driving can meet him , so that he had to do@@ dge to the right . &quot;
tou@@ ted the Tour@@ an drivers the Leit@@ plan@@ ke .
in the passenger there was no harm .
&quot; the driver of the opposite cars , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it may be good for the accident that the ced@@ ony drivers had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( report @-@ poll@@ et Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse cases un@@ poll@@ et Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion of discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ ub , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; We are the Church &quot; , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral @-@ grand@@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their own false evaluation of processes . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; however cri@@ tici@@ zed that in reporting about violence in cross @-@ cats with &quot; double measurement &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody knows that it must be pun@@ ished for &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; react , but the &quot; degree medi@@ al Mani@@ pulation &quot; , &quot; thus the &quot; Grad @-@ Fu@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histori@@ an and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of describe the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the everyday life and prepar@@ es the public opinion on keeping it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; one likes to go on to the church , and this is a bad fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; was a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; to be with friends , as I was one was ready to cope . &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards on previous decades because the world has changed .
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse cases , the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often applied . &quot;
&quot; totally w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly , author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who has written the re@@ membran@@ ce &apos; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says E@@ zek@@ emann , &quot; For all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that which was commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the Ap@@ pear@@ ance Ulrich Weber Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high consistency , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in conclusion , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially high emotion@@ ality , the punishment of the pupils could also be dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other def@@ endants ref@@ uted that many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity from R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
in an interview explains Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion is un@@ poll@@ uted . &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non @-@ violence against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; is a contradic@@ tory image by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one lift many students in his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tioning , which was tangible , when a baby @-@ cat doesn &apos;t put a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his Bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you are reading the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was found at all in it . &quot;
he is currently devoted to eight sides and he is clearly spoken of any suspic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or co @-@ knowledge of the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the non @-@ violence in the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its importance . &quot;
&quot; you can throw him all , one too late or have not taken the first hint to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ inal gymn@@ as@@ school , in which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent testim@@ onial , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; understand@@ ably , &quot; &quot; super@@ fic@@ ti@@ fied &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about perfection and its high quality of Emoti@@ ons which has also led to wo@@ unds .
&quot; that he did not only thre@@ w them with chairs , and thre@@ w the keys and bo@@ died on the ground , but also washed and too nau@@ ghty guys to the hair or ears , he has already existed before years ago , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it exc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honor &quot; salvation has to be said however , that such educ@@ ators in the fragile period , the 1960s and 1970s , have been widely used , in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding @-@ methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the ble@@ able sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , are the free Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
you are wondering if there is no more to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do so many media just dropped upon him .
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood it , still ei@@ fri@@ ction . &quot;
the truth is : the report un@@ poll@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in connection with the report , the report has been very much reported on the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also laid out any de@@ composition or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael E@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ gri@@ ps claims to have become familiar to the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I have never get@@ down myself to speak with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; said a subject of subject to the others , &quot; It was very embarrassing for me . &quot;
the real problem in solving sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims would be silent .
&quot; if they do not even communicate their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators of a professional , yet to have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a survey students formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he used ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the offen@@ ders .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that a bub@@ bles in@@ tru@@ er or more clearly or more clearly , than compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; that he trusted himself in advance of the students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as if sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to acqu@@ itted by any fellow @-@ knowledge . &quot;
&quot; so , it cannot be cast before him , not prevent or have taken it to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media was a lot of &quot; non @-@ violent &quot; with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be dis@@ car@@ ded in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge king of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , and somewhere , in the midst of the George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but that is , in turn , is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there is clean divided : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asium of the cathedral cats , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the report is dealt with inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir conductors . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which Kn@@ g of s@@ adi@@ sti@@ les , regul@@ ates and mal@@ ign@@ ed , un@@ covered , un@@ event@@ ful at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states need to be err@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first to face than they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ inal gymn@@ as@@ school . &quot;
&quot; on that way , as most witnesses stress the theme of &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ inal gymn@@ as@@ school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was no discipline , but there is no s@@ nat@@ al violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims might have the general humanity from R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; so , most of the accus@@ ation remains to have gone down . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods when he was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the happ@@ en@@ ings at a school where he didn &apos;t want to hear and be responsible , ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
high wear Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymn@@ asi@@ ums , which the report is even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out this , that in the preliminary school the exam@@ inations continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; already in the face of the danger of negative Pres@@ sever@@ ity , he recommended urgent initi@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity was existed , as exam@@ ple@@ ated in Bavaria too long . &quot;
&quot; before , it occurred in a legal gray area , just as each one of us has probably white . &quot;
&quot; there was difficult to estimate for him , where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted limit was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can not say , he would have always been away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ iner to schools were officially completed in Bavaria too .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is unfair to apply the present ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to the past &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but that is of course not true for sexual abuse that was ab@@ om@@ able at all times , and also not for what happened in the pres@@ ent@@ ment of ad@@ versity and violence against un@@ trained kinder@@ gart@@ ens , this goes far beyond the times of exercising . &quot;
this is all quite terrible and I am glad that it is finally en@@ acted .
&quot; but at the same time , I must accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his instrument for discipl@@ ining and b@@ ying , so ear @-@ hor@@ ses@@ sive and ear to the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical radi@@ ance then it was forbidden , he kept strictly in mind . &quot;
which picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Zeit has returned Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
came the subject of exam@@ inations also in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book about the life of his brother Joseph , the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , says from his perspective , there the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I had no means at all that he led to a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this has to be said : without this perfec@@ ti@@ tious discipline , without the calling un@@ related discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of world tran@@ sp@@ ans , true cultural rich@@ es of Europe and his musical tradition which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no great singer and standing before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
as what kind of person have you experienced since Georg R@@ atz@@ inger experiences during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I learned Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was really good to know and over again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , strong , faithful and warm people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could not do something like a fly . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly coming up regularly , like many former domains still today , 23 years after its em@@ eri@@ zing , regular contact with him , visit him - he is almost blind - and him to treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cross @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and has offered them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respectable person , to which she is still looking for a look and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you thro@@ ws it , are educ@@ ators who were at the order then . &quot;
we can be glad that we have already overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , only because he has promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; that is the evil intention , that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , un@@ poll@@ uted it . &quot;
&quot; now the stand @-@ areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without anyone outside of Bavaria , and perhaps in Germany no one would be able to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
