<seg id="7">"that knows everyone, who had to rain himself already, because the auto-Navi took place in a green meadow instead of a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State government, are anything but current - but that is why it is very inspiring."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when they compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then it becomes apparent how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bavaria atlas is a splattered canvas, which one does not recognize as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great postcard we have worked for cities and villages for detailed maps, so-called Urpositional blades."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were created according to the Bavarian surveyed administration, between 1810 and 1864 and disposed of the first survey of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders had been occupied with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if French troops served with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours that created the idea of a surface-covered Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph brought the project forward, founded the" topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian corruption management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others found on the website of the Bavarian state library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruits / Today is at the example of the state capital of the former capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was used 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in the Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, subsendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings focus at 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: while Hindu ooms appears a small piece of map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten plaques from the so called" "Uruptake" "which was derived from the property tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not occupy the world today no farmers - but small-ärtner of the plant "land in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is characterised by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 exhibits of the October 19th century, was actually a meadow - and no concrete form in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map provides an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the district of the present district Au-Haidhausen is not only read the street name "at Gasteig" or from the hill "On the ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, you once get people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt" "at the Auer Lüch."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - that psychiatrist, brought to the death of King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time, and ended for example the Ankets of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he is also permitted to use the personnel to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had first place first, later on 500 seats were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalks in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar Amber-Amper-Klint is located in Munich since 2006, one of the largest psychiatriates of Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt can now meet young people in the Münchner Salesianum.</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil rights group released Reisewarning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national union to promote colored groups has issued a warning for colored people who travel on the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the State to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which aims to come into force until 28 August 2017, call for afro American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questioning, checkout incidents in recent times throughout the state and here be remarked," it says in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it heavier to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution bodies of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have breaches of citizens' rights to happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are raised because of their skin colour, they are merged or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such an frequency which we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist associations against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after while travelling by the state was no gasoline, and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Office Office of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be more common than women."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be prepared if they bring money-money or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 Hassverges in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassverbrew reporting program of FBI, which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri-Law, which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACES) Destinations for Texas and Arizona, published after the States immigration authorities, committed to violate local prosecution bodies, as regards opinion of the ACES to further Racial proclamation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travelling openings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but at the last time, stakeholders have implemented the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Envisibly project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen Weiresaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Paraglider Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given himself a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabenhof of the Piotmann family, representatives of the hereditary CDU locals met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann gave initially insights into his business, in which he hosts 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest crops, 40 milk kitchen and as many kittens provided and housed in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black-milk" "is for him the alternate marketer marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the case of BLHV-chairman of the fisherman, he marked the forencroft project as" elementary "." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep plots.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area prepares for a lot of work, much mts with the engine-sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even though he does not carry bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the restrained project, and is pleased with the leader of the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare would have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">"we hope that the forestation of the areas could still be moved out for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue to operate in their operation," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the closing area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half of the leader was promoted to the village of fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus we loved the farmer 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of women."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and housewives."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White, there was best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscsplled Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of women's fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Schwarzwald's.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the LPR marked.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the inconsistent area may not be slowed (Hangout over 35 percent) and must be threatened by upforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"in 2018 it runs the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure of 35 hectares, the kalkulisted costs are at more than 112 thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest sign of a regime change, it is when they begin to attack the statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate these as much as any other - hence, a carefull fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic thrust in a hitous dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President of the drastic immigration of the statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Boatlandowners and liberty-Imitators could have made him a ynchronous when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their importance, and in particular the importance that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer later was added later and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct properly, but as he formulating it itself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the shook words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your poor, your poor, / your beaks masses, who want to see, free to breathe, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time, in which the" miserable waste "was better on our screen."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself not in literary criticism - he clearly made that people are not welcome in Trumps in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who agreed to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well, that they accomplished a highly political act."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by showing the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is even another name: mother of the exhilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people want to move from right wing this long for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the decay for the advent of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one-conservative, but rather an early Neoconservative daily who is bringing the American flame into the umented world:" lady Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It aims to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something engraved.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it, to see them as they were seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships was seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people, finding refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speak to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not supposed to enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black lowed shottish Members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two villi were belonging to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the capacity of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member states will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish Athlets was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland has developed something special" and the Athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it. "</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we figure it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish Athlets are medals there, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which was elected against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the crew to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their surrender speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were chottish or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh completely natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of Silver Medal, which will compete in their fifth world Championships with the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "is that 16 villi are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best totals at the World Championship has been seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">The midstream muir leads on this path and has five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 metres rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another scalloy that one should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first World Championship, when the only different shot in Team Lee McConnell was. "</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of their landlady will not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thanks to his team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was anyway a great honor to know, but to know that my team mates voted for me and have chosen me, making it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here established as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise on poedies."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this way home support and benefit from it, that we are again at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be as a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics concerning Facebook: don't get a public office if you do not tolerate the lizen of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers smote him because of all to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shaded in the critique, secure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we shall be guided as the sheep to the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to governor of Larry Hogan, who must work to be more than Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Stab of the Governor did the complaint as frighol, and the online comment was full of a return trip with" "Na, and?." "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-highest consent of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very pleased to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hauness head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of individuals who come to the Governor of Governors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by workers who are paid by public tax Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hoelia spokesperson Amelia Amelia spokesman the acts of Governor and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of Trolles or spammers or hassertive people who resonate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no Troll."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his mail and appalled to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawyerstin Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked to break after hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassverbreak and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the "" Send "" The Post. "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people are taking place on the same subject, then they are regarded by some rather than a so-called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected people."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governor was signed as" "concentrated Spam-attack", "would other probably be" intercede "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to convert a message by simply blocked a critics or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in past times when one had done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical cords, and to burn or to burn protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that he criticized Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump will be blocked by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County has last the First Amendment, according to U.S. District of James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they named a voter of their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Prein received a visit to ACES because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable PORTOS had a similar effect as the internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous stamp smote to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyme such as Juricola," "Belisarius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" "wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washington's decisions made."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed its position, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought her to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, opinion and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne has unpacked their bags and has sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something, which was similar to my prize."</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with her and made a quote on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit the 1,000 square meters has been completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally, one-room estate with a wasted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage room and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose they instructed the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to release the prevention.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelworks is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arranged, that they were overthrown, without giving us a gaps."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but put it in steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled it Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of common drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic coupling window by Retrouvius down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver bulding and vintage Serge Mouille illuminations put the style for the program. "</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>

<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the reflection of a window feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance they mirrored units space for all the eyebrows and glasses of joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room may include the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>

<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a cloakroom.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering, went in," explains Erfan of the reinforced MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is essential so it, if you move the door, very slightly gliding."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the cleverly use of space and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and a improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate brokers will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they made it to enlarge the floor area and use high quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and hence help create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not adore you into the electrical socket, in the walls."</seg>

<seg id="1484">"U.S. secret services accused the Kremlin for a long time, specifically into the presidential election in 2016."</seg>

<seg id="1486">"at the focus of investigations, several men are to stand, who acted in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to it, Mueller also took more and more trumps in private and business environment under the magnifying glass."</seg>

<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the replacement of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President was used on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>

<seg id="1680">"the case seems to put a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon-oxidation in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carrier's text enigsaw that she has encouraged him to end his life."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet, in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what to feel safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office, who were the target of an attack with granulates, or make them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security professionals have three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal value."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are Druautopgler, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to make a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no quiet break from violence, and throughout the country the corpses, are always more journalists. at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 have taken up his position after attacks and threats under Bundesschutz and until now there was at least seven loaves in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist who wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows its middle finger with the word" Justice. "two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear the smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamera."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 was established a Sondrial prosecution in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of killings, each year with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed on court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrapped and even though the terrain is now in stock."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting with regard to the discussion of security is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, mistrust all of us."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed just to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was shot out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" twelve "river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The fleman drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to be released in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the theme of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans reacts last year and the delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegia of the country since rivalisitive factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't make it out that in Sinaloa every day one or more people are shot on the street, or that the graveyard is full of the two-story mouse-oleoleans for drug kills that are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget about a minute, that there is a state of 'peace', if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of February, there was the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartelations in war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the sons, suspected gangly bought every copy of the output on, once they were delivered to newspaper kiosk."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was in that Valdez was unable to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived as long as he has survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was working as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he sold with five colleagues about the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalist without encounter the smoking problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and publicity."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez has won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists from the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave volunteered to him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug-trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in the past October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what went ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaak-bird, who was like a port worker, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar across from the office, and there always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well ask them: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also compelled them to ask her own assumptions, how to do their work on the best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their furtive run- and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own Instantly trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells, abiding away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no more - as not as in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government offices."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the staff got from Riodoce to security training, there were suddenly no wrys allowed. days previously was known that Spyware sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"out there were two policemen examined in front of the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">"they were commissioned by the regional government, the offices of Riodoce in a four-first building in a mid-class neighbourhood of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, which the governor themselves are not considered trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs de facto are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has drilled on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the coulements that focused on the hometown of Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the prosecutor's office, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was commanded when it was time to write, what each in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter made from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy player, which ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which dominated all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of corruption for state-of-class corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporters to write over previous attacks in this restaurant, including one where a son of" El Chapo "Guzman entailed a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago the readers had seen the columne of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"sooner we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El Flaco "" because of its slim body statur. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken through our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers who are dedicated against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reviewer Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western State of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is of it."</seg>

<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez moved away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spying journalists and releasing them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since been asked for her that she was re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her wounds has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico have been organised by organised crime, participating in governmental organizations and an equal society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug users, but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>

<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to out of the surrounding rock out of platinum, and decided to look more accurately."</seg>

<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished product is ready to be unveiled."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're just a little with the eyes blinzeln you could almost believe it," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrackl Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although he is covered with armor and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly pumped dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is used as counter-proof, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to blend themselves better in its surroundings and to dodge his enemies, say that it is suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier did for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrackl Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markchelli following the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists working patterns and form of shed and armors about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shady, a widespread defensive method in the animal, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shady shady is common, the results are surprisingly, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was forced out of enough pressure by meat fresging dinosaurs, that evolution is supporting the tear of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals who use the shady shady - think of deer, zebras or Gürgens - are much smaller and vulnerable as booty, which was signaled that this nodosaurier was subjected to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly pushed dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs-carnivores have been to have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life, including his conserving Darminhaltes in order to find out what it had eaten as the last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South-Eastern today, and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurs is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preservaged skin, but it remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early rotary period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you are just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the crayon time was a time when giant thermoplastics, carnivorous Dinosaurs, who stood on two legs on the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, became the pumped dinosaurs of some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose recent findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was buried after death in the sea and in mud."</seg>

<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-known dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>

<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis Gebate on the bed of an airbnb-apartment, which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and there is still on the street", "it meant there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as anyone else had posted on their Feed the information, she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper of the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns-loose body that was clicked on the street and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," I figured Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who had claimed a sign with the wording:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, escaped another policeman his rifle and cried saying," I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," remembered Ferrell to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the way of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she fetched her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in the cinemas on the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the viewpoint of men who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a suitable crown, according to Ferguson, went on the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you recall, as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" reminded it about what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">She needs to know and see it and be reared in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"although I have the luck to give her a experience, in which she had not experienced a blatant racism then she is not unlike the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was to a camp, when the activists was waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there was Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags ahead and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new way of activism began to embrace Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed upon the 9th of August," she said and notice that she was appointed as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all fulfilled. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later I met Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document the "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"one question came Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for his activism around fatalities."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His dedication brought up Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after the blackish shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talk to us. we talk 'said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are shown, because I will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to focus on Ferran experience - to show that it is not about a Messiah leader, but the community that comes together," "says Folayan - she turned out to be the open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets show "surprising personal aspects of Ferrer's lives, as she loves himself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability at this work and in the wording of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition Ferrer's history repeated the role of black-gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as sul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women need to wear the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">To realize that "the movement really hold of black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is however that this is not a affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was chosen as a heart of film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person that arose this energy, she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the front front because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police persist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is granting for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway to a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which they call their home:" "a chaos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they cloned to a singing and she feels obliged to do this in mind, since they left three years ago in Ferguson on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Siwahn": TV-reader discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves people, although it is far from being built."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south-east of the pedestrian zone was splits since the first presentation, 2009 the population in supporters and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "the topic will be discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"the one to the bit can say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker), or" This would be real class "(Nicole swing), comes from the other side:" "does not need a man" "(Siggi Bplacement) or quite simply:" "Siwahn!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"during the proponents that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the rest of businesses benefitting, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian zone bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be positioned right on the property, on which the peasant market hall stands in which 13 directors market its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-Macher want to integrate a markethall in the new construction - namely, with a possibility to get out there."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the housewives are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's party we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would wish, even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct imports in a market hall in the gallery will appear on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is likely not likely to be low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping does in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drones or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many stores stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that we have at least preserved the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly directly from producers and is very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, stores stores in a bunch of larger companies are reserved only by larger companies, because the corrupt Mieten are often not portable to a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special stores are almost no longer and what still exists, will then probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf FChange: "a mall with a Markthalle does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where is the peasant market hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery is actually going on at some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it manage to sell all shops of Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"a Shopping Center, that is empty, also needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall it is thanks to the wahnsinnig many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can see - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparably identical - that hang out of the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were sent by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and Haarons which you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the extracts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secrecy analyst was a 35-year prison sentence after she was considered a secret diplomatic messages about the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was reunification in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and dismissal dispenation, whose condemnation of Barack Obama has been transformed when he was only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithms of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and made out of the 30 portraits, such as a little intellectual comment not only the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been open to the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of espionesetz, computer research and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"with the prison its image was suppressed, so much that there was only a single picture - a gracious, black-white selfie, in which Manning is clearly uncomfortable at a driver's seat and a platinum buck carries - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was straight from the great success of their 2012-Project 'stranger'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it the artist's portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts like a cigarette mute and chewing gum that extracts the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a pastime azin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time, and she could not photograph them, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and their detainees were to unequal glasses, which have been carried out several letters in the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"it was created even one of the Shoili Canungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "who would be a future prior to the president of Chelan Judgment and she was able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually only published a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military coup in Kansas was first found."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there are now also at the opening of the exhibition something new low, and Starkes, as Donald Trump will lead a war against informants from government camps and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweezers, which he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things arise from a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery the written artistic statement called Manning with its superlarge subordinance among them (the" "i" "in their family name is provided with a heart) an end to the automatic fragmentation, their foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandrolean of Cs and GS, and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hofftes, by integrating the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) show how amazing similarly, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring, is that our genome is not about taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, that's why the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as it emerges with a free phone in the hand of the discipline of the United States as King-Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they put your speech, they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never ever the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she has written to me," "said the artist, who greet from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - just as it should be looked forward in the Comicbuch, but when they are doing it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulation."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" "2, Manning Statur), where its genetic oilloggroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," "Dewey-Hagborg from the portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to be like a mass movement, which formates itself with Chelsea, such as the movement which also hidden behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a national life hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, which was chosen as suspects, after a man had been caught in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury."</seg>

<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) report a report on the development of sex robots from the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emerious professor for Robotik and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eyecolor of the robot, its shape of nipple, and the type of fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make up about it funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see it much more frequently," "Mr Sharkey said at the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuffs developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin which are warm to touch - with consciously human reactions, which are achieved by the artificial intelligence. "</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also customize its robot according to his convictions," and here you can select from the eye-color of the robot to the type or color of his fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there will be even more disturbing, as many robots would possess the" personalities, "which would be a Stepford female progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpus have become robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its users to the properties that they find appealing, as for example."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are still the names of the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah" which gives the impression of students and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"like they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed, or it can be" "in the mood!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties that suits on rape, if one goes a step on Frigid (says here: resettled) Farrah goes, beunquiet one on most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site vertically True Companion Roxxxy with a vibration but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then do not have Roxxxy?" says it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex game."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origin and increasing sophistication point towards something darker and deeper understanding in our culture, to retreat from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course keep no sex robot, and while the FRR hold its increasing popularity, they remain still provisional at the edge of consumption culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what scoozes out of the edge-zones, can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or bellow until they give the free market to their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there are nevertheless a certain overcuts that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has gearing women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the devout body and the stolen eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"your tors want them to feel human, that they imitate the motion of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not constitute any real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory medicines."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1,3 million and in the UK of 300.000, causes conspicuous, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the parties normally get to avoid meat and dairy products that researchers found their symptoms, found researchers at the Washingtoner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that contributes to the tolerant intestinal cells."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the bowel to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to dissolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in anti-inflammatory performers."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was established that a kind of tolerance-promoting immunisation in mice occurs, which carry out a certain bacterium in its initiators."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the elements of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan rich food tolerant, less inflamed intestinal lining, when the same system also wires to people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the doctorate of Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragon analysed a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance, when she found out that a group of rews such cells had, but another group of the same tribe, but that was not accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbial of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the cerers of mice, DNA-sequencing and it were found six bacterial species, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them lacked with the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in an sterilous environment so that they have not developed a intestinal microbiom, and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria continued to grow the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan-metabolic disorder that is known as an idol-3."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptopical values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us have been truthful to our gastrointestinal tractors."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-adrenal products from L. reuteri, the cells in humans develop as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory performers."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases unpollet Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnub, spokesman of the reform movement" "We are the Church", "explained by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral-grandmaster Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year's brother of Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their own false evaluation of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"in contrast, the Vatican" Osservatore Romano "however criticized that in reporting about violence in cross-cats with" double measurement "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the grips in Regensburg, nobody knows that it must be punished for" shameful and shameful acts "react, but the" degree medial Manipulation "," thus the "Grad-Fuetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the everyday life and prepares the public opinion on keeping it for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "one likes to go on to the church, and this is a bad fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth," "was a very normal educational means" "to be with friends, as I was one was ready to cope."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards on previous decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse cases, the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger was often applied."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who has written the remembrance 'My brother of the Pope" "My brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Ezekemann, "For all this had nothing to do with him," "he adds the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that which was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Appearance Ulrich Weber Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high consistency, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in conclusion, that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially high emotionality, the punishment of the pupils could also be disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants refuted that many victims underestimated the general humanity from R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview explains Hesemann, why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion is unpolluted. "</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of non-violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" "is a contradictory image by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one lift many students in his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other he also appears as a choleriker and perfectioning, which was tangible, when a baby-cat doesn't put a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his Biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you are reading the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself the name Georg Ratzinger was found at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is currently devoted to eight sides and he is clearly spoken of any suspicion of the mid- or co-knowledge of the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the non-violence in the pre-school occurred outside of its importance."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can throw him all, one too late or have not taken the first hint to be taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspinal gymnasschool, in which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - as literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent testimonial," "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "sincere", "and" "understandably," "superfictified", "and" "and" "grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about perfection and its high quality of Emotions which has also led to wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only threw them with chairs, and threw the keys and bodied on the ground, but also washed and too naughty guys to the hair or ears, he has already existed before years ago, deeply regret and excused for it excused."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honor" salvation has to be said however, that such educators in the fragile period, the 1960s and 1970s, have been widely used, in parents like with teachers. "</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the bleable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, are the free Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">You are wondering if there is no more to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do so many media just dropped upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood it, still eifriction."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report unpollet Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the report has been very much reported on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also laid out any decomposition or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Eemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual overgrips claims to have become familiar to the cathedral-kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never getdown myself to speak with my father or mother to talk about it," said a subject of subject to the others, "It was very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in solving sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims would be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even communicate their parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators of a professional, yet to have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a survey students formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he used (Georg Ratzinger) timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that a bubbles intruer or more clearly or more clearly, than compared to their parents, dormitory, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "that he trusted himself in advance of the students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as if sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to acquitted by any fellow-knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"so, it cannot be cast before him, not prevent or have taken it to be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was a lot of "non-violent" with the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be discarded in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge king of sexual abuse and non-violence, and somewhere, in the midst of the George Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but that is, in turn, is a misuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is clean divided: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral cats, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"moreover, the report is dealt with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductors."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which Kng of sadistiles, regulates and maligned, uncovered, uneventful at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states need to be erratic."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys first to face than they were already on the Domspinal gymnasschool."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that way, as most witnesses stress the theme of" "Vorschule" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspinal gymnasschool?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was no discipline, but there is no snatal violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims might have the general humanity from R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, most of the accusation remains to have gone down."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods when he was reported from the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the happenings at a school where he didn't want to hear and be responsible, (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">High wear Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymnasiums, which the report is even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out this, that in the preliminary school the examinations continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the face of the danger of negative Presseverity, he recommended urgent initiations."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity was existed, as exampleated in Bavaria too long."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it occurred in a legal gray area, just as each one of us has probably white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was difficult to estimate for him, where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can not say, he would have always been away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examiner to schools were officially completed in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply the present pedagogical standards at the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "pitfalls of Anachronism", "thus the danger to the past's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but that is of course not true for sexual abuse that was abomable at all times, and also not for what happened in the presentment of adversity and violence against untrained kindergartens, this goes far beyond the times of exercising."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite terrible and I am glad that it is finally enacted.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must accept Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his instrument for disciplining and bying, so ear-horsessive and ear to the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical radiance then it was forbidden, he kept strictly in mind."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his Regensburger Zeit has returned Georg Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of examinations also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book about the life of his brother Joseph, the Pope Benedict XVI, says from his perspective, there the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I had no means at all that he led to a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this has to be said: without this perfectitious discipline, without the calling unrelated discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of world transpans, true cultural riches of Europe and his musical tradition which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, one makes no great singer and standing before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of person have you experienced since Georg Ratzinger experiences during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I learned Georg Ratzinger was really good to know and over again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, strong, faithful and warm people, from which one can't imagine that he could not do something like a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly coming up regularly, like many former domains still today, 23 years after its emerizing, regular contact with him, visit him - he is almost blind - and him to treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cross-cats are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and has offered them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, väterous teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which she is still looking for a look and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything you throws it, are educators who were at the order then."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have already overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, only because he has prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoats."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"that is the evil intention, that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, unpolluted it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand-areas would have acquired a 93-year man who has acquired great merits and without anyone outside of Bavaria, and perhaps in Germany no one would be able to know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
