Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put into drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I am always plu@@ gged into drawers , or I am glu@@ ed from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are rather s@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she declared in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; at the lovely , the actress spends her time at home , vor@@ m TV with loose Dut@@ ch@@ - and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white gl@@ ut , they spend the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love Is Not Child &apos;s Play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single @-@ educ@@ ative mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Spor@@ tp@@ Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses reminded of their holiday , they said in fast Gal@@ op@@ p to the feeding . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I am afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and with it the horse @-@ arri@@ ere ended up again already .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament trip - back close to horses .
he caused himself to lead himself with his family about the facility of the AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t try to photograph himself .
&quot; for a long time , it was the first time in Aachen , and with it to CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was thoroughly convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe exceeded the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala pyramid .
&quot; at awards , it does not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ kreu@@ z , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has sacrific@@ ed him .
a long one of the 18th prize winners of the Spor@@ tp@@ Pyram@@ id .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only for spor@@ tive successes but also for social engagement . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been producing the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men the two @-@ times master &apos;s master was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; among the excellent belong the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ ff Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ ile , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ craft of Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports competitions have come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ates company went into the jumping stadi@@ on , where the lava prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ tons and truff@@ les in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and to prevent the TT@@ P trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; un@@ one , however , the two US presidential elections are in the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
the role of the role of the state .
&quot; stret@@ cher wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot;
Clinton w@@ ool to the economy of death and regul@@ ating death he says .
&quot; by contrast , he would be quite different , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return regul@@ ators , and he sets off strong tax reform with lower control systems - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the contrary , says : the state has certain duties to fulfil ; he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money for that . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in m@@ ts , Tr@@ ump and Clinton is almost wor@@ shipped . &quot;
the democratic elections announces itself the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nation@@ alization Te@@ ach@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , we could have another internal discussion . &quot;
clearly the differences in energy and climate policies are evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build power @-@ fired power plants and restore coal mining in the USA .
oil production is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas and will termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand its investment program explicitly and asks : &quot; &quot; a country will create the clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; TP@@ P , the tran@@ sp@@ aci@@ tive trade agreements , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US would not want to isol@@ ate the United States - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
they should also be paid for better than Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger dimin@@ ishing .
she wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must r@@ ump , then he says he could not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months might likely be likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics adhere to him , so that the budget deficit would only be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who want to demand at least by the rich , that they will pay more taxes , and their critics are saying : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
flight : &quot; every woman has gained experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who own alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
a has laid out her little son in the arms .
he sho@@ cked with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother goes on to the table @-@ top .
&quot; until they realize , that it is observed . &quot;
she sm@@ iled short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is an area of business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offerings in Bavaria , and among other things , deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
&quot; they live in Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and children in Bavaria . &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs@@ &apos; made the furniture together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Women &apos;s Aid .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who counts here , has made her flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope to return to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women they over@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ el@@ ls themselves secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see another way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sory , pat@@ ron@@ age , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; also here , women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered in@@ fer@@ ior and har@@ dest . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 percent of women who reside in the north in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not made voluntary . &quot;
many women were used to say that they are nothing to say .
&quot; or she does not dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they are often not going to help but need more accommodation only for them , ur@@ ges B@@ ahr . &quot;
the seven districts of refugees are responsible for the accommodation of refugees in Bavaria .
&quot; whether they knew about a similar project like Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ abi@@ ans alone , women are not separate alone , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ es@@ pre@@ ach of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken can be found in some areas of floors or own homes for all women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accomod@@ ated separated by men .
&quot; in a study , which was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are eliminated . &quot;
&quot; missing the privacy or become men and women together , it can come to - constantly - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women felt in need of this protection , it is possible to read the crowds at the end of the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has spoken around us , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily get a second home .
assistance investig@@ ators : demands for new jobs
&quot; dep@@ uty members of the assistance leaders have called up their union to rein@@ for@@ ge new jobs , with their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire advice , starting from the beginning of September more working measures . &quot;
J@@ DC said that ministers have failed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; Assi@@ sten@@ ologists and Medical students agreed in July over the rejection of a contract , which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC cub@@ its Mc@@ Court said that the government has remained silent &quot; to problems , which led to the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; it said , &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC Board has adapted to reject the proposed new contract , and requested the official New negotiations to all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the Schwei@@ gen of the Government , the J@@ DC committee today announced a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a running program of escal@@ ating work@@ flows , beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that assistance leaders in the year were six@@ teen , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Assi@@ sten@@ ologists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the decision to reject the agreed contract terms , which were advised by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , who were still involved prior to the vote by 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ sten@@ ologists and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt , that the Treaty of doctors in England would necessarily be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end of eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin made his Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receipt , I cannot conf@@ ess the expression that Ankara wants to seize this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the envel@@ ope , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile , narro@@ wed and he shining barely heat , even for his backward circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , he spoke to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis , but could even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day I described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so that would never be anything bad . &quot;
his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin @-@ radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was del@@ di@@ ated .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to put Russia into the back .
&quot; this was even bigger , since it was committed by a alleged friend . &quot;
&quot; the Vet@@ r@@ ust will rebuild it becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the nation@@ ally controlled media conducted a fierce attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed like the Turks would pay for everything to blame .
&quot; the most serious officials were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he disp@@ uted this veh@@ em@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting only took place because Putin was Erdo@@ gan on the ap@@ ology who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a c@@ eas@@ e@@ fire lie clearly on hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan takes first and foremost all the friends who can get after the last month at a weak@@ ened state of almost his ministry .
repeti@@ tive terrorist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him well .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - particularly pro@@ hibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
you count on a late ais@@ le of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week pre@@ diction the state tel@@ esc@@ ope , cheap fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian has been allowed again to be allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulating it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it was in response to the tried of power @-@ over as weak response .
&quot; to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll get on the worm &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke insi@@ sts out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian state head won in Ankara with certainty for a bonus that he sought after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ founded for Moscow , a matter of course , which even changed a deep @-@ se@@ ated fear of reg@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this bright Palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one of how it was once descri@@ bing me an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that have fallen out of the West and poorly dealt with . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest differentiation is Syria , where Moscow has recently been the role as a peace of peace , but where Russia and Turkey support . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks were told at the press conference , that they could not even engage the issue once more . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey rent it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to acc@@ entu@@ ate them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey cr@@ ush Turkey into the Russian fighter jet , it certainly is better that the two heads of state will stand at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is designed to be reduced to a back@@ office roll in the Bank of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were connected to the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since been stand@@ off@@ ish since eight years ago and it had to be saved .
&quot; during this time , brand str@@ at@@ egen have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other consumers brands . &quot;
they supported international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by up to the Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the Central headquarters and the stock market access to Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand as well as the brand , under which our employees will be busy , as we are now going to become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I am now saying that we do not pursue any global goals , but will pursue local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with the customers under these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that his six Nations sponsorship will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop themselves to the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on it inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; the lectur@@ er . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago , if we were told that we will be a great bank for our customers and had these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can turn these marks again , so I think the time has come . &quot;

Russia Putin hum@@ idi@@ zed Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has unexpected his Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special agent for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , there is that Putin arranged without giving reasons &quot; the dismis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered by his duties as the chairman of the Russian presidential system . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was de@@ part since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 in 1972 , he was born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he made his conclusion on the prestigious meeting of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it says ( in Russian ) that he later was later log @-@ chief and staff members of the governing council . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think that it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activity as the head of stat@@ utes and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared Russian TV stations on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked about to leave his job and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
to convince the smiling faces ?
this step has done Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as an stru@@ d@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men said that the St@@ ef joins his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - above all now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggles ?
this is currently no one .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man , who was once a potential President , who would like to direct Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks about Putin that are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov &quot; It is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , I could almost say - compl@@ ained about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been president of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was dep@@ uty prime minister and Minister of Defense . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , as Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) was assigned to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
as Putin in power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he was most familiar .
&quot; once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia in the second term of Russia , as a third term Putin had deser@@ ted to the constitution . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the northern deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four im@@ pregn@@ ation of the &quot; &quot; Deck@@ spl@@ its &quot; , &quot; which is getting closer to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , well as 46 sc@@ anned . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project shall be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Mr. Kei@@ th Brown takes place for a visit today and was one of the first , who went from the land to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer of a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel , which alone were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the tear between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge @-@ ende@@ ck a ser@@ k@@ le activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck is at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a bed shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first decision represents a significant milestone at every Br@@ ücken@@ project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the disclaimer are setting high @-@ quality and deep @-@ construction .
&quot; after installing the last street section and its connection with the northern deck , we had to conclude the still existing gap on the north or landing page . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge over 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tonnes weighs and when a slope of about 3 % had to be drag@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; un@@ cle , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works are tiny , on each side they buried only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat from angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI ambulance station took place on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had trouble swimming in security , while their boat moved on from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat filmed in her proximity and asked us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong win@@ ch have blo@@ wing the boat beyond their reach until we left the water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 , and were found at a Bo@@ je without life@@ jack@@ et . &quot;
they all arrived on board the coast and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men were cast into the water , were lucky un@@ ju@@ red and still alive . &quot;
&quot; although the boot engine had a p@@ stop@@ over , however , this holes can be super@@ vised by the person from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
hard hurt - man sti@@ lled on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Harb@@ urg with a knife and severely in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; as the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the cut @-@ out of alcohol @-@ stri@@ kers the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he twice came to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old were in@@ ju@@ red by the hand and the body .
the police could take the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this alar@@ ming result of his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore they went with their li@@ festyles out of the house .
on the street they met the ex @-@ li@@ ke@@ epers of the man .
&quot; when the two women got the apartment again , the ub@@ ar@@ est of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and hold his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds a budget @-@ priced apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and green of my : investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick to lose nearly 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; stand concept &quot; &quot; to the next R@@ ats@@ &apos; . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is lacking so far .
&quot; member presidents of Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be chosen as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market . &quot;
&quot; but the large strip of stri@@ pe in the city hall is , but as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how is one going to investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build such areas at least 10 per cent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new district of housing programme , which will cost millions of cost and has to be financed , is intended to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few as possible .
the left seeks even tough@@ ness for investors .
&quot; despite its , as Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely effective : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of further about 1300 apartments , whose support is going to run over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , so the plann@@ er spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we would have to be thought to return apartments back to the delivery . &quot;
this is possible in the Western city .
at one stroke will solve the problem .
because in the western city run for the end of the end Fri@@ sten .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of affordable housing there .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social housing in the western city has dras@@ tically increased dramatically , one depends on the goal of the so @-@ called mixing @-@ mixture . &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few city districts .
the Gre@@ ens count that there will still be movement in discussion .
&quot; presidents of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must take the CD@@ U into the boat . &quot;
this is concentrated on more construction sites for family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child to play out no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time with it , on screens , was converted to many lam@@ ents in the last decade . &quot;
Po@@ k@@ emon Go takes about to get people from the sofa and to be more active .
&quot; the time at the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were built on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later this includes a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest from the release of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand were slightly different . &quot;
the launch in other countries has been moved by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
&quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon go to more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players take their smartphone out and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are tr@@ acked with a GPS as soon as they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a Screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that leave the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch that followed 3@@ 5,000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of people pursued by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to the au@@ ction .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , who want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; take off &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active each day , because many public messages are boring to health and come to people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; those who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with the weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people join hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are m@@ ori@@ fic toys that always have to complain about something .
and yes someone could run against a door .
what is it to be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; if Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to push sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people to be hunting , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the swi@@ vel
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the imm@@ un .
dynam@@ ically at the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and finally the Olympi@@ asi@@ an .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the next title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; teams of A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ illen@@ ach@@ erin Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ tle in the Swedish clim@@ bers during the single @-@ contest of women in the arts demonstrations at the Olympic Summer in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ it is the fourth heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americ@@ anism , which wins a surplus @-@ title and overall the fifth , while she is bound up with their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; it broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey took an end to this moment . &quot;
this success is represented in the same League as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ it has dominated the last three years of its sport , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on , said that she is the best gymn@@ ast that I ever saw . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition which didn &apos;t get so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace the gold and silver in the single @-@ campus of women at the arts festivals in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , have won &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party of the retirement party , served in his retirement military @-@ ordin@@ ator , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a lock@@ able . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es consisted of it , during its long throw on the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its soil exercises - which include its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2013 there has been no longer @-@ table competition , a victori@@ ous series , which will keep as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina brought easily through two rot@@ ations , co@@ ed the picture . &quot;
sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord and Bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es the World title - lau@@ re .
they took up again at 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man hu@@ gged sof@@ tly as they expected their En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears currents on Bil@@ it gl@@ os@@ sy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision which they once did in their collecting , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she went to the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time had the 22 @-@ year team competition , called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil practice she bo@@ wed to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ ines , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that appeared sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as regards this , it has become a very new meaning of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : three victims in serial cover when listening in the car
&quot; according to police reporting that were published on Thursday two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl , who have been killed in one of the fatal attacks on Phoenix for a decade , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela La Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked , told the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a pur@@ ist weapon , while he rose on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ors , as the Att@@ acker did not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of an adult sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting , the investig@@ ators are giving , a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ischen living conditions were killed in nine months in nine ass@@ aul@@ ts and two others were in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , distributed Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to see the evidence , which they have led to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked , and were committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of her wo@@ unds and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
witness the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and to hear music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which decreased on an empty pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and from that , it was the work of the serial number . &quot;
&quot; An@@ w@@ ler found pat@@ ron@@ es , and insured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball@@ ast segments from the engine space . &quot;
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his retirement , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy knew nothing . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I managed not . &quot;
I managed not .
I did not let me last .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband told that Ed@@ mund can never realise her under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ears it to institutions .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a aid .
&quot; Ed@@ mund could not sit down up to his third year of life , and he still cannot speak . &quot;
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language which Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him string in , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical publisher -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ans or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the col@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an in@@ certain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they do not really know it really .
for a long time I had@@ n &apos;t asked for the progn@@ osis because I am not expecting that someone can really say me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful couns@@ el for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects that were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; in this way , it seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , divided police defen@@ cel@@ i@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;

&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl met by a cross @-@ room in the arm when she played in front of her house in the West of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police still seeks after a weak@@ ening .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie . &quot;
this is what I imagine playing on the women &apos;s Olympics in turn and for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three tur@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin @-@ color inspir@@ ational . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is , makes every proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it soli@@ di@@ fies the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as she anticipated , but master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ atic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday she was the fourth , heter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans who gained gold with an individual majority event for women . &quot;
Mann@@ es@@ co @-@ member of A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so they do not see Turn@@ classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the oly@@ mp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad is only four tur@@ ers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a costly sport and gymn@@ ast primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ ons which will be maintained by parents , for training , furniture - and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can continue as you like . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner you receive all the whole training and that is for the families a te@@ ures and long @-@ term commitment .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to get inspired to the congreg@@ ations of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ made and easy accessible rotation . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
&quot; with my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 people teenagers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ian ) , and national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who earn the opportunity to learn from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport .
&quot; exercising is strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for the school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the oly@@ mp@@ ic teams , and thanks , F@@ ass her as many young girls with different backgrounds motiv@@ ates your way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
Assi@@ sten@@ ologists want to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had h@@ off@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ ary of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 Assi@@ sten@@ ologists who voted upon him . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt plans revealed to introduce the contract in Brussels , and said that the N@@ HS would be detri@@ mental to a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance operators shall receive a new contract , which includes changes to night @-@ night and weekend work , in order to improve the care of early watch times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sten@@ ologists shared last night in a communication with : &quot; Assi@@ stance &quot; have serious concerns over the proposed contract , in particular that it will satisfy the current workforce crisis and to deal with all doctors just to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , still remaining until the first group of doctors have to fall under the new treaty , progress has to be made and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve disputes with the government to take part in the government for resistance and sometimes at o@@ de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it came to pass by a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt just made last month later , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now to lift up the condition and appeal to the concerns of assistance .
&quot; if he should not do this , so the assistance leaders have made it clear that they are ready to carry out more work@@ places . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a g@@ love of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as n@@ urses and specialists have been involved to give doctors at the strike . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to an acceptance of the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ ary of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to pay a better wake @-@ up payment for 54.@@ 000 Assi@@ sten@@ ologists , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS Employ@@ ee , called for assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working measures achieve nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only concerns , hard@@ ship and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ stance in Assi@@ stance and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively to concerns with regard to the tut@@ el@@ age and of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses and the gender @-@ specific wage f@@ ake in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

the regulatory authorities of the N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke will be caused by accumul@@ ations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the t@@ opp@@ ings break apart , it may cause a blood cl@@ ot that causes blood flow up to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ot is rede@@ emed , it can flow through the blood flow and con@@ flu@@ ence the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack at higher risk will have another risk .

&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the nice health @-@ technical evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively , in reducing other heart attack and stroke amongst people who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; due to a provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - primarily the blood risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the assignment is recommended no treatment that goes beyond this period of time .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness can be flour@@ ishing in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on exp@@ el of a government report for corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that widespread vot@@ ees in Muslim churches became ignor@@ ant like a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es sends the police , electoral observations and Rath@@ dwell@@ ings to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now a antagon@@ isms , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of elec@@ torate from religious motives would be so badly that the police should be allowed to set out poll@@ ut@@ ors outside of suff@@ r@@ ments to protect di@@ sill@@ usion@@ ment outside of them . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a row , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes before , not remot@@ ely ink to enter the finger of a person if they give their choices to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of not official comm@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only used against election , but is also the municipal Government before the wider corruption and financial revol@@ t culture that goes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Leg@@ nick@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special dial court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on was decided to corrupt to the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man could have per@@ for@@ ted the religious feelings of its Muslim community , &quot; and that he had brought his critics to silence with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the relative obligation of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , in which one person chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be no evidence on fraud across the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - in particular the older members of the Muslim Community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guides of aus@@ ages in order to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence was appropriate , that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the Elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ en@@ ic background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding Eth@@ nie and religion ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activ@@ ist brief@@ ing should be able to stop &quot; &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registr@@ ations in order to prevent the voting directory to immigration and social bet@@ ab@@ duc@@ tions . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before the election after your reference .
&quot; no distant ink on the finger of a person use , once she has given her voice to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic inspec@@ tions about the nationality of a person to perform in order to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on requests to an automatic letter .
ban that political activ@@ ist complete letter and envel@@ ope of sel@@ ections .
the police give the authority to set up im@@ parti@@ tions around the elec@@ oms .
a legislative change that an indic@@ t@@ ment due to inti@@ mid@@ ation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Gender Equality 1983 ) was facilit@@ ated .
photography offered in El@@ ms .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ tors ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees are usually able to enforce that elec@@ torate alone are in the voting cabins .
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no case have been filed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for the corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ stable , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for enrich@@ ing - according to the high requirements concerning the criminal proceedings , he ple@@ aded not guilty . &quot;
he also cri@@ tici@@ zed the most effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of the constitu@@ encies in the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is carrying out as the mother of the parli@@ aments a proud heritage , but the worrying and for@@ ged spread of electoral laws and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ i in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week over the French cyclists Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot over edge and band coming out to be impressive in the heart of the heart of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only way to pass gold cont@@ ended athletes , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you should believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ our@@ ing the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that resulted in time on our screen , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list to Olympi@@ astadi@@ um that have more than just a certain similarity with Dutch music . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood . &quot;
&quot; except for K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger in the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , there are many people on the internet to be like a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin Towers from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has a stur@@ dy on Twitter , after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the ins@@ anity of the social media with and gave to that he has been hearing since childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see great similarity , with the exception of the facial hair , shared Br@@ ady of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so let me probably do that well as ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly look at the center : the ongoing similarity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes shall be able to pass through its predecessor to the cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African bath@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one step higher : this user is that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another persistent comparison was pulled between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett has looked at similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ bound@@ ed skin and bl@@ on@@ den ha@@ irs as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d on while the American Nathan Adrian von fans was attacked .
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only ones : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy that others have also noticed any simil@@ arities .
theory : according to that user there is for the similarity of the couple perhaps one reason
&quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact the U.S. football @-@ star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
&quot; other popular ornam@@ ental Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal at Tur@@ nen Gab@@ on Douglas , who has her own wonderful , big smile , resem@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought , that his microphone is turned off , when he would like to finish his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ 0s . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was fet@@ ched into the comm@@ ent@@ atives of the C@@ BS &quot; to give more &quot; color , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year Chinese Signs has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; excited to be excited , went down like M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , wa@@ amm the second stage of the Flo@@ staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - laid seconds slower than Kan@@ adas Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the gap to visit China . &quot;
spect@@ ators in all Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were sho@@ cked by the tone and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter is in China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ?

&quot; the criticism against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many of the speech presented him . &quot;
Twitter &apos;s users did not go back as they heard how uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter @-@ User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;

&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We are sorry that the comment above has been aired . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy chosen form , sorry , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ised at the end of more than 90 times by the people who responded to the Real@@ ms about Twitter

C@@ BC copies and presents his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network exc@@ used also quickly and gave a communication .
&quot; we sincerely regret that these statements have been made , and that it was allowed to be broadcast . &quot;
we spent yesterday night quickly at our audi@@ ences on the programme and our follow @-@ ups in social media .
&quot; to clarify one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swimm@@ ing@@ in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were un@@ reasonable and a unhappy chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I did after the E@@ BC Olymp@@ us in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have taken care of the performance of the sons , and did not refer to them as a person . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ i@@ fied about woman who under@@ wear in the middle of business under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try to try out . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , mu@@ st@@ alled her , as it looked at it , she moved out and put them back to the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tasted four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who had at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she returned again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants out of the place , moved their own str@@ aps and p@@ ants , and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - it was just there , fre@@ ch as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each sti@@ le , when she pulled back the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously don &apos;t like , since they put it into a shelf . &quot;
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the same with three further under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that you fell nothing , re @-@ og and out . &quot;
she did not seem to b@@ other that they observed anyone - or think about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that had tried them .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How conf@@ ess to think that someone would have had a different person and had not washed out . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I joined , the employees tried to pull the garments from the sale after they left - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it , to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had landed and again and she had not washed away . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 of August in our branches in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from sales .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms .
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him a little more secure . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York , to find out how to desc@@ end with armed rob@@ bers at near removal . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you move back from behind , then you should turn out to be a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then strike it down with the knee into the body , and turn , while the Att@@ acker moves ahead of pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike it with the course into the face and move back , while they address the weapon upon him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers who are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously , shift the weight on the gun and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun from its handle before moving back and the weapon upon it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly as is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ op@@ ting .
&quot; but remember that it is at a smo@@ b at the safest way , your money is over @-@ rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ema for a guide to the narro@@ west places of Europe
an British empire sub@@ ordinate his immune system and saus@@ ages of a serious test - by bringing some of the narro@@ wer and ec@@ ar@@ est places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and Reise@@ p@@ tor Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scre@@ ened his course on the Pic@@ c@@ adi@@ l@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher at Pic@@ c@@ adi@@ l@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the res@@ ili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the abl@@ ation of each object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to get into . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , to reject the dishwasher , that has already been used by thousands of others , may actually be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually in a kitchen was@@ hes more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he read , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by the world traveled , and peculi@@ ar and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations , up to sink of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told him : &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and fl@@ amm@@ on water . &quot;
in the film he was justified to his reputation .
&quot; now , what he did , was a fil@@ thy public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its pro@@ pul@@ ling showed a l@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ isation of over 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ ometer is fresh@@ ly washed up less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies over 4000 units was , while fresh@@ ly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes to the worst , which I have mat@@ ured in a rest@@ room . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will not check here anything because it is here penet@@ r@@ ally .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish construction of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company stat@@ s Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us that contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ kov@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer a little new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through , which we ended , that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian call us . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how they are connected to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who introduced the film of the film , added : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian if he would have heard my respect for Ian if he had some of the things that I have dependent on him , just like the ek@@ el@@ dest Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring it to Ian and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we received some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in one of Vali@@ d conducted by 2015 associated 84 percent of all respon@@ dents , lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use , the U.@@ S @-@ acid bacteria included . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ an social @-@ apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social @-@ apartment after a delic@@ acy , with a damage to £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they have been removed from their property , sho@@ cked raising of the housing corporations found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls made cl@@ oned holes on , wooden thick , tr@@ aded , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family have been um@@ med and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation .
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is mountainous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had put the family , street struggles with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ots , drugs abuse , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams , str@@ ades and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was based on the lease agreement , was given an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old g@@ arbage was found . &quot;
&quot; they were tr@@ aded in the estate , in which past drugs were tr@@ aded , the wooden ri@@ mp@@ s . &quot;
&quot; neighbours told they that they are fighting on the streets , and where regularly the police had to be inv@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing Men@@ o@@ gi@@ o@@ gi@@ o@@ ed her and her partner this week by the estate , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to un@@ plug voluntarily . &quot;
&quot; the delay were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , saying that their lives were made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; she sho@@ cked at anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times we say the police , are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not usual !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it was administ@@ ered the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which was called by police in regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the town@@ house were tr@@ apped and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that it failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing take into consideration . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely and their deeds for their neighbours were aw@@ ful .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have gr@@ ac@@ eful to us and have made us the information we have done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development is con@@ sol@@ ation for some neighbours and the message im@@ part@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 . &quot;
a fil@@ thy mattress in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fting on the floor reg@@ ain .
workers of household management now have to grow t@@ egr@@ ams which surround the house
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ it@@ alia and cash in height of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a donation , once they had found himself guilty of the ownership of a drug class B in commercial view . &quot;
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee skel@@ don was born in 2013 in an automobile accident .
&quot; after having been without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were awarded gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will be ten@@ ants , who do not hold on to the house . &quot;
Angela C@@ row is divided by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not hold on to the house .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ alleg@@ ations , as well as those that were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour which continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; the leadership of the U.S. republi@@ cans will pl@@ agu@@ ed massive concerns , even in traditional conserv@@ atives states . &quot;
Pres@@ did@@ did@@ at Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire have expressed something like concerns , such as correspondence chess . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , now the doubts expressed his success in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump against evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame are false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his well @-@ known media again . &quot;
republi@@ can High @-@ Sh@@ ack@@ les
Utah normally is a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June to June , Tr@@ ump and his wife of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equality . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by far the distance , which are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered Tr@@ ump on the question , how he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
&quot; and whether back , this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he is doing nothing else , as &quot; the truth will tell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it does not mean for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , Tr@@ ump continued . &quot;
then I will return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ views , the Party of Tr@@ ump threat@@ ens to reach funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , one wants to take the candidates of Republi@@ cans for the Congress stronger among the arms . &quot;

she reminds with melanchol@@ y to her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;

the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany will anticip@@ ate hundreds of thousands of people seeking from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the middle term it could even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the exile Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh action of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after Putin , the Kur@@ dish community has expected to be a mass refuge to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ oned with ten thousand @-@ embr@@ aces from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fighting for minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President of the President of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already over@@ bur@@ dened by months ago , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey have been on the run . &quot;
after the put@@ ty put@@ sch would have more so@@ cul@@ ars and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
many will want to start new in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state who is taking on refugees in their own country , said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef said , the targeted settlement of Syrian Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities . &quot;
so that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exp@@ ul@@ sion to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled into the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k who is also CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef called for the Federal Government to become as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters .
also in Germany I find a &quot; Hex@@ e@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics .
I feel no more safe in Germany over the last few months .
the German branch of the man@@ ger movement feared also the escape of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany particularly Kurds and opposition .

&quot; as the newspaper mentioned under appeal on figures of the Federal Ministry of State , the Turks presented the largest group in Germany because of political persecution recognized asylum seek@@ ers in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus barely 29 per cent of all considered the asylum approved ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , not those can be found before war , poverty or unemployment . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by governmental side , individual persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go there , where it w@@ eh@@ doing &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia may not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid as far as far it is not : summer holidays , heat and Land@@ tag@@ sw@@ ings - which is sho@@ cked out . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country are on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so may not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; in addition , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters hanging , ballo@@ ons , flyer , and at the end of voices , only lab@@ elled trou@@ bles@@ ome . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election of the election and the last F@@ eri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass through the people at the beginning of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his position . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now located in Poll@@ s clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ ers , and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able remaining . &quot;
&quot; cel@@ ery , 66 years of age and since 2008 Government forces , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from its big cl@@ ut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributed ro@@ ses and chat a bit with the people , just as it did already his legendary @-@ car@@ er predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and is ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame on the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We do this , &quot; &quot; have stepped up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful position . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their top @-@ style data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ er , has experienced what it is when you make at the wrong time at the right place of campaign . &quot;
she held twice ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel on grandparents ; Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Pomer@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at the N@@ DR . &quot;
but nobody can listen to anyone from other corners of Germany once Angela Merkel to listen .
otherwise the North / CD@@ U is widely used on the usual choices on market@@ places and shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; that , as does co@@ ert , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordinate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the Union has reported that you penet@@ rate the basis on the ground , that it has to be very strict , to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are going on as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the hands of the country hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election to his co @-@ cont@@ actors are also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it w@@ eth , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because there is a lot in the game cel@@ ery has now called for a particularly dedicated campaign .
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats finally came to 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
at the election of 2011 the SPD was still clear with 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small parties with seven percent in the surveys , should create the leap into the land . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays in need of a modern virtue and put up their choices on the internet .
&quot; online election &quot; &quot; name is the governor of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green voting fighters move to search search for native stimulation under the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at from the Great Lakes and finds it also nice . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : speakers are suffering from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ constructed , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible in the building working at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end up against 20 o &apos;clock , there is always commen@@ dable praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything rather delicate , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff at the jet station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no move .
&quot; the job@@ site could be published on the weekend of the half @-@ time planning to the south , until the end of October is to be ready . &quot;
&quot; also , the object will also be praised for the workers who are responsible for the construction work , for example if it comes to setting up sub@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site went on Monday to the south and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has turned back into the town . &quot;
the people can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from B 27 to another .
the dis@@ integration through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; said the nomin@@ ee management of the Re@@ furb@@ ishment Vice President Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many locks were examined and more their Nav@@ i familiar than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to maneu@@ ver@@ itable trucks in the areas of living areas .
&quot; since also the speed limit was not observed , the assembly has strengthened the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself on site about the location . &quot;
two to three per minute have been caused .
the quick@@ est was with 77 km / hour at the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the job@@ site , it has been more quiet since the construction site has become more quiet . &quot;
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 there is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the street is open again .
they do not have to look into the maps of busin@@ ess@@ men .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to them for sales revenue , everyone is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even with aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no slight fall &quot; , &quot; but also a that of course , the drive is missing . &quot;
the places were most affected are the local places along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the teachers have hit it too hard . &quot;
&quot; l@@ acked the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen und Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; he rose to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the hau@@ l took its operation &quot; &quot; back to two years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to release them .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been dismis@@ sed , the policy would react differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt proposed on a request of g@@ öh@@ ner , whether there is a financial balance , the host @-@ house benef@@ ited otherwise from the advantages of location at the B 27 Now , they also have the dis@@ advantages that arise by the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such things have been dealt with .
&quot; for all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is certain that his hom@@ etown will continue to pass . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now taking a few times because of complicated traffic guidance , it can be understood . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot drive up , it is also quite different . &quot;
&quot; that its tri@@ bal cli@@ ent@@ el returned after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , there has no doubt on it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 @-@ building on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of the terrorist fight against laws .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a tome security package . &quot;
but what has a dump status with terror to do ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable , politically reasonable , &quot; said the Federal Minister of Interior concerning the presentation of his new security policy . &quot;
and they call for anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also participate .
&quot; but as interior minister , he was located at results in a broad consensus within the Coalition . &quot;
in the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach during the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach . he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
&quot; now , however , the most extensive ones are made . &quot;
&quot; some is already known , announced , pro@@ filed : that a new safety authority is to take care of the bu@@ cket , is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU guidelines for passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
part starts de Ma@@ izi@@ ère a second match for proposals that were not to be done with the SPD : he wants sympath@@ ies for terror groups under punishment and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still consider it to be reasonable and demanding nothing that does not have any chances in co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they have partially in itself : it plans quick procedures for deportation and more opportunities for det@@ ention of people prior to exp@@ ul@@ sion .
&quot; refugees trying to be picked up into the country before , in order to disclose their smart phones and disclose social @-@ media accounts for a safety review . &quot;
&quot; in case of trials for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put even worse than before - about those who commit crimes or as@@ signing their papers to conc@@ eal their identity . &quot;
some of this is political and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and for some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of ge@@ dul@@ ated for example - raises the question : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it cannot be said to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people faced the great refugee concerns about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that deeply dealt with people at times , were not settled in the election times . &quot;
inner security is enormous into the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are choices . &quot;
&quot; with respect to the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD is thus becoming increasingly dependent on position . &quot;
in the past few days there went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ger struggle about the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a secure policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chefs also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a desc@@ end of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also lab@@ eled here to reconc@@ iling tones .
from a desc@@ end of the double @-@ pass it was nothing .
we have not for@@ ged the discussion in Germany
&quot; finally , it is not useful . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he &apos;s constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality , it has to be shown . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could worry in dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is trying to establish itself in the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled only at careful talk and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing certainty . &quot;
still comes Volkswagen glimp@@ ses .
in spite of diesel @-@ sk@@ and@@ als , the delivery publisher loads worldwide . &quot;
&quot; but not in all markets , it is running round . &quot;
&quot; in return , there is an indication of a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries to the second half @-@ year @-@ work .
&quot; Europe &apos;s biggest high@@ ways in the past year , despite the diesel @-@ aff@@ aires , thanks to its many brands and some good run markets can continue to be a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July it weak@@ ened the nuclear mar@@ ke VW mainly in Western Europe , and has led to the overall sales of the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the brand has sold VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market in Western Europe , the sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ed the shipment to almost a Six@@ th .
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann conducted the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there have been a department store in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation concerning the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was deb@@ ited from the EU as well , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the gas@@ k@@ aff@@ aires initially escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected Hau@@ ke of Nieder@@ sachsen is now further im@@ min@@ ated by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a measuring range of 0.7 per cent to 3.8 million vehicles at Bu@@ che . &quot;
consolidated Board Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales team from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had t@@ amper@@ ed with a software subscription .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW around 2.5 million cars calls for a retro@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance . &quot;
&quot; the bus point out the customer after the change@@ over a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate from , &quot; I am not talking about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in a corporate journey . &quot;
reason : legal justi@@ fication .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen to consider his German customers now a guarantee for re@@ produced diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
&quot; according to the Ministry of Defence , this meeting was confirmed . &quot;
&quot; VW has made the conditions of my enquiry commission , and the mission of KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or performance @-@ performance after conversion , no deterior@@ ations take place and all the characteristic relevant vehicle values have unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate journey . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen allows the possibility that clients come for example a half year after the retro@@ fitting into a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that does not have anything to do with the sc@@ andal involving possible warran@@ ties , as it was meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; does not use . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is demanded by enough spar@@ ys in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 clients that leave 40 million euros on gre@@ ed or day @-@ off accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not look into a signal : normal austerity &quot; , &quot; should not be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; bear@@ ings banks spend money overnight in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0,@@ 4 per cent criminal off@@ s . &quot;
&quot; this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or non @-@ monetary accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future to 400 euro in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
it has been around 40 million Euros from one day to another and which he could not use .
&quot; they lie with me on the bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the chief manager . &quot;
I cannot lie for every one million 4000 euros .
the cost he will now give rise to the cause of the cause principle .
&quot; the cash simply falls into the cas@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four over@@ inci@@ dents , I do not have the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank@@ rupt . &quot;
most customers would have sympathy and varied to other systems .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co@@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry on it alone , &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
with criminal off@@ ences for deposits of three million euros had made the Thur@@ in@@ gia and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Skat@@ eboard @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 Head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , principal commercial leader of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , this competition is much too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is a chin @-@ up , which is equipped by the property somewhat lush . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if they are free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
in the region known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ oper@@ atives of Bavaria &quot; are currently no further banks known , which comp@@ elling a deposit for deposits of private customers , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ feder@@ ations of German foreign banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ ders ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared an end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives compared to the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it dro@@ wned the migration from An@@ ders to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not let themselves be fallen in the width .
destination tops : who does not buy record @-@ boards ?
lonely Men middle ages love plates .
&quot; before you head to the commentary box to so@@ w him under the alias of non @-@ leather men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement dire@@ cts of up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ dimension@@ able recovery process has not been due to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life @-@ no@@ stalgia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all predic@@ tions under the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely c@@ ay@@ ey group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older record ais@@ le keep their feelings more suitable for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend their time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but will the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest grey cas@@ c@@ utter , before I stand , my hands , and a bit determining how : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos slowly introduced to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera to the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and farm . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I followed by S@@ ister Ray ( Daten@@ count : two young women , three men middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men middle age ) , a woman , presum@@ ably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have ca . 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; this sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records as they had appeared and again to buy objects that he sold , when he was young and pl@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; many things that I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ s that was published than I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably somewhat young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy the plates , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and happy to spend time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my lan@@ ster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers he meets to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people , who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have promp@@ ted to buy her old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have managed , people usually have done so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who were once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tr@@ ailers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores offers a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers were incur@@ red by the cont@@ ent@@ less payment system . &quot;
some plate @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to re@@ vo@@ ke the stability of familiar b@@ atten@@ tions from objects that are more happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is with me as collectors so and I think it is with many people so .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ ees a employee of a record @-@ stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record , they have not yet been heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % possess a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who own a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I was pet@@ alled by a stack of the Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( a number of men : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; trophy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I had no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product las@@ hing , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ y . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who are getting to come slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p that has dedicated the b@@ ump nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ az@@ ed crowd when I re @-@ going . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women aged . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the standing @-@ standing stores is - Wild Be@@ asts , syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tant pop in instead of experimental jazz dr@@ apes out of the l@@ oud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks son@@ ically lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ otic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be adjustable when you are standing next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looked at the variation of the equipment for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window of mor@@ tal @-@ sle@@ eves as a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collection of plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from one computer or in another way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record @-@ lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give to encour@@ agement , the je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ p@@ ants to mu@@ ster , I observe a group of young teenage girls , group@@ ed for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter consider to be able to buy a cro@@ sl@@ ey turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to attach them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for this items could mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research inquiries made that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in records in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , who exist in reality , plate business and in Onlin@@ e@@ for@@ en , un@@ considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the leg of plate of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while having the rigi@@ d eye of an un@@ fur@@ tive , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator mei@@ den , who crosses nothing at the shoulders of middle aged men . &quot;

French Court rejected an offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp .
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants within the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live , down . &quot;
&quot; in case of trial , this week argu@@ ing the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ ing stores , sell hair@@ sty@@ ling services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be oppressed , because they would pose a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and which side a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups formed the court that the businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
it also resulted in that the provisional business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the reference of people who have the 72 pro@@ visional business , but sum@@ med that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais is absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people feed , who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting will offer among refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the t@@ ear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café des Lag@@ ers , which is hosted and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on Asyl@@ um , for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; Café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure for this children of a catastrophe would be of which the most recent eight years old . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany Ras@@ mes are to adjust to the next generation of speed kni@@ fes : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new light@@ ning devices will be tested particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement trailer from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can for instance be used at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on the highway construction or on sandy bridges , with temporary templates , there are often no necessary infrastructure to care there with a stationary bore for compliance with speed b@@ umps . &quot;
it can be a long @-@ known mobile construction but can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a mo@@ dem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also take up all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as transi@@ tions for time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ class condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with a trailer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply cl@@ oned to it , it is hung in the measurement @-@ operation , so that the wheels will disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also de@@ generation outside . &quot;
furthermore an built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzen before v@@ and@@ alism .
&quot; since 2015 , trailer for information from Vit@@ ronic is tested in various Länder since 2015 and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; also , foreign authorities are fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently France 100 pieces and returns , after an order from 150 copies last year . &quot;
great Britain takes place silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by following Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came on Thursday night at a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ stepp@@ ing , desc@@ end , line @-@ run and ro@@ her power to win Gold - her first Olympi@@ astadi@@ on of any color . &quot;
defeat was vers@@ ed by the not too bad tro@@ l@@ preis of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth in this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the people , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to her in the final . &quot;
but independent of that Fi@@ ji would have made a 15 @-@ man team in order in this form .
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal in order to hang his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is Chief Ben Ryan , the former chef for England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
in the UK had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost her playing at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this work@@ book will be w@@ asted , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began won@@ dro@@ us and let the attacks look out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co. at , when one run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of the time , Jerry Tu@@ wai still made another attack from the right corner , which he turned into . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly added the ball .
&quot; a standing T@@ ackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain by man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third goal , but it has only stopped fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute of time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ump@@ ed through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the transformation brought an 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still fails . &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced basic changes to the half time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time well , until Joshua ran into a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for the UK , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ aner , whose fans s@@ angen , flags and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i icing with a further attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff pastry , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged themselves and GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hing in the lawn . &quot;
previously on the day Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and the UK urged South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ end match from the race - British transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant Tac@@ ist of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , safest the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ous gold than in these games and that will mean what they mean .
&quot; from the first rowing back to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the con@@ es , which were on the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present as she sent to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without tax @-@ woman in a row that laid out on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ ter would be un@@ com@@ promised use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we are seeing are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de about the surface with the elegance of Spon@@ ges , which is not reflecting the type of tri@@ umph@@ ant too ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the Ru@@ gs is a batt@@ ali@@ on , willing to make the difference and it was no one @-@ known as the coach , which would not happen before 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all , when cancer was diagnosed . &quot;
as he said he is risky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , who is op@@ eri@@ zed and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty sh@@ lim@@ me situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start at the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , which could start the break at a minimum , in case that is not at all the right term . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go better with me soon .
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the un@@ il@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a rainy morning to talk something more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was considered principal mann at the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repeated , how much to me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I could not have improved a better person for traders or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
&quot; even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark joined forces , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very tr@@ apped in the moment .
Helen called &quot; abi@@ ding in the process , abi@@ ding in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not tear down .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not interested in doing something tac@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ works , we just wanted a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just want to enjoy the moment .
I did not say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ asi@@ an . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so soci@@ able .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exempl@@ ary for clarity :
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose of &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ group &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert Gö@@ ller , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the Association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water served as a model for the big water producers .
this was the name of some time in the origin@@ al@@ on in a post by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the Wasser@@ forum was announced by the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ te group &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband Staff , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
&quot; now , he was retirement in retirement at the age of 65 . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ te group , located in the Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of broad@@ brunn , employs some 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 residents . &quot;
&quot; member states are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , wides@@ cre@@ en , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supplies .
&quot; the current chairman , wides@@ cre@@ ase mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was set in 1985 as water audi@@ ences and was appointed as Managing Director until 1988 . &quot;
&quot; its tasks have been very mani@@ fold and they extend from the water level and maintenance work on office and organizational skills , the budget , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency events on weekends , &quot; said the Chair . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events called it the start @-@ up and initiation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer system ( 2004 ) , the re @-@ procurement of a central computer system ( 2004 ) and the divi@@ der of water pipes . &quot;
there have been no stand@@ still and you always recorded innovations because water is be@@ ute and drinking water the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he used with a great deal of heart for his water @-@ purpose and he lived reasonably for the water @-@ purpose association than it would be his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he as a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to the nit@@ rate of the district of the district of Lower Fran@@ ks . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller @-@ sto@@ wed Wasser@@ bau Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water audi@@ ences and he was a faithful sh@@ outing .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as high@@ points from his point of view , he referred to the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tube @-@ bur@@ st at the floods in Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd January .
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees all the night will work , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supplies of Neu@@ brunn also only can only be maintained , because one filled the cups of P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer to enter the succession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man took up on Friday against 10.@@ 45 in an apartment house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner and un@@ har@@ med them .
&quot; the man himself called upon us and stated his life &apos;s companions , &quot; said a police . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I will publicly mention . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown , and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
meanwhile the police has published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a glow .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he can still carry the weapon in itself , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who Sven S. sees , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police talks about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the k@@ iller in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in Lübeck , the responsible police in Lübeck did not intend to make no information concerning the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relation between the perpetrators and the victims ; but it confirmed that a person was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing , &quot;
&quot; more we are currently not saying , &quot; &quot; said a police @-@ speaker in Lübeck . &quot;

steel - light view of German steel industry
the crisis @-@ controlled and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in meg@@ acities .
&quot; financial burden , which is dro@@ pping from the industry out of the wast@@ ew@@ rom @-@ promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it abi@@ des for the release of the renewable energy system with components to the so @-@ called self @-@ production industry in the German steel industry , said the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Frei@@ tag@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; I am truly happy that we have finally achieved after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the European Commission was aimed at first planned , the steel producer , the gases out of the testi@@ cles to generate electricity generation for their own consumption , to the check@@ out . &quot;
the steel industry &apos;s steel industry reduced additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , I now give a basic certificate of the European Commission to talks with Com@@ peti@@ tive commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators are replaced in the steel plants , the case of an E@@ EG @-@ lev@@ y of 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall facilit@@ ated the agreement of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ stream production .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous settlement will be largely determined . &quot;
have special importance for the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel &apos; future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even when the reform of the emissions rights are climate and employment targets , IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from excessive r@@ arities and a significant price pressure in Europe since the financial crisis .
&quot; in the past year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fy as the world &apos;s largest producers of domestic demand in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand in the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel companies prize dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; in addition , the import duties on impor@@ ter effect , on the other hand the economic views of China arose . &quot;
unclear how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German Sec@@ ur@@ ism Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices could not be stag@@ nat@@ ured again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also wanted to shut out the closing arguments of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , some 86@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producer remain careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; raised by 3.4 million tons of good six percent less crude steel than in the pre @-@ year figure , as the economic association &apos;s association on Friday afternoon . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd went back for the second month of a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months the association expects an improved order situation , thanks to an improved order . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing does seniors well
&quot; the S@@ ingen has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school &apos;s choir , in the teacher training , she defeated the F@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old took her in a seniors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a test it feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
at the same time she does something good for her health and her mind .
&quot; for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ ker from the German senior liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ i@@ ores singers in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , senior people can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; they often solve social and family structures at age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir , &quot; Send To and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
because exercising seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
those who want to eat its lungs regularly in everyday life not as fast as the doll@@ s .
&quot; although it is about obtaining the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Bundes@@ labour @-@ community of the senior members . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint venture had a much higher priority ; it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz commonly observed that the singing or hearing of songs with older people are ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , deny yourself in the sick people for a long time . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head will also be demanded for a special performance . &quot;
concentrate on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , practicing so , not just to concentrate on himself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing by the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I have long been for something , I will be better and guarded by me - this experience will strengthen . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , there is so enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , suggests L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is listening , when a note goes off ? &quot;
on the search for the right offer seniors various possibilities , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; singer someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a seniors &apos;s choir , one can easily join it . &quot;
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can turn right to the church or the Chur@@ ches . &quot;
many seniors can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet can provide the family , friends or neighbors for help with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who would like to sing , should join in a choir , betra@@ ying Hac@@ ker . &quot;
singing is doing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats are responding sensitive as K@@ ater on Schrei@@ e of the kitt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover that the effect of cat@@ tery from cat@@ tery has grown to adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise the r@@ ust also left the males not cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always alike . &quot;
female cats may recognize the arousal level of cat@@ tery on the mi@@ sts of the children .
&quot; they respond to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of kitt@@ ens that found themselves out in great need , such as scientists found out of the veterinary University and Medical School ( U@@ MH@@ H ) . &quot;
kitt@@ ens also react to the herds of kitt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the ch@@ ew@@ ing of less and strongly reduced p@@ ups for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ ine Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first authorized in the study , published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch of the kitt@@ ens scre@@ ams with the ur@@ gency of their needs .
&quot; observed , a total of nine adult females and eight que@@ ens from the animal @-@ keeping of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; for you were played by the children of the babies , which were taken for three minutes from the throwing box and separated by both mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kitt@@ ens that were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers hold their results despite the low sampling test for failure .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted upon the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned to the l@@ oud@@ speaker to the l@@ oud@@ speaker when this ru@@ ff played the very er@@ rainy kit@@ ties .
this ability may be potentially inj@@ uri@@ ous or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined many times the reactions of women and men on baby di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ ine Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; after a cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football match in Turkey .
in Turkey against the un@@ sty football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ran@@ r was en@@ acted .
he will be accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey takes place an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ el of Arch@@ bishop Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; Business as the &quot; one is said .
&quot; already in the suspension of the tak@@ eout , after the overthrow of July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ alb@@ eit to be un@@ com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
it is also not done before football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ran@@ r put the prosec@@ utor a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; according to the meantime , the people of the South America were thrown in South America , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ n@@ r shall be the pend@@ ant of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup d &apos;@@ Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup . &quot;
&quot; although this first applies to 90 days of trial period still until October , in fact it has the most significant effect on the lives of most Turks but as well as no re@@ percus@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for termin@@ ated . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split up followers and opponent &apos;s Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not counted to the friends of the President .
&quot; but the Gro@@ s of the Turks however , given the most dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
there are even fans - no matter whether their heart beats for g@@ ach@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or bear .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; g@@ ala &quot; will be getting back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky .
his sporting importance was the Köl@@ ner in his ex@@ pi@@ red season . showing at 17 gates and nine assi@@ sts in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first play @-@ time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ winners .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square .
he concluded the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy .
thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; found the disappointing season for the record master a failed conclusion .
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; can result early in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only comes to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the Cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we have done and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as ran the game year better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who played the basis for the 14th title with 26 Seas@@ ons . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans continued to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; with the AC Florence under the contract and on B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as , the Gom@@ ez left only out@@ put@@ ted Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return , because of the political situation in the country after its European vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario but wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; k@@ icker &quot; &quot; club of the club Fi@@ ver@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storms would have to be ready to disp@@ ense around one third of his to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; his salary in Florence can we not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals for Olympics in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can only laugh at it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic of D@@ oping still determines the headlines from the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian shar@@ pen@@ ed in Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ bra , who had moved out shortly before the games , was mer@@ ci@@ zed shortly before playing ( 100 meters chest ) gn@@ oll@@ ed off and well @-@ drawn . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a mixed sm@@ iles at the hall she was still pro@@ voc@@ ed into the hall and pro@@ voc@@ ed with her appearance .
&quot; when it was determined that they will not be gold , the audience broke up in a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
but there are still numerous other sports@@ men who are going to start with the Olympic Games in Rio at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his ban , the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds , the number one in the world and is considered as the biggest sp@@ elling of Us@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion in 2010 had to sit down a six months after taking the in@@ ges@@ tion of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery I have had strong to@@ g@@ aches , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended itself . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was tested the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ s from 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ ans from 2010 to 2016 positive on the bot@@ anic stimul@@ ant for meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ a@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ kovic takes the wi@@ red intake and has been locked six months .
the four keys thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great Gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , 2010 was positive tested and 21 months have been closed . &quot;
&quot; of course , a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , drunk . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old above 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ vers , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes have been detected as many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing was established . &quot;
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ olds had to also leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ Tit@@ le 2006 because of testosterone @-@ abuse .
it was also recognized the bronze statue of the Olympic Games in 2008 as a part of the International Sports Court of Justice .
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is on the rank of two of the world &apos;s list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ant and Gold fav@@ ors was first tested in May , but may still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old World Championship , references to the intake of dietary supplements have been found , the spar@@ row of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on July 13th . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans hurt - maj@@ ere T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Frei@@ tag@@ on . &quot;
&quot; they suffered no@@ ises and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left this again . &quot;
it was planned in early September for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holidays of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also affected Austrian citizen , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in contact with the local authorities , so cuts . &quot;
&quot; at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok @-@ Hua H@@ in , there were initially on Thursday nights in a footh@@ ills of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ change had been killed and around 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red , including the Austrian , three Dutch , three Dutch and three Italian . &quot;
&quot; in early morning two Spr@@ eng@@ ages went up again , and the authorities were killed another human being . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs of bom@@ bs .
in the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular swimming pool Pat@@ ong Pat@@ ong was wounded according to police information a taxi @-@ driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast @-@ coast of the country , a further bom@@ b , which killed a city of city . &quot;
the spr@@ eng@@ ing was according to the authorities in a fl@@ oral pattern before the Re@@ four of the coastal police force in the air .
&quot; finally , the det@@ on@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on , on the southeast coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; one go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b attack carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said armies Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee open @-@ day prior to journalists . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are assum@@ ing that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attacks . &quot;
&quot; it is too early to express themselves for possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognise in the attacks a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b attack Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police on the other hand , however , the attacks of the attack in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or against international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
rather one go out of the fact that the bom@@ bs of enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; for the past few days the authorities have received sec@@ recy evidence on im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
be unclear which group behind the attacks are still unclear .
&quot; the police took their officials across the country to reinforce security around important governmental buildings , as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always minor bom@@ bing proposals , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Adu@@ ly@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the course of the bom@@ bs bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advised to perform the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) approved for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after conflicts between security forces and Muslim people , people will not get off necessary trips to these provinces . &quot;
raised safety risk ( safety stage 2 ) approved for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this led to the military influence even in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the Bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ ce chaos , while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized the power after a period of bloody un@@ rest , keeping the kingdom back into stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not been able to cope with the military rebels in the far south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has got into the visor of the Federal Ministry for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several countries , the Constitutional Court also introduced the Group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we are seen in the &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; &quot; cl@@ ue to efforts against the free democratic fundamental order , &quot; said Constitutional Protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , Zu@@ w@@ other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we are monitoring the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by estr@@ ang@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority have been closely coordinated with the state of the state . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally try to address extre@@ mi@@ sts , to address more with adol@@ escent music , often with p@@ opp@@ ies music . &quot;
&quot; the former Islam@@ ists , as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
that is not concrete advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda is intended to address the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are very sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there has been reports of several federal states reports on the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that he did not have any knowledge .
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts in this manner may be relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist , their target area and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so if such individuals have control over the party .
this is not apparent .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in ri@@ fu@@ eled criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context yet again from the new right terrorism . &quot;
&quot; however , in recent years we have noticed that it can enter right @-@ term structures . &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Group .
&quot; it can be quite that further ri@@ ghtful group@@ ings or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attack from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nation@@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of justi@@ fication is not apparent .
the present groups were based on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate had expressed that many over@@ gri@@ ps came to the account of people who have not entered into the right scene before . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated , or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed previously with right extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left elected , however , have been radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing voting rights . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te will become the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ astadi@@ ks or Wel@@ fare the Head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ ly swimming swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slowly that he temporarily didn &apos;t see any more in the TV pictures . &quot;
he disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te was subsequently to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds with a retreat and won the 5@@ 9th position of 59 Star@@ tern . &quot;
but it was rather a not just spor@@ ty figure that attracted attention from the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians took a special start from the international swimming @-@ association .
this will be distributed to make swimming in under@@ stated countries more known .
&quot; since in Ethiopia , most sports@@ men would have to run , just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname made the round .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in connection to a &quot; &quot; Well @-@ stone &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &apos; The Sun &apos; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of outdoor style , did not play a role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney run the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforget@@ t@@ ably the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete alone in an out@@ run over 100 metres of his style .
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically was called M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
&quot; the time of 22 @-@ year @-@ old got to swim until eight months before Olympia , and had never taken such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping elec@@ om situation not so tight
the Republi@@ can Pres@@ did@@ at Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election event in Florida .
&quot; if there was nothing to do with the election to the U.S. President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative to alternative . &quot;
he then go into the holiday .
&quot; loses Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , would allow him a relatively long , long holiday , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Candi@@ date of Republi@@ cans in an telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in this way he drew the US President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the Islamic State of Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
within its party more and more resistance has been formed .
post increases in trade with elec@@ tro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle &apos;s vehicle by Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vessels is apparently large .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Street@@ sco@@ oters .
&quot; in short , the Group will start trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to provide its elec@@ tro @-@ transpor@@ ter from the coming year on the free market .

&quot; in post @-@ own production , the company has the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ der announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and make a full conversion to the environment @-@ friendly vehicles in the long term . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very ru@@ gged step towards 2020 , &quot; he had said in the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we face the complete fleet .
the Street@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership occurs after disappointing business
the consumer @-@ research company Gf@@ K exchanged his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the return came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed to susp@@ ect , that the chair of Vor@@ ar@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann will all be more uncertain , the longer the successes remain after him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of Nuremberg &apos;s market research company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ continued business and the resign@@ ation of the company &apos;s leadership is the global number five in the industry in front of a personalized new beginning .
the G@@ FR@@ P @-@ Management boss wants to leave the company for the end of the year .

&quot; the leadership of the Management Board over the first of September , the management board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger shared the company . &quot;
&quot; he is said to take on the function of a &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot;
as the reason for the return steps the company called &quot; different views &quot; to the long @-@ term business orientation .
details wanted to be called a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be in charge of the market research company in future is still unclear .
&quot; in An@@ leg@@ ality , it was called on Friday , at the shareholders , the disappointment was recently initiated on the continued success of the past years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of the restructuring is not yet to be seen after 5 years , called it . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , every branch of shareholders will eventually be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case of BMW , this would also be the qu@@ and@@ als . &quot;
the company had no loss of losses in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .

accidents - bus sli@@ pped in Krum@@ m@@ n in Gra@@ aben : eight wounded
&quot; in an accident of a tour with 43 seniors as a passenger , on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ cro@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) have been viol@@ ated eight people . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ ars suffered serious injuries , shared the police with . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to do@@ ve their information according to an attack , which was partially on the road . &quot;
the bus arrived right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus self @-@ continually , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade fre@@ ed the in@@ mates .
six b@@ ail@@ out cars and a emergency project came to the accident on the inland . 2 .
the un@@ final travellers were brought back from a regular bus to Krum@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
&quot; here , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel enterprise . &quot;
investig@@ ators demanded the rich@@ es and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic se@@ wage are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , 3.@@ 44 instead of previously opened Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously : 18 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until : 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage charge will be re@@ activated at the latest later when corresponding improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a ski@@ pping calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was detected with the approval of the household by the Land@@ rat@@ ory Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that covers housing for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
the Kaz@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated due to its legal basis to operate the systems cost @-@ friendly .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from world cup , new@@ dorf , re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg have to hold deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the en@@ stir@@ red increase is between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative head of Herbert Schmidt on the body , Herbert Schmidt was necessary for the water @-@ operation of the market community . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , be super@@ se@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the gr@@ ading en@@ closure of the increase was founded in all three se@@ wage systems with relatively small se@@ wage systems , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution of distribution , for example , for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; moreover , waste water in all three plants is slightly decreased . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , at all three plants in the past three plants are not least due to its age san@@ itation and repar@@ ations in considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for world meals , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the wast@@ ew@@ ater Az@@ endorf which had to be exchanged on the basis of a compens@@ atory system .
&quot; in the pump world cup , which had to be over@@ hau@@ led nearly 20 years old conveyor systems for the first to nearly 20 years of operation of the first clarification , the clarification , and an additional ventil@@ ation can be implemented in the future to respect the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expendi@@ tures the more advanced training and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calendar period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the years 2011 / 2012 still considerably below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that in the small wast@@ ew@@ ater attack in the three plants will strike the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; whether , in addition , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs have been spar@@ ed in the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above @-@ mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious in the duration of stone buildings on the long run , especially since we can not extend the supply area of the Ab@@ water @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these plants , because it is a deficit of interest . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s book for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % . &quot;
annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0 % . &quot;
the in@@ flow rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amoun@@ ted to 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amoun@@ ted to 0.2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as asi@@ an cartoon
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel towards breeds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily uses to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already as absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure resulting from a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ uni@@ zed , idi@@ zing tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ects per day . &quot;
all the tr@@ ams arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat @-@ Filter have drawn criticism in the past viewed in which they have accused that the app Black@@ face would prop@@ ylene or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week caused a few im@@ ents a filter , which gave them sl@@ ack , wrong teeth and im@@ pris@@ oned che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lo@@ wing . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeated contro@@ versy had to be a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it could have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ standing , the r@@ attle has experienced , remembered the filter at breaking clim@@ bers . &quot;
others reject the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail she wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter &apos; hur@@ t@@ ful and sa@@ wing was un@@ pleasantly annoying . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the opposite position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filter@@ ing effect .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not clear , but that the yel@@ lo@@ wing has been de@@ duc@@ ted into the extreme extremis@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural st@@ ack@@ et .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless life and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - that is di@@ vers@@ ed in the matter of breed than their older counter@@ parts - could be expected to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filter@@ ing a picture is created , that for a user , it &apos;s much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product management and engineer for medium , your Snap@@ chat account , called for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she told that she does not want to reflect a lack of diversity among the settings practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u cri@@ tici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended up their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they do not have various represent@@ ations of people with other skin colour in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors , who work there but are not in positions of which they are safe or comfortable to tell what about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any figures concerning the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there is Snap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to one speaker , the company has recently focused a personnel responsible for rel@@ ayed population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she is closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder whether they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
military duction distor@@ tion ISIS sec@@ ession information and presents the Committee of Congress
&quot; military depen@@ dents of the United States Central Command have changed legal information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force by Republi@@ can members of the Defence Forces and the Wehr@@ Com@@ mit@@ ees , secret services and the defence budget , reported by large dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence agencies , reported how they lost their ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news @-@ service information that were typically dismis@@ sed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders , reported regularly a posi@@ ti@@ ver@@ ted image of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were all positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering , if poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; held Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can@@ ese Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the manag@@ erial error in the Cent@@ Com reach up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ round report shows detailed explanations in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that government pointed under Obama statements , it shows how analy@@ st exposed to the pressure from their pre @-@ laws , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements from the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com inv@@ ests publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ cons@@ s can begin already in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ con@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ cans of Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2014 , the peaks of the Central Command have changed the re@@ vocation reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into Life , after they were played , that an@@ al@@ ysts are worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detail findings during the investigation .
additionally further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee on Thursday released their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com have created a limited process for the creation of im@@ pedi@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest grade democr@@ at in the Committee of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; del@@ ayed the release of post @-@ investigations reports , &quot; asham@@ ed the morality of an@@ al@@ ysts and &quot; gave a little space for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. ship and Democrats agreed not to have any references to an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com an@@ al@@ ysts in terms of a &quot; specific political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the General Assembly of the Pentagon , which were recorded according to the complaints of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a media pre@@ acher of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would have no reports of Congress while the investigation of the General inspec@@ tor are still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes thoroughly diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome the contro@@ versy of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
investigation impacts on the question of a successful campaign campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; but the alleg@@ ations of the last year have raised the question , how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest inspec@@ tions of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State are remin@@ is@@ cent of more than ten years ago than a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts at George W. Bush contrary to the recommendations of many an@@ al@@ ysts in Iraq and took little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to provide government officials to have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terror group , as these temporary refin@@ ing could have put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition has not been published , the Times in September reported . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the term for his super@@ moder@@ ately positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US gains fourth match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women - a show@@ down with the UK is before
&quot; one day after having shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American army ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans with 3 @-@ 0 p@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she cannot remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not among the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , this knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place which after their 2 @-@ 0 win against Japan remain un@@ brid@@ ged . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two in their group will gain from six teams in the first and second place . &quot;
the first plat@@ ter will take a little longer in the way that the other group will lead to the other groups .
&quot; as always the game started on Saturday , the Americans have triggered by their success story by their success story , four years after they landed over the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters also played the sport at the Dre@@ x@@ el University ) with 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as it could not qualify for the cad@@ res . &quot;
then came the year 2012 when she and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working order in London that we now have .
we have been able to plu@@ ck the ruin .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back@@ stroke from the se@@ am . &quot;
&quot; India was gone out without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed up surprisingly , and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am the game took up in their hands . &quot;
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball through the left fl@@ anges and then moved to the center and l@@ up@@ to the ball into the gate to get the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will hin@@ ge from the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Bre@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and in@@ es@@ capable of , a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and pride . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning st@@ ab , derived from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the float towards the Tur@@ n to the Tri@@ ath@@ l@@ eten . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch the TV to read a newspaper or listen to a conversation of your neighbours in the queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ pers , without much about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ e@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a female @-@ warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could well have been sent under these known names which would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and Well @-@ bed advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even hair . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ery to gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame is not lit any event immediately .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shoot , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the ni@@ p@@ swimming and may rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I might make modest arguments for my particular car@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jumping has been a Olympic Event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney the last 16 years has been so annoying , that many that I had asked , did not know that it is an Olympic @-@ sport . &quot;
it could be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent Ath@@ l@@ ete to competition , there has never been a medal in the tramp@@ oline and had an ath@@ l@@ ete it had until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for both the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans who share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline ski@@ p has a certain out@@ si@@ der char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a cl@@ own@@ ing school as the sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an enligh@@ tened enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has humor@@ ous potential - the me@@ tic@@ ulous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end up - but also the Grazie of the gymn@@ asium and pi@@ geon containing two sports that it is essentially united .
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jumping winner on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot at almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , H@@ genuine and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympic @-@ speaking after execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the common oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medalli@@ sts must go further in their quest for gold , go faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes down and back down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they chase not only the accordion or the cur@@ led wall , but in the TV transfer also another caves : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the target pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even sti@@ r an audience of tears . &quot;
&quot; but it is also what I think , when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring . &quot;
of this the tramp@@ oline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spray is above .
a forward @-@ moving movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she jump@@ ed off , apparently wei@@ el@@ os like an astr@@ on@@ aut , goes upward , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no cur@@ ves into the distance , just dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it can be just as Zen in the Olympic Games in the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification round and final women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC won the end as part of a afternoon @-@ blocks on both days from 2 : 00 p.m .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will likely over@@ looked the general tumor . &quot;
&quot; when the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved by the og@@ ling and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his according to air rin@@ se , new fan@@ community . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is a fo@@ e of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , calling for political changes in Ethiopia , respect the violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that zig prot@@ ested during the cl@@ ashes with the police at sh@@ uss@@ sion .
is Ethiopia just going to break together ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months protests against the government , the country and refused to spread out more and more territories . &quot;
last week there were thousands of people on the streets and slo@@ wing fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave to that polic@@ emen were shot on zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and prayed .
&quot; changing videos on the protests that probably are from the last or the beginning of this year , show such as safety people with pus@@ h@@ ers , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN High Authority of Human Rights is now asking for an introduc@@ tory investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terror over the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy has expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new fin@@ er train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to be repres@@ sed by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , whereby the govern@@ ors were to be sil@@ enced . &quot;
many were sent into exile or in prison or were driven to the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; when you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central @-@ Ethiop@@ ians . &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground @-@ use to the stran@@ gl@@ ehold concerning the power of the governing coalition .
&quot; following a widespread election of last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions walk along the border to Eritre@@ a ; a battle for this z@@ ak@@ ot , controversial line called for June hundreds of lives . &quot;
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden which were forced in recent years more or less imposed by tur@@ mo@@ il and re@@ armament again .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of prior to the surface now explo@@ ding .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media since cheaper smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even when the government uses access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , most importantly , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies who hide , where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians showed that they gathered so many protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ ed the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from etheric countries , in politics and economy , while the Oro@@ mos exploited , many of which are many Muslims and live in flat @-@ land areas . &quot;
but also this is changing .
&quot; we are here to co @-@ ordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , at the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion , was until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ al@@ ysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in this , early signs of dis@@ content perceive and non @-@ contractors to process opponents and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analyses . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ians new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ disp@@ uted reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of North @-@ Ethiop@@ ians , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he has not received the confidence of the tig@@ ray controlled by the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia has been living such tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , according to the analy@@ st of analy@@ st apparently , and subsequently stolen from the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ ors , many prot@@ ested were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia leaders to their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new fin@@ ite process , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ understanding of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; the last month of attacked prot@@ ested in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ous city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is getting more and more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests supported the USA and other western allies in a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American Government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ trips beyond the neighb@@ oured Somalia , even though they recently said that it has closed this basis . &quot;
&quot; while the West will clearly support democracy , he does not want his fo@@ e collap@@ sed in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin grass . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy in Friday that his campaign surrounds him that his repeatedly repeti@@ tive claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fying these clari@@ fications had raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Republi@@ can , whether he is able to communicate with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his supporters , who endeavour to take him during an un@@ event@@ ful phase , to explain in the actual position , declar@@ ations , that he might not have meant to be meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the conf@@ ection@@ ery of a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the President and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to weak@@ en the statement , he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can presidential elections wanted nothing to know . &quot;
&quot; the final storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ selt down Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to dec@@ aying envel@@ ope to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again on this subject . &quot;
&quot; through Twitter , he than@@ ked that Mrs. Clin@@ tons will bring suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism , when he said , the Russians should rejoice Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ emails , but he said later &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ey , I said the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will arrive as they arrive and then if necessary , &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in a different way . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more engra@@ ved note because its circum@@ stance has gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday showed a tour with great advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ an @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally attempts to un@@ ap@@ ologi@@ ze for its pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics frequently to cr@@ ush his statements or his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is a focus of attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps has brought his loyal co @-@ strikes in the un@@ comfortable situation to be able to stand independently of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps most prominent Für@@ s were to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , was asking if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton was founded in the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS I was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bone , completely false and therefore it came to pass the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am Republi@@ can attempt to argue that the government headed under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an external Secretary , it was allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively to take control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and thre@@ w them against each of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he burned the &quot; poor , j@@ äm@@ mer@@ ical &quot; TV experts who try to understand it and said , &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! . &quot;
some of the Democrats spot@@ ted on Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he may be un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once more than the price of the market , café is returned in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a compens@@ ated cafe in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash but not a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices of his Bedford Avenue and Eastern Front has been pushed away . &quot;
&quot; the business of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which was released in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local negoti@@ ates it as the last loss in anti @-@ gent@@ ri@@ fic@@ ated city .
&quot; Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change but I can still not believe CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb now is a soap @-@ business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also a re @-@ finding . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ busy Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is also always good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer had offered to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so @-@ in model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he brought new ingredients .
on the carte there are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are clo@@ cks like cap@@ tures and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural rides .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez , that he noticed a st@@ alled stream of old tri@@ bal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also ur@@ ned by prices of Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt in Williamsburg and visited Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , it would take the path to itself . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she was a while reading the coff@@ im@@ ham , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it was coffee and the culture in the verb , which I fell , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea to do this day instead of their usual I@@ ced tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ o and prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still its usual order , but sometimes he changes his everything thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t be Gro@@ ll that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has actually offered a special soap for cra@@ b with the cold coffee of the cafes as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into your offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to raise them soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ es local wants to fill the cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe is situated on an inver@@ ted building .
for many customers a new verb suff@@ ers to get their old favour@@ ites .
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regul@@ ator , and said that he was destroyed at the ground , when the cafe closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the prayer of the Lok@@ as and the bests@@ eller felt a new coffee and hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ wl , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt his lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets had President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tles .
&quot; his menu on this day was a bit modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , mas@@ hed and as dessert a pl@@ edge pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with poor people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e was added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans to eat as they eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ an .
&quot; founded last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; from the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when she met with a re@@ por@@ ter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ak@@ y I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the IP@@ RI crash in the shop . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cream with olive pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed and vegetable soup . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ por@@ ter Hack@@ br@@ ats ordered , this was the pair made to discuss the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut , liver and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap that extends the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as supp@@ er .
co@@ ils sm@@ ir@@ ds .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach as the lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; during the years ahead of the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , mainly in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ dar@@ s and it was fresh@@ ly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner served . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans , which killed during the first World War food to a da@@ zz@@ ling Europeans . &quot; a Square meal &quot; stands out the ways of which the country had been converted , no longer the sc@@ aff@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense subject , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new Bud@@ get@@ away : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and bar@@ gain were to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ ants as a &quot; wonderful way , eating remains @-@ confidence &quot; , &quot; mer@@ ced Zi@@ egel@@ man , because chefs of un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients were hidden under a kre@@ mi@@ gen Sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap drying .
&quot; meat , for years the center of the American cuisine was , became a rare ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing gr@@ ati@@ fication has had to taste in front of taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , we prepared a dish from that time , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a favorite addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann leads further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , the Financial Trade Union - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , the eating habits of the country is so rich . &quot;
&quot; published by these recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge , pamp@@ er like cre@@ am@@ y sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square meal &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , how President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farm @-@ living room of his kitchen , he felt like the milli@@ on@@ ous man of the world , which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost deser@@ ted dining room and carried one tu@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt probably had the same mistake , if not his wife had called Ele@@ an@@ or him to stat@@ u@@ ate him with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hypo@@ critical of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought forth the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most frequently prepared food in Washington . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food deal , was rejected , once the country returned to the legs again . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food items . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave in writing the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law , for example , how they could not throw food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded , &quot; &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind beut@@ ler .
&quot; after the dish was cleared from Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they went and co@@ e a dessert that had prepared them at home : the p@@ aving of Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes was to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no p@@ lag@@ ged cream , only pl@@ anting , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone stood a bit contradic@@ ted a spo@@ on in the tough , brown limbs . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ e took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o
he sat down his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives .
now is the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even during a bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil fire group , which has so far saved the life according to the image newspaper until almost 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteer work their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group , a video of the civil servant , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a su@@ king from the ruins of a house , went to the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbolic figure in the Gre@@ ys of War .
&quot; however , as a hero he has never seen himself said , according to picture : &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am dying to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar was killed himself an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombar@@ d@@ ment in Syria . &quot;
&quot; helic@@ opter have rejected four bom@@ bs over the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven men suffer from respiratory . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ isons of the bom@@ b , lest children play with it , &quot; quoted the picture of his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest sp@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually happens in winter only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the route S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got up with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; in common , the Greenland shar@@ k along the ground of the North Atlantic along , at an hour , he appears on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it reaches , speeds up the five meters long animal on s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
but this of the lon@@ eliness of life seems to be a pat@@ rol for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity &quot; , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ra@@ lein from Max @-@ Plan@@ ck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; although , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are being painted . &quot;
only fails the evidence .
&quot; Greenland is hard to watch , eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sk@@ inny co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface only in winter . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know little . &quot;
her tim@@ es@@ up@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ ßen it when they used six animals with a transm@@ itter equipment .
&quot; loot make this ha@@ ie yet : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a ru@@ b , another had sho@@ cked the j@@ aw of a young ice @-@ bears . &quot;
possibly they chase sleeping @-@ like animals or pat@@ rou@@ illi@@ ers at the bottom of the ice cream and look at Kad@@ aver which extends from higher water layers to the bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fisher@@ man between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a guide from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timet@@ res .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the ey@@ eb@@ inth is born already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the characters contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a great deal of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 50s , as the Atom@@ ic @-@ prolifer@@ ation , bigger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in that with 220 cen@@ timet@@ res length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ t @-@ runs of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeters long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed a age of 335 , while the record H@@ ai with 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeters can be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k can only get lag@@ ged when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length were able to assign . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timeters , probably on the threshold to the sexually mature women and his age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie become apparent at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
&quot; also , this is likely to be the world record for sp@@ inal animals . &quot;
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in vain waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland w@@ al , whose bac@@ on was put up a 120 year old har@@ po@@ stage , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperature , the organism also runs on austerity . &quot;
so they mature later - and al@@ ters slowly .
&quot; to keep in the cold water warm , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface resulting from the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of the elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous , and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible . &quot;
but a very big animal on the other hand should invest in long life on the other hand .
wall @-@ cent@@ ri@@ pe in double @-@ pack
&quot; with topics related to the building of the building , the municipal council has focused on the recent meeting in the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of the younger @-@ proven housing surfaces can be started . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ li@@ abilities and locking issues have been clari@@ fied and the requests to survey were made , the sale of plots in the housing areas &quot; &quot; road road &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction stage 1 ) to pro@@ spective buyers nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the structures in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and pure seniors alike .
&quot; as it was , Bau@@ will@@ s can report immediately in the Town Hall , about the distribution of plots , the council is expected to advise in his September session . &quot;
&quot; to also request requests for the relocation of other commercial enterprises , connected to job creation , decided to investigate the municipal council , which will be re@@ generated in the spring of this year in part of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of the &quot; &quot; Unter@@ lu@@ lar@@ t &quot; &quot; is extended there in the region around two plots towards the state . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of Main has therefore awarded the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of Excellence &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money @-@ houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass you have previously made the approval in the UK so far .
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced their jobs .
&quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs at the Main and five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is united to the monetary policy and supervision of the biggest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance coverage of EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the state bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg ger@@ m is a large f@@ ond@@ s@@ ist industry , but also like Dublin at the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
further points the city with easy available commercial properties .

Jewish director explo@@ de Berliner Hotel because Israeli presidential election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French fil@@ mm@@ aker with Jewish roots de@@ fes@@ ted a media watch , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pres@@ election as it would have requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust document &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; he sent his anger at Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site pre@@ di@@ st list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
after a statement the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; made him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure is a &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason that behind it was , extingu@@ ishes in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the election was deleted , was named by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli Ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Commerce , called a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and pl@@ ung@@ ed .
this is really very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has worn in exactly this hotel chain , is even a greater shame . &quot;
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the Hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
&quot; the incident has a pretty big reson@@ ance on the internet , in which people named a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some under@@ set the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged self @-@ demands of Arab guests .
&quot; be asham@@ ed of you , it was mentioned in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all the accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , tells the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel cannot in the quick@@ est list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man at any Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country &apos;s country has been added now .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increased to 71 % to - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade union between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in the annual comparison to 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies has grown strongly to businesses in the country divided by the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial cultivation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade union between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent br@@ unt and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran decreased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign assignment has been around 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , first instance of travel vis@@ as , an Iranian citizen . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries that concerns the tourist areas in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , some of which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition . &quot;

&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next novel@@ ty of all minist@@ ries , the upper minist@@ erial round of St. Anna had decided to prepare for the preparation and implementation of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage has been tested and finally decided on the Epis@@ cop@@ ed city of Freiburg , where it was on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opening of Mer@@ cy on Frei@@ burger Münster , offering a special pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ oms made their way . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in men &apos;s team Spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ us , who had made his land@@ owner Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he came home to win a win from the favour@@ ites . &quot;
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympics .
&quot; they reiter@@ ated the trick , after they took place in March at the rail World Championship in London , despite the back show Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the cycl@@ ist Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when they came up .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton were trying to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man who remained when they saw the potential of the vill@@ i , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - which won four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner , in the qualifying round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but won the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des was close to his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a big part of the transformation , when exec@@ uting in a higher gear to slow him and allow it to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and especially skep@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert in and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when these were on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison .
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name to me .
we have made a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the final and the world master defe@@ ats .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the side of the no@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di gave it to the subway after a weak start . &quot;
he returned later this statement and there was no objection of England ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time was no such problem .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have come so poorly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of knowledge , it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he has repeated ho@@ ys victory of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently hei@@ ghted date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a result of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the che@@ eses of the village of Ho@@ y equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which today begins and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the event event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten for the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medalli@@ sts of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four @-@ mile race . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won in London Gold at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will be in focus on the Wig@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; he had sl@@ ed yesterday with spec@@ ters before the qualification , when he called function@@ aries to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , the morning continues and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura D@@ ress , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in puppy time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team rel@@ ies on his strong railway cycle to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and fetch a flock to medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been down .
&quot; it also played pressures in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical body Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees itself the first evening of competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom on it , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached the perfect moment to its peak , again to be repeated again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ ting of Portland due to the abolition of the end of energy consumption
the future of the aluminum mel@@ t@@ els of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game as the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract and thereby raise every supply contracts , such as the deliveries of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the Government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years of payout usually runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake .
&quot; no less than 2000 work@@ stations , direct and indirect - could be at a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ance effects as the mel@@ ting is consumed about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ ting , which led last year to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risky .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the flow of electricity for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the great aluminum mel@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , distributed with that three other owners announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is in the multilingual ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , whereby the Chinese company CIT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller parts . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means further physical demand for power by the mel@@ ting , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; backup shop &quot; &quot; who had to come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts will have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will be contributing to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot;
&quot; all potential impact on AG@@ L , from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminals for large @-@ scale markets . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; to operate or ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year deal with Lo@@ y Yang , which was expected from November this year , even though it is still an explanation guilty of why it has resign@@ ed from the contract . &quot;

&quot; in reference to the statements of an@@ al@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland , approximately 600 meg@@ a@@ watts , and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;

&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September @-@ issue of VO@@ GU@@ E &quot;
&quot; all J@@ in@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the management and mother of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ in@@ ator C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September @-@ issue of the US VO@@ GU@@ E . &quot;
&quot; kend@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York ran , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to the wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ like family ) ( except the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ere ) as well as in the presence of the well @-@ known show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they stop the cover of their sister and end with a classic turn : you have all planned a surprise party .
&quot; this represents the kl@@ ash act of almost every Birth@@ day sep@@ is@@ ode ( Se@@ ac@@ rest restored the phrase , &quot; &quot; You are thinking that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this publication . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of VO@@ GU@@ E , VO@@ GU@@ E has certainly started a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim may suggest what the VO@@ GU@@ E cover is concerned ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September 2014 magazine is a League for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for VO@@ GU@@ E most of the most popular issue of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , the rather a picture band resem@@ bles as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the unvei@@ ling of his cover stars is looked so addi@@ ctive that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ ased prior to the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ awar@@ de@@ e and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after lady G@@ aga . &quot;
&quot; but even at the small chance that Mrs. J@@ in@@ ator - that is described as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; this celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or teenagers from today , who know how to create a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all of which is true of the denom@@ in@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are drawing themselves in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once released on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not success every one . &quot;
with their Reality TV @-@ history J@@ enn@@ ers was always tense in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ in@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and she called the Mist@@ pieces of the moment .
these feelings can come back high as the message with the Er@@ dem J@@ enn@@ ers come out on the VO@@ GU@@ E Cover .
but on the mis@@ fortune there seems to be on the point at the point .
&quot; all this denom@@ in@@ ator is on the cover of the September , the VO@@ GU@@ E . &quot;
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your gr@@ en@@ coding of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold by her done pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine SE@@ X@@ Y .
and in their free time it is in the Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers point annually 16@@ 0.000 people
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the most recent aid centers are rejected annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry is taken into effect on the effects of further mid @-@ level transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ ine@@ ings and similar ones - in their request for free legal advice and legal advis@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ dated , make for more cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their allies . &quot;
&quot; the director of the coun@@ cill@@ or centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municip@@ ality centres revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would be even worse without a repe@@ al of the decision of the government .
&quot; que@@ ens@@ ary community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services they need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with uns@@ ett@@ able and in@@ timi@@ dating debts , families that have been released through divi@@ ding , workers , the un@@ just @-@ wise wisdom - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 per cent , which means thousands of aid people from Queensland must be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the gener@@ an attorney and judicial Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , so that people will receive the help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the national government filled their commitment to lift funds for legal action on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centres and their customer communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries of elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; with the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for government authorities use SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
this celeb@@ s representative surveys of the opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ Zeitung ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government , in the north there might be less ruling in the north , this is not possible after the ques@@ tioning of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good chances to continue the government &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD cr@@ ashes of 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago at 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the Party fittings just barely just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be reduced to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens in spite of an easier loss of six percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) is back in the sword of the country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ os@@ sel@@ ections , the SPD of the survey was added only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; consequently , you blas@@ ph@@ emed behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 per cent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the or@@ derly .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor domin@@ ates today the world - its manufacturer lived a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost a half kil@@ ograms and was more than four@@ teen times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and larger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite a mu@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in store was at the beginning of eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , that would be enough for about two professionals with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; Nokia Communic@@ ator came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros you can buy the equipment still on the Internet , but they originate somehow from the stone age of the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ phal@@ ian format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser as well as qu@@ ag@@ oni@@ zing slow .
a hand@@ ball was available to a digit@@ ally addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be raised like a laptop . &quot;
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; pretty proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average price for a smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody was able to susp@@ end in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone @-@ era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
clever phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phones of the fin@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today the market domin@@ ate suppliers today that all got a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere be online , this is today for very many people everyday . &quot;
2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold around 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple suffer from 555 million pieces . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these include the well @-@ running shops of the countless app @-@ providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone , a whole industry has emerged . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was first launched at the beginning of 2007 , then announced by Apple Head Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World introducing the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; today , the iPhone starting from Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , launched by the market , had a view . &quot;
they disappeared after eventually Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ ages have now Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; in the inc@@ ision , each German is now looking for 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we have to learn all the smartphone also to go away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , responsible in the Siemens Board of Directors . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered to be a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must pull the oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only be in our local community and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the greatest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows , just like then in 2012 in London , when we operated a great deal of effort to make sure all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will be able to create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and create youth unemployment in the airport ground . &quot;
&quot; just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will fade away on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters were wrong with 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answered any given question . &quot;
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is a way of leaving up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in humor@@ ous growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have been a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been launched a £ 11 billion of infrastructure investments in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport enter@@ tain@@ er was built , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; it is time to ste@@ er this oly@@ mp@@ ic spirit , to expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; for companies who earn money with online money income , according to any of the software manufacturer attempts , ad @-@ lock bra@@ king , to deal with , a &quot; water@@ - and mouse @-@ game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that there &apos;s ad lock@@ ings on his desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus has published a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that his desktop site would change the en@@ coding of his advertisement , in order to detect it mark@@ ings on which part of the page advertising is to be complic@@ ate . &quot;
Ad@@ block announced that there is a new way to handle the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ c post the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle is already underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has started in the struggle is a strong indi@@ ces of how worrying indicator can become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use scor@@ eboard ; nearly four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 12,@@ 0 billion active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 per cent of the amount received Fac@@ ebooks from Facebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has it on the ad lock bra@@ king on desktop PCs , as mobile device lock@@ ers do not have an effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided an actors with . &quot;
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a enough large proportion of revenues in which Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as rewar@@ ding .
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad breeding &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said that Ad@@ blocks would be a worrying filter because they would also block the content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared an speaker of Facebook in an email notification . &quot;
&quot; ad lock bra@@ king are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have concentrated on the developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to place more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
women in suspected su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss highway
the victim was right in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to pass by a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday in a thought su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway .
&quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , close to Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight . &quot;
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the streets and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , which was passed by several vehicles , including a trucks , even to kill . &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police who call these and every witness of the incident to sign up . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a crash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - at which a person ran in the dark to the highway was decided that motor@@ ists do not have to assume that a ped@@ est@@ rians occur in the middle of the night on the highway as it was on the paper .
last year a polic@@ emen were acqu@@ itted by the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after they over@@ ride a man and killed that in August 2014 was one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrific@@ es had been drunk , and has become unconscious on the street . &quot;
&quot; the court set out that the polic@@ emen -- which had responded to an emergency way -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information on the incident occurring on Thursday near Morges , should register with the police below the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate @-@ dell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
Venus was probably extinct in the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate @-@ model once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus through tools and algorithms which similar to those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could be recorded with their hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once created . &quot;
scientists have noted that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and slowly re@@ twi@@ sted . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ating the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry regions than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to host life and facing fast de@@ ar@@ dis@@ armament . &quot;
the early Venus benef@@ ited also from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ model simul@@ ations exp@@ ose the slow turn of Venus their notes of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which works as an umbrella in order to pick up the surface of a large part of the sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , some degree of cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
the model brought a story of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously assumed by Plan@@ etary Research .
although it was presum@@ ably probably inhabited was the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ in a lot of heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; their oceans made dark , and their water v@@ ap@@ ev@@ ap@@ or was burned away from the ultra @-@ avi@@ olet light . &quot;
&quot; as its hydro@@ chlor@@ ic , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate @-@ model in the ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ space tel@@ es@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star P@@ lei@@ aden .
the new data help astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star enh@@ ancements are rotating at different levels as well as in the context of rotation periods with the planning process .
&quot; we hope that we experience through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ ters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Re@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ation , which originated about 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adult . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; to peak rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; because this win@@ ch is travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ w effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is al@@ tert , its rotation rate starts to dec@@ eler@@ ate . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ es the time between the appearance of a discer@@ n@@ able star @-@ angle -- as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive star slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dances , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star enh@@ ancements of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stell@@ ars qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ring of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and elderly , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how , When , When , and why the stars slo@@ w@@ down their rotation rates and say to say their &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in three newspapers in depth about their latest analysis of the pl@@ ural rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades Journal , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star comes from
the tears away at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball star in the best days from base to base .
&quot; after his emotional recall announcement , the 41 years old pro will carry on 12 August against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays , last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to the &quot; &quot; declared the 14 @-@ star @-@ game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was chosen for the most valuable players of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a tenth of the ten @-@ year deal had been accused of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be in future as a consultant and a youth coach - in full salary . &quot;
as a player there was Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle naval ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made it some mil@@ estones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics @-@ related values .
&quot; however , in the closed hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old might not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - Nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - in the field was , as controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 were forbidden to have ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was suspended until the end of 2014 for 211 matches until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main suspic@@ ious of years to have received anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida @-@ promoting means .
after a dispute the spar@@ row has been reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done me a favor for the year 2014 , for I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then south@@ ward . &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days do not go wrong .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games get even the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson news , sympathy types of fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee Ar@@ ri@@ v@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ rains &quot;
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test may not start wei@@ ght@@ fever Adrian Ziel@@ ony from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dex@@ ter@@ ings .
a caught Ath@@ l@@ ete had almost won a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ outs of the Olympic Games have become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meters of obstacles from Bulgaria and the Polish weight fever Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tic competitions , these messages are at in@@ time . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en last Sunday , the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d had been proven to be used as a mas@@ hing instrument for d@@ op@@ ing@@ substances . &quot;
the International Sport Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took place the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.7 seconds missed the bronze . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pre@@ ring over 50 m of freedom . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; the national association accepts the matter very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of the athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio se@@ ep@@ ed the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the forbidden substance to the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been disp@@ uted , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot;
&quot; Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister , Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w , they were able to speak immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not drag the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many have already been ruled out . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all the weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ ten@@ ded nation may not be able to participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg has been positive for three days prior to the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both disp@@ uted the intake , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the lightweight , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further difficult blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the whole Russian crew to an exception because of systematic d@@ op@@ ings the start , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced in Rio . &quot;
in the swimming pool the previous positions in China had taken care of fierce disputes between athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sh@@ e .

&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of his style , I want to pass it , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; said this . &quot;
sun was positive for the Chinese champi@@ onships positive to the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ac@@ din but had only had to sit a three @-@ month spar@@ row .
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ ets h@@ acker your ran@@ som
programmers of ex@@ tor@@ tion mal@@ ware respond to current companies and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies were at least once , partially several victims of an attack with black@@ mail@@ er software . &quot;
in Germany just 20 percent of firms were the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware detection .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the sol@@ vers demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alise their black@@ mailing @-@ software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack on nuclear networks .
&quot; are they successful there , the potentially cause @-@ pressing ran@@ som considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a fri@@ gh@@ tening fast evolution of damages , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
&quot; then , the perpetrators discovered ex@@ tor@@ tion software for itself . &quot;
&quot; only private user was the target , but the transition to company att@@ acking was carried out quickly during the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware operates after a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , it looks after long @-@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as the archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the black@@ mailing list .
&quot; to get the final code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where with private users the personal photo database is on the game , we are dealing with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is tac@@ kl@@ ed . &quot;
accordingly higher is the damage when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies raised sales growth by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to complete operations completely , in case of a case people were living in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of in@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , their data will get back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ r@@ ator in the light of breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user area and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they declare their victims by chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , free access sites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and we will rede@@ em individuals after payments of only a few hundred euros , companies have to pay hard to negotiate and five @-@ digit sums in order to withdraw their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware fatigue , the h@@ ackers become more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski of the Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software building at the actual black@@ mailing .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; in delivery includes an adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the press @-@ presses are then looking for more h@@ ackers in order to distribute the newly built software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so one log@@ gers in one of the forums in the underground , buying the set of a criminal , and asked another way to install the software on the most many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ filed machine .
&quot; usually calls the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data better . &quot;
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT entities in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey will trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be retri@@ eved by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful income , the perpetrators deri@@ ve from sensitive data such as customer list or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential according to the type of data is even higher than before . &quot;
the perpetrators will continue to take completely new objectives in the internet of things in the future .
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researcher , how to get it with the Internet linked thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the free@@ zing heating of such a block heating should indeed be a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block all the manufacturing road in a factory , ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in the industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all accounts
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and ready @-@ to @-@ date
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was actually very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in both the front row and in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls off . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; there is not only a trunk area of 45@@ 3 l provided with high @-@ ups and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seats of the back bench can be high @-@ valves and thus provide storage space , which is high from floor up to blank@@ ets 1,@@ 24 m . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well loaded , however the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the compar@@ ative Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l Diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide ranges of speed .
however he might do something wrong with his work .
welcome is the day @-@ day consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor ization : a 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel @-@ drive is not offered .
&quot; the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;

&quot; at the safety systems , the City @-@ Not@@ bra@@ inst@@ aller ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the trace system . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision occurs sometimes , because in the ran@@ som many obstacles are assessed as &quot; her@@ nia items . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works for the light assistant .

&quot; two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack , are available under arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward . &quot;
the some 29@@ ,000 euros for the well equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 exhaust norm .

&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten per cent of the guest will show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negotiated case , a family was hard on the second day of her tur@@ qu@@ ei@@ ty , difficult to diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .

&quot; however , the organis@@ er did not start just before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ es of it . &quot;
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was in order .

&quot; SPD CEO Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister said clearly against shareholders .

better traffic @-@ flow on the Motor@@ way@@ br@@ inger
it st@@ aut regularly on the route - here a picture from November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal framework should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the cars , who stand in the field of professional traffic on the ambient way each evening in the St@@ au when they are driving through the B@@ br@@ inger motorway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s road construction is extended by the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer and the departure of Wes@@ eler road to 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then cross directly from the hammer on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself , thereby causing the overall trial on the multi @-@ frequ@@ ented section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea of the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Court of Münster @-@ West .
driving distance on the listen@@ er is annoying the drivers from all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ day extends from the back@@ sli@@ ding to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her journey and sometimes beyond .
&quot; the reason is the needle @-@ hr on the B 51 , just before the departure of Wes@@ er Straße . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic is only distr@@ acted by the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be back on a well @-@ thir@@ teen years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge does not have the required lifting power , in order to move in particular the heavy @-@ duty cycle . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related tri@@ au will last , the responsible country can not be said . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official balance of time until the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal framework , the state of state has deliberately sought the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will be closed on Tuesday and on Wednesday to the construction site .
intercultural Travel : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster to visit . &quot;

rain instead of star @-@ ro@@ bs : hope of the weather
the weather has done the star @-@ beak @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany by the night for Friday - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was very suitable for the clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is meant to be good , then we see a lot of stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the stars , it is Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest stars . &quot;

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you have been ra@@ zed forever , at night , you have fallen asleep again at night , in the morning , it is far from wak@@ ing up to sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one encounters with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sle@@ ek and more than ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently being recovered . &quot;
how do sleep problems or inter@@ rup@@ tions ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes underlying them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , pre@@ dat@@ ors of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand it is , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so it is an input and a sleeping . &quot;
&quot; just that end many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , pre@@ dat@@ ors in the German @-@ medical association with practice at the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is it ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ical or hal@@ ogen @-@ related factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the inter@@ fer@@ ing expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wak@@ ing up is mainly due to depression frequently , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it may be that different factors would like each other .
&quot; who for example has a band@@ ed incident , can be bad , awake every two or three hours and cap@@ ur@@ ly bl@@ ur@@ ned to p@@ onder@@ ing over everyday problems and worry , there are we@@ ary an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when to go to a doctor with sleeping disorders ?
&quot; who has not sleeps over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , and the day is affected , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ying it . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment may be totally different : one is down@@ beat , tired , tired , im@@ pass@@ able , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or bodily discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to all@@ evi@@ ate the bed@@ ding , it is important to find its causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classical sle@@ ek @-@ coated tablets merely in the exceptional cases and no more than two weeks . &quot;
&quot; precip@@ ed dormit@@ ories can hardly be found in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the multi@@ disciplinary dormit@@ ory medical center of the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why one should first contact the primary physician at sleeping problems , betra@@ ying it . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with exam@@ inations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to the sleeping laboratory , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; to investigate the sleeping laboratory for medical devices , for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory disorders , with disease @-@ long @-@ res@@ ili@@ ence , at bed@@ time or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping sle@@ e@@ ability , declares . &quot;
for the investigation it is not necessary to prepare .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not have lunch s@@ lick , &quot; says Fic@@ tion . &quot;
after the em@@ bodi@@ ment one goes to his normal time in bed .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body you have a nose @-@ nose , a chest strap and a ant@@ enn@@ as at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling the sleeping places . &quot;
how can people affected the problems get a grip ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of actu@@ ators , where one can sleep for a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; We@@ ed@@ le counts on : regular dormit@@ ories and asc@@ ents , not too long in bed , do not sleep away to sleep , alcohol ste@@ els and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to convert immediately , and that is altogether not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming has to be
the former German swimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the D@@ SV @-@ team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he was taken in gold at the short @-@ way world championship for the first time - presenting his first world record at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler available via Facebook protective against his in the criticism of the former team mates .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ asi@@ eger 20,000 € premi@@ ums gets and a jungle of 150,000 € should no one be surprised about the medals there , wrote the 26 @-@ year old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the di@@ op@@ ing@@ Controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; this way , we cannot compete with countries which will promote a lot and do not see so carefully at the subject of dop@@ ing or even run it . &quot;
&quot; I am not saying that the controls are to be set here , &quot; said he continued . &quot;
&quot; wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how we should keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de of Car@@ th@@ iev@@ es arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil fighters of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police were successful on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed as a gang and bag har@@ ness .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 the civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a ban@@ ker again , which was known to police officer of past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the mid July of July , and were also common , labour @-@ minded , and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can be the di@@ ver , who entered into Germany for Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; with this , they had been a total of more than 15,000 euros exploited . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few l@@ air @-@ buildings , in the meantime a few l@@ edge @-@ paved road : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in appears at first sight not so , but the police counts it among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one walks along the east from the east to the west , one comes along the road places , a refreshing nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the fa@@ ç@@ ade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot;
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl which will also soon be demol@@ ished , it will be built already : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals . &quot;
&quot; article on this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property group is called peaceful sha@@ in , in the last weeks , however , preferred to be used with comb@@ us@@ tion vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents are rented apartments , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , H@@ enkel had spoken many times for a hard action of police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the spaces were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers and three teams on site , un@@ lock parts of the street and held visitors to visit the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of the un@@ familiar home@@ owners the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later moved police and workers under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects lie a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main objective of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the pine forest since 1999 , and Jana * , who draws here three children , especially from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the household projects , they share the concerns of rising hi@@ ring and customs . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a pine forest , who wanted to take part in a hei@@ gh@@ tening police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , the inner inter@@ c@@ ator and the police of the land@@ lords and their neighbours , does not appear to appear . &quot;
&quot; peaceful sha@@ ved in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today reached a lower level of average and high poverty of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; also the house @-@ occup@@ ations and the bor@@ ns work projects belong long to the area : 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied including the whole Main@@ zer road very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under large police series , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ net for tourists and choices around the world : with them now residents of the GDR and former house@@ wives are now sharing their p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this also makes it noticeable in the rental , which has increased for nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on fin@@ ite sli@@ ces , or fresh coated fac@@ ades , which were raised with colour@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this year , no other road was mentioned so often along with the words &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason that not all neighbours might regard this as problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury should be directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
most of the criminal off@@ ences make the damage they tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence is concerned , it is con@@ du@@ ci@@ ful : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who don &apos;t have been . &quot;
also the famous fl@@ amm@@ ers cars give it direct to the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her road is not a crime point on the contrary . &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to the rig@@ a@@ er Straße and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the inhabitants will return their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by sealed new buildings in former buildings which supp@@ ress the ancient residents . &quot;
&quot; these are still con@@ domini@@ um apartments which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well hidden , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot;
but what should one do when someone else listen to someone ?
&quot; there is frustration at all sides , even with the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for those drawn , who liked the bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the pine tree . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware - just like someone who moves to a pub that can complain bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons issued only with the first names have asked , not to be called by their correct name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organization .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee @-@ in@@ tee for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gues supported the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact person responsible for all players : refugees , Labor Party , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer from the Labor Party indicates that hon@@ orary posts is more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the eager w@@ ool @-@ mil@@ der , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less sp@@ ying than rather on the variety of tasks are targeted - meant as management wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; searched for a administrative power with a talent for languages and people , joined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a high @-@ quality w@@ ool @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as net labour . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position on three years of time @-@ term .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ e- and main actors supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and security problems . &quot;
soon new containers are facing the washing @-@ road
&quot; a grave problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting wing@@ lings that have been acknowledged . &quot;
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
you have to put refugees in their own or en@@ rolled living rooms .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility is moving from the land rat@@ ory to the Comm@@ une and J@@ ob@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed as very difficult for some time .
de facto government does not find private apartments .
&quot; it does not work so far it is not dependent on private apartments , so deu@@ cu@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community apartments must be settled , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the washing @-@ way .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed pen@@ be , there are internship places , training courses , training courses , A @-@ euro @-@ Jobs and for the persons responsible for refugees and migrants that have found or be set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help hous@@ ing@@ care , complete charitable work - and the motiv@@ ates and very tidy , like Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the Municip@@ ality leads to a positive effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
occupation : but not only work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and Kunde . &quot;
people need to develop an influ@@ encing feeling .
&quot; so do we need special offers such as sports , contacts with natives and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so also here administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are appreciated in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must declare the refugees that it takes time , and they can make them more meaningful , e.g. with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach nobody , should not work and be useless , which will never be integrated . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; but there is also , customers honestly say , &quot; people , where nothing works . &quot; the work of deu@@ cu@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two according to recent occurr@@ ences are afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; what would be nai@@ ve nai@@ ve . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko can and would not shut them out . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ per is already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in re@@ pu@@ te .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities . &quot;
they have always been in the background that soon a new Sto@@ cks of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
this is clear to answer this question is politics .
actually it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived at where we want , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already available , to integrate their current people . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in distress , they have to help them both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is as complicated , as there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : inhal@@ er with helic@@ opter sought
the police helic@@ opter flew approximately one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are penet@@ rated on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 p.m. by an apartment in an apartment house in the lens .
the inhabitants turned the two and hit the un@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were approximately 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 metres large , well mas@@ hed , both Blu@@ e@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis . &quot;
they travelled towards the city centre .
&quot; to the flag@@ ging police , the police took several strikes , as well as a police helic@@ opter . &quot;
the flag@@ ship was running out without success .
&quot; perhaps , the unknown before the apartment had been close to the apartment or during their flight . &quot;
