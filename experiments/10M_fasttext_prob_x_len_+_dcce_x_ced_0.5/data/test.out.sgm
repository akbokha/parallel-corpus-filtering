<seg id="11">He caused himself to lead himself with his family about the facility of the ALRV on a horse he didn't try to photograph himself.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for a long time, it was the first time in Aachen, and with it to CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was thoroughly convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe exceeded the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">"at awards, it does not lack the sympathetic athlete."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverkreuz, Silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and truffles in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and to prevent the TTP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"unone, however, the two US presidential elections are in the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"stretcher wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and warns before, as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators."</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wool to the economy of death and regulating death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"by contrast, he would be quite different, said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return regulators, and he sets off strong tax reform with lower control systems - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the contrary, says: the state has certain duties to fulfil; he has to open disadvantaged chances and needs money for that."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes for the rich would increase, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"to be invested in mts, Trump and Clinton is almost worshipped."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic elections announces itself the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nationalization Teachy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, we could have another internal discussion."</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly the differences in energy and climate policies are evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build power-fired power plants and restore coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas and will terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand its investment program explicitly and asks:" "a country will create the clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpacitive trade agreements, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US would not want to isolate the United States - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid for better than Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger diminishing.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must rump, then he says he could not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months might likely be likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics adhere to him, so that the budget deficit would only be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who want to demand at least by the rich, that they will pay more taxes, and their critics are saying: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who own alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">A has laid out her little son in the arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He shocked with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother goes on to the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">"until they realize, that it is observed."</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled short and kissing the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene appears normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is an area of business manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief offerings in Bavaria, and among other things, deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are whispered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in Münchner north, one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs' made the furniture together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: any woman who counts here, has made her flight experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hope to return to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women they overweigh other reasons for the flight:" "many steells themselves secretly, because they don't see another way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country, they have experience with sexual violence, compulsory, patronage, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"also here, women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and hardest."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to that about 90 percent of women who reside in the north in the Münchner north, appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not made voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were used to say that they are nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or she does not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they are often not going to help but need more accommodation only for them, urges Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven districts of refugees are responsible for the accommodation of refugees in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="38">"whether they knew about a similar project like Munich in its jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is such a thing in shelters of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabians alone, women are not separate alone, Karl-Heinz Meyer, Presespreach of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unter- and Mittelfranken can be found in some areas of floors or own homes for all women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accomodated separated by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study, which was published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are eliminated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"missing the privacy or become men and women together, it can come to - constantly - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and accessible to women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women felt in need of this protection, it is possible to read the crowds at the end of the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end of eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin made his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in receipt, I cannot confess the expression that Ankara wants to seize this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the envelope, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile, narrowed and he shining barely heat, even for his backward circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, he spoke to his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis, but could even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day I described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so that would never be anything bad."</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin-radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was deldiated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to put Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"this was even bigger, since it was committed by a alleged friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the Vetrust will rebuild it becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the nationally controlled media conducted a fierce attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed like the Turks would pay for everything to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious officials were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, have been controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting only took place because Putin was Erdogan on the apology who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire lie clearly on hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan takes first and foremost all the friends who can get after the last month at a weakened state of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him well.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - particularly prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late aisle of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week prediction the state telescope, cheap fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agrarian has been allowed again to be allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulating it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it was in response to the tried of power-over as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent Groll get on the worm's accession negotiations and Putin - the pike insists out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian state head won in Ankara with certainty for a bonus that he sought after the coup d" état support for elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-founded for Moscow, a matter of course, which even changed a deep-seated fear of regimp."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this bright Palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one of how it was once describing me an analyst," Alliance of outsiders ": two countries that have fallen out of the West and poorly dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest differentiation is Syria, where Moscow has recently been the role as a peace of peace, but where Russia and Turkey support."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks were told at the press conference, that they could not even engage the issue once more."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey rent it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to accentuate them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey crush Turkey into the Russian fighter jet, it certainly is better that the two heads of state will stand at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="7">A regulation is lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"member presidents of Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be chosen as social housing."</seg>

<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were built on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later this includes a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest from the release of the game in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand were slightly different."</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries has been moved by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon go to more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>

<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data to the auction.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health, who want to bring about 30 minutes to take" "take off" "from the sofa" and "to be active each day, because many public messages are boring to health and come to people who look like."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated."</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps with the weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>

<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are morific toys that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"if Smartphone Apps like FitBit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to push sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>

<seg id="2">An British empire subordinate his immune system and sausages of a serious test - by bringing some of the narrower and ecarest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and Reiseptor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk screened his course on the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the ablation of each object, he used an Luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to get into."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filtered under the title" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, to reject the dishwasher, that has already been used by thousands of others, may actually be completely repulsive, but actually in a kitchen washes more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he read, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by the world traveled, and peculiar and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations, up to sink of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told him:" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and flammon water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"now, what he did, was a filthy public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its propulling showed a luminometerisation of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison to this, the Luminomometer is freshly washed up less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject, after their Luminometeries over 4000 units was, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This comes to the worst, which I have matured in a restroom. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not check here anything because it is here penetrally.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish construction of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company stats Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus that contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vukovmaa says:" we wanted to offer the consumer a little new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy brainstormings through, which we ended, that we said" Lass us Ian call us. "</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how they are connected to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who introduced the film of the film, added:" let me lose my respect for Ian if he would have heard my respect for Ian if he had some of the things that I have dependent on him, just like the ekeldest Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring it to Ian and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we received some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of Valid conducted by 2015 associated 84 percent of all respondents, lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use, the U.S-acid bacteria included."</seg>

<seg id="11">In the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach during the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach. he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">"now, however, the most extensive ones are made."</seg>
<seg id="13">"some is already known, announced, profiled: that a new safety authority is to take care of the bucket, is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU guidelines for passenger data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of this is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also works unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And for some points - in the unequal treatment of gedulated for example - raises the question: what does this actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, it cannot be said to say that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people faced the great refugee concerns about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that deeply dealt with people at times, were not settled in the election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner security is enormous into the focus.</seg>

<seg id="40">We have not forged the discussion in Germany</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination tops: who does not buy record-boards?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely Men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you head to the commentary box to sow him under the alias of non-leather men with rough insults, this statement directs of up-to-date data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multidimensionable recovery process has not been due to a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all predictions under the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely cayey group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older record aisle keep their feelings more suitable for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend their time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But will the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest grey cascutter, before I stand, my hands, and a bit determining how:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos slowly introduced to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and farm."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (Datencount: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (data count: eight men middle age), a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have ca. 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records as they had appeared and again to buy objects that he sold, when he was young and plitude."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70s that was published than I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably somewhat young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy the plates, are more introverted and happy to spend time, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my lanster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers he meets to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people, who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have prompted to buy her old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have managed, people usually have done so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who were once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to recognize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers were incurred by the contentless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to revoke the stability of familiar battentions from objects that are more happy Jugenderinnings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors so and I think it is with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flees a employee of a record-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record, they have not yet been heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% possess a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who own a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I was petalled by a stack of the Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (a number of men: three men middle aged) has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," "I had no record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product lashing, less musiklasy."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who are getting to come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp that has dedicated the bump nearly a whole floor, has a bazed crowd when I re-going."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the standing-standing stores is - Wild Beasts, synthesizer and sextant pop in instead of experimental jazz drapes out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks sonically lonely, but nagging psychotic traumata are hard to be adjustable when you are standing next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around in the shop for a few minutes and looked at the variation of the equipment for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window of mortal-sleeves as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collection of plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from one computer or in another way but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record-lovers: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give to encouragement, the jeans-hotpants to muster, I observe a group of young teenage girls, grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter consider to be able to buy a crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to attach them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for this items could mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research inquiries made that the results of YouGov agree that the results of YouGov agree, at least in records in Soho, the large number of female collectors in Soho, who exist in reality, plate business and in Onlineforen, unconsidered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the leg of plate of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while having the rigid eye of an unfurtive, 30-year-old moderator meiden, who crosses nothing at the shoulders of middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came on Thursday night at a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were struck by a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage here in Rio."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotous gold than in these games and that will mean what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rowing back to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even though it was only the cones, which were on the ruin, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was all present as she sent to the second Olympiagold in the second without tax-woman in a row that laid out on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"your dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter would be uncompromised use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we are seeing are two brilliant athletes, who glide about the surface with the elegance of Sponges, which is not reflecting the type of triumphant too geese."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in the Rugs is a battalion, willing to make the difference and it was no one-known as the coach, which would not happen before 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all, when cancer was diagnosed."</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, who is operized and that they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty shlimme situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had luck that he could start at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, which could start the break at a minimum, in case that is not at all the right term."</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money so I had to go better with me soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the unilability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a rainy morning to talk something more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was considered principal mann at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan," I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"it just repeated, how much to me this means, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have improved a better person for traders or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark joined forces, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "abiding in the process, abiding in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not tear down.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not interested in doing something tacolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we wanted no fireworks, we just wanted a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">This would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympiasian."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"news-service information that were typically dismissed by high-level CentCom Commanders, reported regularly a positiverted image of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were all positive as analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering, if poor analyses of our political leaders are presented," held Ken Calvert, Republicanese Member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The managerial error in the CentCom reach up to the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-round report shows detailed explanations in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct reference to that government pointed under Obama statements, it shows how analyst exposed to the pressure from their pre-laws, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half year 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements from the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom invests publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosconss can begin already in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosconsul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>

<seg id="15">"the Republicans called the Task Force into Life, after they were played, that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detail findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additionally further investigation of CentCom reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee on Thursday released their own findings that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 the CentCom have created a limited process for the creation of impediments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest grade democrat in the Committee of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. ship," delayed the release of post-investigations reports, "ashamed the morality of analysts and" gave a little space for differing opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. ship and Democrats agreed not to have any references to an intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts in terms of a" specific political opinion "." "</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by the General Assembly of the Pentagon, which were recorded according to the complaints of CentCom Analyst."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a media preacher of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would have no reports of Congress while the investigation of the General inspector are still in progress."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also gave that" "experts sometimes thoroughly diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome the controversy of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">Investigation impacts on the question of a successful campaign campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"but the allegations of the last year have raised the question, how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest inspections of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State are reminiscent of more than ten years ago than a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writing about the recommendations of many analysts at George W. Bush contrary to the recommendations of many analysts in Iraq and took little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to provide government officials to have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terror group, as these temporary refining could have put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="7">"but in recent months protests against the government, the country and refused to spread out more and more territories."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week there were thousands of people on the streets and slowing fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to that policemen were shot on zig unarmed protesters and prayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"changing videos on the protests that probably are from the last or the beginning of this year, show such as safety people with pushers, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority of Human Rights is now asking for an introductory investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians, to fight terror over the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy has expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new finer train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to be repressed by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, whereby the governors were to be silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison or were driven to the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central-Ethiopians. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground-use to the stranglehold concerning the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widespread election of last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions walk along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this zakot, controversial line called for June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which were forced in recent years more or less imposed by turmoil and rearmament again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of prior to the surface now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media since cheaper smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even when the government uses access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, most importantly, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies who hide, where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians showed that they gathered so many protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons prosperied the Amharas, which come from etheric countries, in politics and economy, while the Oromos exploited, many of which are many Muslims and live in flat-land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, at the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebellion, was until his death at a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly versed in this, early signs of discontent perceive and non-contractors to process opponents and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyses. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopians new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively undisputed reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"other than Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of North-Ethiopians, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he has not received the confidence of the tigray controlled by the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia has been living such turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, according to the analyst of analyst apparently, and subsequently stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razors, many protested were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia leaders to their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new finite process, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misunderstanding of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the last month of attacked protested in Gondar, a amharous city, of Tigray guided shops and hatred towards the Tigray is getting more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests supported the USA and other western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American Government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronentrips beyond the neighboured Somalia, even though they recently said that it has closed this basis."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West will clearly support democracy, he does not want his foe collapsed in an already volatile area."</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy in Friday that his campaign surrounds him that his repeatedly repetitive claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not serious. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarifying these clarifications had raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Republican, whether he is able to communicate with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his supporters, who endeavour to take him during an uneventful phase, to explain in the actual position, declarations, that he might not have meant to be meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the confectionery of a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made reference to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the President and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he was simply sarkastical."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement, he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the Republican presidential elections wanted nothing to know."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the final storm of criticism prasselt down Mr. Trump, while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign due to decaying envelope to the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return again on this subject."</seg>
<seg id="12">"through Twitter, he thanked that Mrs. Clintons will bring suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to its defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism, when he said, the Russians should rejoice Mrs. Clintons Eemails, but he said later" "Natey, I said the sarkastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will arrive as they arrive and then if necessary," according to what the reaction falls. "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in a different way."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more engraved note because its circumstance has gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday showed a tour with great advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-an-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally attempts to unapologize for its provocative statements, he accused his critics frequently to crush his statements or his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is a focus of attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal co-strikes in the uncomfortable situation to be able to stand independently of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent Fürs were to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps, was asking if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton was founded in the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS I was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbone, completely false and therefore it came to pass the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream Republican attempt to argue that the government headed under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an external Secretary, it was allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressively to take control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them against each of his words and be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he burned the" poor, jämmerical "TV experts who try to understand it and said," You can't do it!. "</seg>

<seg id="8">"only when it reaches, speeds up the five meters long animal on satte 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">But this of the loneliness of life seems to be a patrol for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" Science "at least from Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity", "commented Alexander Schralein from Max-Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means for vertebrates a world record."</seg>
<seg id="12">"although, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland-haie are being painted."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only fails the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland is hard to watch, eventually they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the skinny coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in accordance with the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know little."</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timesupempo Maßen it when they used six animals with a transmitter equipment.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this haie yet: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remnants of a rub, another had shocked the jaw of a young ice-bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleeping-like animals or patrouilliers at the bottom of the ice cream and look at Kadaver which extends from higher water layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenlandhaie, the fisherman between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as a guide from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon-14 method the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyebinth is born already before the birth of the sharks, the characters contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a great deal of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1950s, as the Atomic-proliferation, bigger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in that with 220 centimetres length of the smallest animal, the lint-runs of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all the larger Greenland-haie had normal carbon-14 amounts, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon 14-clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland-shark showed a age of 335, while the record Hai with 502 centimeters can be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark can only get lagged when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length were able to assign."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably on the threshold to the sexually mature women and his age was determined with 156 years, Grönlandhaie become apparent at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">"also, this is likely to be the world record for spinal animals."</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusaleme live above all in vain waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland wal, whose bacon was put up a 120 year old harpostage, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperature, the organism also runs on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and alters slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep in the cold water warm, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface resulting from the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of the elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous, and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malware respond to current companies and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once, partially several victims of an attack with blackmailer software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany just 20 percent of firms were the target of a ransomware detection.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly the solvers demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their blackmailing-software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack on nuclear networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"are they successful there, the potentially cause-pressing ransom considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of damages," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, the perpetrators discovered extortion software for itself."</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private user was the target, but the transition to company attacking was carried out quickly during the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware operates after a simple pattern: once on the computer's computer, it looks after long-long changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as the archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the blackmailing list.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where with private users the personal photo database is on the game, we are dealing with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is tackled."</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher is the damage when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies raised sales growth by ransomware, 13 percent even had to complete operations completely, in case of a case people were living in life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of inacts."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, their data will get back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrator in the light of breastfeeding."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user area and contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they declare their victims by chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, free access sites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and we will redeem individuals after payments of only a few hundred euros, companies have to pay hard to negotiate and five-digit sums in order to withdraw their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the ransomware fatigue, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware around within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building at the actual blackmailing.</seg>

<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are entertained."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects lie a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main objective of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the pine forest since 1999, and Jana *, who draws here three children, especially from the police presence."</seg>

<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been vacated under large police series, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them before 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the city district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magnet for tourists and choices around the world: with them now residents of the GDR and former housewives are now sharing their pines."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this also makes it noticeable in the rental, which has increased for nearly 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on finite slices, or fresh coated facades, which were raised with colouring."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this year, no other road was mentioned so often along with the words" "linksautonome violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason that not all neighbours might regard this as problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury should be directed almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less spying than rather on the variety of tasks are targeted - meant as management wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for a administrative power with a talent for languages and people, joined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a high-quality wool-ups."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as net labour."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position on three years of time-term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle ehre- and main actors supported."</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and security problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are facing the washing-road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a grave problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting winglings that have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">"for the connection, the municipalities are responsible."</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to put refugees in their own or enrolled living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is moving from the land ratory to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed as very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto government does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it does not work so far it is not dependent on private apartments, so deucule."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, community apartments must be settled, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the washing-way.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed penbe, there are internship places, training courses, training courses, A-euro-Jobs and for the persons responsible for refugees and migrants that have found or be set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help housingcare, complete charitable work - and the motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the Municipality leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Occupation: but not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Kunde."</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop an influencing feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so do we need special offers such as sports, contacts with natives and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are appreciated in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must declare the refugees that it takes time, and they can make them more meaningful, e.g. with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not work in Urbach nobody, should not work and be useless, which will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also, customers honestly say," people, where nothing works. "the work of deucule and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two according to recent occurrences are afraid of radicalisation, also in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine customer says quite clearly," what would be naive naive. "a Restrisiko can and would not shut them out."</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helper is already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in repute.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new Stocks of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">This is clear to answer this question is politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived at where we want," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher are already available, to integrate their current people."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in distress, they have to help them both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is as complicated, as there are no simple answers."</seg>
