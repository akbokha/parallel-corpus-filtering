Obama receives confirmation
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and to oppose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; but in the encounter , it is also possible to investigate the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for many years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zed the long @-@ lasting settlement of Israel and Netanyahu lacks a lack of peace during the peace process .
&quot; by the deal acquired by Obama &apos;s deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relation of the two has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Netanyahu had had a debate on invitation of the Republi@@ cans , in front of the U.S. Congress , which was regarded as a per@@ ched against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the talk was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this time im@@ min@@ ent in Israel with a reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a call @-@ call , Professor , his girlfriend were shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon spoke with the faithful voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited is , and he said , the family contacts of dead wife could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials visited the ark of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ at and a hand@@ written note that was done on a white block : &quot; I just did it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . this was according to some of the authorities in the letter and he was signed . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississippi , already 300 miles to school grounds , where he was shot for information of the police a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , on the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ signed Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 6@@ pm .
he stated that he has made the fatal emergency call for after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took the life when the police picked him .
&quot; another day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers have continued to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details that were published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , told him to draw an image of an talented , but possibly a difficult teacher . &quot;
he said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in the Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , he said he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
he was represented in a written book written by himself in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both teach in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher has 17 members and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ ination about hass@@ le @-@ free behavior .
&quot; a student , brand@@ on Be@@ avers , the lam@@ b stated , he also seemed a little up@@ set and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told that lam@@ b told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and told that he has a health@@ sion@@ ist issue .
in this year he only administ@@ ered two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university so important that the promotion , for the Lamb , worked so hard for him , and represent no guarantee for an automatic response to an endor@@ s@@ ement status as assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; then President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was a kind of Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
this is why we cannot answer this .
after the flight from the campus the police took a lead later when he came back to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as imports .
&quot; before he was arrested , she served himself her home with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on driving .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b was at this house , but Johnson said that it thinks he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he &apos;s handed in 2009 to his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a town with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and studied Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he took his doc@@ torate in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term friends of Lam@@ bs drew him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 , when she met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her guitar . &quot;
at the time he was the woman &apos;s warm .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and du@@ st@@ deck were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the call , &quot; &quot; I did my wife &quot; , &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; you had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that was adjacent to one Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ce , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were left by 15 years ago , but friends were dead and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; Oh &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
he &apos;s represented in Pr@@ enti@@ ce when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came out two years ago both in a summer year .
&quot; later , they played together one or the other . &quot;
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sing her own music .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ce was a nurse , which worked for various companies online . &quot;
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ en@@ ders and sometimes shelter in The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted bar near the Gau@@ tier , said he &apos;s Lamb and pr@@ enti@@ ce Night in the night of 5 September , after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic harmon@@ iel in front of a spar@@ ky audience . &quot;
there was no sign of that something was not voting .
&quot; simply just a lucky pair , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the fri@@ dre@@ aming and jo@@ ked together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , the first semester @-@ term seminar and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , English @-@ professor at school . &quot;

&quot; this story has been corrected to rec@@ oll@@ ary that the police now says that he signed the emergency , and that lam@@ b referred to his not@@ ary ren@@ ame as his wife , but there is no indication of it that the two have ever been married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox Mar@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he told in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated cro@@ ws and an arm@@ rest of it , being with the Princess of Wales on one Date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ i and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;

&quot; it is really for me , &quot; said To@@ berg , &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ ous of the biggest festival movie , which has ever been shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October . &quot;
&quot; UN @-@ chief says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
&quot; Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military assistance for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Head once again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on the final solution of a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said to a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the annual general meeting held in Syria to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he depl@@ ores that the encour@@ agements in the Council and within the Syrian People and the Regional Po@@ wers &apos; are in@@ sol@@ uble to this situation .
&quot; in asking for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deadline with Iran . &quot;
8 ren@@ eg@@ ues indicating that Donald Tr@@ ump will take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
some have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how several Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks , in surveys using v@@ eys , it has not working ( yet ) . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range and some begin to ask yourself seriously what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of the real estate of Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody says that Tr@@ ump will probably gain the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that during this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys , was given guidance to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which none of which won only one state in the nom@@ inations process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ ar@@ oos Super P@@ AC and the conservative Group Club for Growth Hormon@@ es recognize Tr@@ umps and begin to let their dollars will flow to overthrow him .
here are some of the current transform@@ ations that suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
separ@@ ating popularity characteristics have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of ten Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
&quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa released last week , that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as a Candi@@ date .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ cans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be short@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; just two of 10 saying , they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he would be a candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son just creates the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same over Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; hardened &quot; , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used to critic@@ ises his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offen@@ ded statements , see 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans of the super@@ vis@@ ing Irish voters , that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , &quot; ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first pre@@ di@@ op@@ ed state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , 44 percent think he will not have the personality to effectively execute position , and almost six of 10 oun@@ ces say that his tem@@ per is not in the White House p@@ asse , as ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they stand up their return , Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination most often , according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a shift from the time when four out of ten came to put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ cans believed that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination with only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ umps campaign was viewed as plau@@ si@@ bly .
&quot; even when the Republi@@ can gathered to medi@@ ate a different candidate , Tr@@ ump still strikes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the spl@@ itter field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umps guidance , during the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support to diff@@ use more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump the majority business support . &quot;
&quot; he has gone from Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points Vor@@ sprung from , Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entre@@ pren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
&quot; a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they &apos;ve made their minds .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ tors , who support Tr@@ ump , say they have awarded their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change this , and no one can truly say to change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 per cent said they left the door open , to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is most powerful competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s Ben Car@@ son , but voters that have made their minds are twice as common to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of ten Republi@@ cans declare that they are in battle with Tr@@ ump in immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was presented two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum at the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic ex@@ h@@ ul@@ atively affected by the Republi@@ can party will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post card from Monday , six of ten Republi@@ cans report , that they are in line with Tr@@ ump for issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it will run by Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the frustration of the government clim@@ ates up to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son conf@@ ates some half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly through its out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of ten Republi@@ cans speak in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;

&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student service in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top spot , one of the price is like Pe@@ anu@@ ts before . &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ tro@@ l thanks to Müller and i@@ dol
two @-@ fold sc@@ orer in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller is just a run .
a happy tour of Thomas Müller played the way FC Bayern the way to a conden@@ sed 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereign player of the Champions League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have buried the FC Bayern in the Fr@@ ench@@ anted chair of Piraeus for a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; .
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola won her start @-@ game in the Champions League at the Greek rec@@ tor Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to rub@@ b@@ ish twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth anniversary in series shall be the first step towards the Fin@@ als on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where guar@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich in the third try . &quot;
Müller took place in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s Con@@ duc@@ tive Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which took a fl@@ ank crossing the master &apos;s victory .
&quot; we will not be under@@ estimated , was promised Bavaria &apos;s captain of L@@ ame in front of the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis &apos;s stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the coin held here . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and engaging concept without sh@@ iny .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six sport @-@ games in the Royal Class , including the well @-@ known clubs as Manchester United , V@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 attracted also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els had been defeated with Greek teams , they didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
they were cour@@ ageous with their aggressive effort but often too resour@@ ce@@ ful .
the attacks were introduced often by play@@ back on Link@@ En@@ ders Douglas Costa that was rarely used against the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had right more luck than his side fl@@ ank out of the right half @-@ field in the left corner of the tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ g@@ ye Brown the head@@ ball of Poland proposed by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by direct transfer , the go@@ alie Roberto with the kne@@ es ( 35@@ 05 ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria was used to dom@@ ed the usual game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to appoint Piraeus . &quot;
but on the keeper Manuel Neu@@ er it was Lost .
&quot; for example , as he gave a shot of ide@@ ye over the len@@ ght ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Guardi@@ ola had a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ res , sat at first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given only after the completion of gre@@ gate , said Sport@@ forum Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else of it , this is a mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he carried away from King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the starting Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; tin was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) , and made 13 minutes later everything was clear , with El@@ f@@ meter no Müller on display . &quot;
in front of the game it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ ah .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly ho@@ urs@@ ed Bayern @-@ fans in their spect@@ ators pointed out the tr@@ ailers of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and ges@@ tures , attacked the security forces and went on with a fl@@ ashes against the coin . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was eliminated from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth . &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not just cause the lungs but also the teeth , which places a sky@@ line of long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : during ren@@ unci@@ ation lo@@ wers the risk fast .
smokers have a much higher raised risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to smokers it was no risk to lose their teeth , in order to lose the 2,5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the researchers had observed more than 23,@@ 000 participants . &quot;
nomin@@ ee for bal@@ dness : car@@ ies and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va ; stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking a risk factor imposing the authors .
the relationship between smoking and loss may therefore go back to more frequent br@@ ums and smo@@ ker .
&quot; not clear , but smoking also raises the risk of tooth dec@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; people who ce@@ ased with smoking might reduce their risk but within a short time , they write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; it can take more than ten years until the haz@@ ards go back to the level of NON @-@ divers , Mr. Thomas Diet@@ rich said by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince people of that which are non @-@ smokers to become non @-@ smoking , &quot; &quot; said H@@ einer Boeing for the DI@@ f@@ E &quot; &quot; smoking also shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not to smoke is good for gr@@ unge and vessels , and leads after our findings also to a good dental health through to a high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population affected by the age of 65 to 74 years were affected by TH@@ AT . &quot;
previous studies have already advised that smoking increased the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study em@@ w@@ eth the findings .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; to overthrow the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between superi@@ ors and states are thus to be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way it works significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; we want to establish a system that tr@@ auen Citizens &quot; , &quot; declared the Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the idea . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish Commission has to put the proposal as a European negoti@@ ators on the Free Trade Agreement with the US . &quot;
the German Government announced .
&quot; through TTIP , the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world arises with about 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings clearly show that EU countries and the US are jointly select independent judges for a new investment .
&quot; it is intended to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
this is also intended for the first time in a second instance .
they would allow it to raise up against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; so far , the procedures involved belong to among themselves with arbitr@@ ator , in@@ consistency against their jud@@ g@@ ments were not there . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not engage the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fairness and justice , Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; over the long term , it wants to hin@@ ge its own information on an international investment course . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investors ( IS@@ DS ) must also be regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against the TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als will be cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a form of parallel tax , on the companies of damages , tax payers , or reduce national laws , or reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
in the first statements the anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act has been the proposals of the European Commission than inadequate .
she was particularly critic@@ ised for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already controlled free trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mahl@@ i ( SPD ) spoke the plans for the other hand as great progress .
the Commission considered the reform essential points of the Federal Bureau of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als should be taken from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association for Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against the economies of the economy by too many new rules . &quot;
especially small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; when the talks about the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , on Wednesday it remains unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this deadline is considered no longer cl@@ able .
Del@@ ik@@ h Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart to which the shy acting Fol@@ ders incur@@ red the picturesque US @-@ state Michigan with a pen@@ cil .
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost exclusively from St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the things on the basis of several places , which he always featured on the map , what about his in@@ cis@@ si@@ ously and delicate songs talk . &quot;

&quot; in his productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens also serves exclusively on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic security . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broadly orchestr@@ ated , but carried from programmed sequences or stress , and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ d at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ d is expected to host the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour Minister Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should state his debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and brought him to David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask Mr Cor@@ by@@ n to post the first of his six preliminary questions shortly after lunch with his performance by the media probably and by the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly meeting .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , for it came after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ et and his speech made on the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leaders has jump@@ ed on Tuesday during the singing of the National Park to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence and stands at the center of several introduction pages in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not to sing the National Park , has attracted attention . &quot;
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n he said he was &quot; respectful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the UK @-@ Chairman of the Labour leaders to sing the National hy@@ m@@ n , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns of peak class , and they were called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a Six@@ th of the Par@@ li@@ ary Party originally supported him as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , &quot; following Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements about the European Union &apos;s position and the limit . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C @-@ Conference that Labour votes to pre@@ ach to remove the entire idea of any limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow and pensions , pointed out that the party is &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26,@@ 500 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader who David Cameron , since he &apos;s T@@ ory boss , has since been across the Dis@@ patch box in the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy approach , says that he made &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 inspiration . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister has to con@@ front@@ ational and that he will be maintained both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the str@@ ay with resistance , and instead , to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Mr Lau@@ by@@ n said that Angela eag@@ le will represent him if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally seize the word and that he was John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sub@@ house , raised to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; he was elected leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron wants to remove himself from the policy of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; that is often linked to the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . but some years later he took place that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was sent on television in 1990 , the question was seen as the principal Bar@@ ometer of the jud@@ g@@ ator and his leadership in the House of Commons and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his Par@@ isi@@ ans , although critics argue , it became a caric@@ ature and printed voc@@ alist reforms . &quot;

pound grows due to accelerated growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rose to data , showing an increase in wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the results of no bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same level of the previous year .
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage had been the fastest and led @-@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents over the time of interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was clim@@ bed up to 75 % compared to the Euro to 1.9 % . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 13 % on 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after acquisition of ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands like Bud@@ ger@@ ators , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; Bur@@ berry @-@ shares were for encouraging messages from the competition @-@ group for luxury estates , up to 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ aut &apos;s newest sales numbers mean all expectations and demonstrated that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - will be sto@@ cked again .
&quot; shares of Glen@@ core @-@ expands by 5 % , after the Berg@@ bau@@ ri@@ ese said he has taken 2.5 billion $ through a share of shares as part of his strategy of debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and pap@@ entity in MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , namely with a decline by 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s got his estimate for the company rating on &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.8 % , after the Sport@@ be@@ et company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46,@@ 6 million . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; requires more purchasing power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers .
&quot; but it was unlikely that these buy @-@ power will be the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could affect expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings Leb@@ anese and potato chips
potatoes or gi@@ ver ?
it is both - and in the potato hill@@ er that has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger land@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch potato instead of don@@ er on a poster the PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A movement has put Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer
the idea brought him a poster with a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the heading &quot; potatoes instead of don@@ er &quot; that he happened to be on television .
&quot; since then , there is a bar@@ be@@ que area in its shop which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; that is multic@@ ultur@@ al for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has now to enter the Leb@@ anese with the patent office in Munich .
&quot; here , according to the authority of the Authority , it has recently been protected as the pre @-@ Pur@@ ch@@ u@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to bet@@ ray this . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes altogether even better , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;

cash cash starts at the Con@@ fir@@ mer &apos;s campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - income
cash cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ alen in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale distributor Met@@ cash has launched a Con@@ fir@@ mer &apos;s campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di opens the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ Super@@ markets strengthen its relationships with local food suppliers and commerci@@ alization by mainstre@@ am media marketing and commerci@@ alization via social media outlets , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ traders and supplier jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ l S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough that will be distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ Shops and shop@@ ke@@ epers , which sell tickets for the South Australian Football Bundes@@ liga to loyal clients . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to make a cash further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investors strategy . &quot;
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia fast 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ oos Ig@@ A @-@ shop @-@ shop make up and higher profit mar@@ gins as a met@@ cas@@ oos Ig@@ A @-@ network in the east @-@ States .
&quot; currency in South Australia and Western Australia represent a much stronger market share in South Australia , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia , and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to 14 percent in East Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ al@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets , roughly five percent of the food market in these two states will cut away and all the existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up to 25 transfers in SA and 30 in WA , and will win a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and grocery store and the quantities to Met@@ cas@@ st of high fixed cost could be cash to some 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ allic purchase shares in the eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan took place that Ig@@ A @-@ Buy now is the most demanding . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley acknowled@@ ges that met@@ cas@@ oos are selling at the food and grocery stores by 3.8 percent in 2017 and increased from 14 percent in 2018 and will reduce the share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business eating in Melbourne that metal should probably disappear inside a decade . Met@@ allic will disappear . &quot;
cash regi@@ sters is to react publicly on the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ allic with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has been contacted . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As Market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ oos , food and food trading , such as 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer , has decreased by 43 percent , which is reflected in high @-@ time pressure on sales and mar@@ gins since 2012 . &quot;
the wholesale distributor re@@ vered and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to provide sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products each week increasing and Ig@@ A ret@@ ailer to improve their stores by faster growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private @-@ label food products .
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ oos main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice is said to provide the price customiz@@ ations , and loading programs to é@@ ve and hopes that the wholesale distributor will return in 2017 for the first time in four years to gain a profit growth . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis Association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves a view of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ te@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is again named &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , &quot; gr@@ ated by the in@@ famous composition of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison that Har@@ rison had called : &quot; Li@@ wr@@ inka would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; at last he was seen how he fought a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp cut a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet seen , was defended by Heal@@ y &apos;s by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to make second place in the single @-@ year behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I have quite exciting , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the war , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat , as he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has responded in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison , and so on , and I think he earned much appreciation . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I think he was a little stern . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adap@@ ts to the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is doing well in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in important decision @-@ decision whether the Friday begins , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm feature to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all the controllers around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I believe that Nick was very quick to raise the rise of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray made . he goes out in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him , we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spot@@ light where he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency closing the border to refugees
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ pe the border line with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all firm that sought to get illegal into the country . everything with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants were accumulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
&quot; people who have been flying before violence have been set up for a unknown period of land on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries , and built tents , and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ g@@ ations stick to .
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter above them we@@ ave the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; and sm@@ u@@ ded insul@@ ts against the Hungarian provisions . &quot;
some showed protest food and water back .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers declared it , &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collective .
&quot; in the coming days talks are held with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations block with a strict meeting in Brussels failed to agree with a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who would initially visited Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that ultimately - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would suggest that the EU states more 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a Special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes for an immediate action of Brussels or her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , not@@ ated in two southern regions gave authorities more substantial powers to get out of the crisis , so they could accelerate streets and kill asylum . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country seeks to build a spur to Romania along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after ending a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Club D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ bonds in the race , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence constructed between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East for a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic migrants are , who are seeking a better life - and not war people , are entitled to protection - a view which is strongly in contradiction with other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed by midnight in Hungary in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the sh@@ ame@@ ful of the 4 meter ( 13 feet ) high r@@ ents that allowed the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also specify higher yiel@@ ds for distributed human ret@@ ailer . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of state , &quot; said president of Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ ac re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : irregular border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military , who is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press released hard at the border to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities are 45 people when attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 other had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they get down , sh@@ ame@@ ful by damage to the fence , and are now accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are helping to fix the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning also two of the seven bor@@ ou@@ ghs with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed @-@ wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos caused the main bor@@ der@@ s@@ crossing close by Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and thr@@ ust a crowd in order to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 I managed to go down , but thousands were outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse to travel food and water until they go to Hungary . &quot;
choice @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton Pre@@ head before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit leap in democratic race in the democratic race at the national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will be gaining ground in front of the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , whereas the second is in second position , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not proclaimed whether he has entered into the Pres@@ idential Office , given support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters declare that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supports in their choice as those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost some of demo@@ graphic groups , while some wins some wins . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is holding a large lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have reduced . &quot;
&quot; your support in the men is lower , and s@@ anders will only be back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons benefits are fle@@ eting for democratic voters under 50 years , and are now on equal foot@@ ing . &quot;
Clinton had a big advantage with the older voters .
&quot; last month the Clinton had a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections were far said that they would like to support the Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some advantages and further 15 percent they would only support because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons of current supporters is especially inspired by her .
the views are more mixed with those that don &apos;t support him - just about a quarter would thoroughly support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters would say , Clinton to support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters this over their peak @-@ oriented Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons are asked in an open question why they want them the nomin@@ ee is , is the most common answer that she is the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; provided by Clin@@ tons , Clinton is also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with problems and elec@@ torate will also be cited . &quot;
&quot; since the Vice President Re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ as@@ et , 57 percent of the democratic voters gave him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; by recommen@@ tons &apos;s followers , more than half of them would have been far ahead of their second choice . &quot;
&quot; decides to nomin@@ ee bi@@ den , not for nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton tons in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the competition on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this number of 78 percent declined in the past month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage appearing as the &quot; most sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters ask questions concerning the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single European candidate or potential cont@@ candidate for these voters have emerged as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates have achieved good results in key characteristics of their party &apos;s pre @-@ elections .
&quot; ambig@@ u@@ ties , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds cuts the three candidates best for honesty , while Clin@@ tons strength is the leader . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters believe not that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections , in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion from proposition . &quot;
&quot; since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton to have continued the use of a personal e @-@ mail address and one server during the term in office , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are content with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions as a whole . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; now half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said their views have still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of her party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them under listed elec@@ torate , only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote hold them not for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled f@@ ake land@@ wide go far also Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes with guidance . &quot;
&quot; given the six tested candidates bi@@ ds , Car@@ son and Bush best for honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards reading , rather as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have the opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters with the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is close to a survey conducted by Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is just behind the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates have now been deb@@ ated by supporting voters in the new pol@@ l - and others have a dramatic impact .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month to 27 % in survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son stayed at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son is well sto@@ cked at demo@@ graphic groups and tr@@ ump between Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ an Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen by 10 % support last month on now 2 % . &quot;
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush the former Gover@@ nor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located with 6 % on the third rank .
the bug@@ ging of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which has been published last week , shows that Car@@ son is increasing to the surveys - he donated by 19 % support in the republi@@ cans , behind the dump of 32 % . &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed br@@ ump especially before Car@@ son .
&quot; facing one last week in Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side@@ ways to visit the former neurolog@@ ist , even after Car@@ son has ap@@ olog@@ ised to question Tr@@ umps believes in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaign appearances in Io@@ wa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern side is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if top values are measured only in the distance , enough for bath@@ ers have already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in north or Baltic sea is likely to have a more short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to the sea : maximum 18 degrees the water in the north and Baltic Sea , this week , shares the German weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bath @-@ temperatures still offers the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
in the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in France and around the world .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ otherhood charged with the death of a Cl@@ oth College
&quot; nearly two years after a student during a dor@@ sal ritual , one student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be filed against for five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood took off &quot; Den@@ g &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brutal to its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; officials spoke he was charged with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field at a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. think@@ g normally said about head@@ aches , then he fell mind @-@ heal@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Br@@ otherhood does not rie@@ ve the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g &apos;s power@@ less and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms g@@ goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national President of the Br@@ otherhood , to include Council , said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Chris Wagner in a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point , the members , to hide control and distor@@ ted the good of the Br@@ otherhood , basically about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ signed Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ve and he died next morning to his wo@@ unds .
&quot; after a Aut@@ op@@ screen , Den@@ g is repeated with st@@ umps on the head , h@@ ull and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sli@@ cks of the Br@@ otherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the ship , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe was an indic@@ t@@ ment for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ hundred members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also being charged with discrimination and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially , we will also call it to account &quot; , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood led its affili@@ ation to the town group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; Zin@@ c , and land@@ se will come into the sle@@ ek , and return for bonds will asc@@ end , and the economy is gli@@ ding into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it takes and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only small guidance on how to do this process . &quot;
a recession came under just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve take preced@@ ence of interest rates is often , alb@@ eit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial markets are responding . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have therefore emphas@@ ised that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed to norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
in the end market participants could find however seen that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a fork @-@ estimated .
&quot; the first boost in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted from some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; budget &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we expect not the gradual return of US interest to normal places , but still at a lowest level to fear for sei@@ sm@@ ic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
however this does not mean that there will be no consequences .
&quot; here , an overview of historical trends are based on how some areas of the economy might react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of zinc @-@ caves has to make things vol@@ ati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase is made , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seem seems to be a tendency to dimin@@ ish our wealth of 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may perhaps be rel@@ ayed the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study , which happens after C@@ ed C@@ ed C@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is mostly in advance during the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to fork etching , rather flat in the past six months after a current analysis , Bob D@@ oll , chief issue of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , with Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares appears to occur later in the Enh@@ ance cycle and the return begins to decrease .
Rez@@ essions are a fact of economic survival and interest @-@ accounts they often promote .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not previously exist and we could accelerate a recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point in a fork @-@ enhancing the F@@ ed will be .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent in 2015 , expect that this will last and expect the third quarter to collect data from Atlanta F@@ ed at just 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest esc@@ ort in such a fragile economic setting would be risky and take the question as if it is different for this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the market participants agreed to a Zin@@ tion of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many stra@@ at@@ ees and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a lik@@ eli@@ hood of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all contribut@@ ors of 1950 to today have taken place in a Super @-@ cycle with increasing emphasis on GDP and on @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months so far .
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market is taking an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the action at bonds can be faster than at shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; bonds bonds , the rendering seem to change , as soon as the first raising / lowering in the cycle appear . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the c@@ aster cycle , the app@@ endi@@ ces fall immediately , told the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believing that the increase in the interest rates will cause that Ren@@ di@@ tions bring closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; bonds can often bring better income in such a climate , although we still are w@@ ary to expect higher yiel@@ ds , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , says Jones , that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy needs . &quot;
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indication that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield of loans have increased , and the vol@@ ati@@ lity still increased - everything characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensified their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and globally competitive companies that benefit from the greater part of their operations in the United States , if interest rates get rising and local products are attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are worse off because an increasing number of dollars is becoming more expensive on the global market and just as financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares are extremely positive to respond three months after an initial interest rate in a positive way , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ analy@@ st in a report for customers . &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a growth balance in its interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital yield and lower vol@@ ati@@ lity in their stocks , even beyond their counter@@ parts , with lower quality by average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot;
debts will be a big issue .
businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose .
&quot; outside of the pure stock of stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; spar@@ ity could see profits through higher yiel@@ ds , even if experts from different opinion are how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , said Par@@ a member Andrew Bin@@ gham
&quot; the Conserv@@ atives of the Parliament strongly cri@@ tici@@ zed the sender because of his &quot; &quot; diges@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not to be distinguished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just The Br@@ its
colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins update the Voice of The Voice and said that this was not quite original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliament and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , prove that he does not do anything that the private station will not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ atives of Andrew Bin@@ gham , said : &quot; &quot; the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses said that the public @-@ Legal &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly shall no longer be distinguished from his commercial it@@ ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;d like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr Bin@@ gham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate , refers to the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial cont@@ en@@ ders , when it comes to live music and intelligence . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is un@@ matched .
&quot; and the engagement of radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that it was harder to work hard to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was , however , not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports were rub@@ bing the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins hold the Voice of the BBC Voice - the musical talent Show at BBC - which was bought by Dutch manufacturer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of 22 million pounds .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he wishes to be that the company can &quot; &quot; a hit &quot; &quot; of our own barn , &quot; when it is the next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money of en@@ posting for other sub@@ ordinate formats . &quot;
Internet revenues in August at the slower and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent rise in online sales .
in the last month the lowest score for the beginning of the records in 2000 has been the lowest point since the year 2000 .
online sales intensi@@ fication three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shop
experts believe that black Friday in November has slo@@ wed down the money
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping is bath@@ ed , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into ho@@ stage cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that on line turnover , after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; overall expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase in comparison with the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are indications that on @-@ sales will begin speaking after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , then it has become ever evolving over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; he stated that the online sales intensi@@ vely increased three years ago , as a buyer began to make purchases with their mobil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the couch . &quot;
&quot; but now it comm@@ utes this , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the decre@@ asing order .
&quot; experts believe that buyers can hold their purchases in this event , each of the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; in the past year five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some ret@@ ailer sites transi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that black Friday , in which the buyers would be cl@@ ashed against bar@@ gain , buyers that it could hold acquisitions . &quot;
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was sold out by 5 £ spending a little more than 1 £ .
&quot; with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are made available via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time it bu@@ ys more than a quarter of men &apos;s clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores .

&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have opposed the arm of the crane as he did not use . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the Dec@@ ree , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Gruppe was held responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported that detail not , but stated that the management of the company were traveling alone . &quot;
&quot; this week Sal@@ man praised sal@@ ute , which caused the overthrow of the sick , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the p@@ add@@ ling that takes place later this month , gathered together in this month . &quot;
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Gruppe has no statements about the collapse of the Crane and their representative were not at your disposal for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they have not co @-@ operates with mete@@ or@@ ologists .

&quot; that leads to that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at cra@@ ftsmen , are opened &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q stores are close to King@@ fis@@ her
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that British are holding their h@@ amm@@ ers , and brus@@ hes in favor of the use of qualified European trad@@ es@@ men who work in their home . &quot;
if you are being sent with a hammer or a brush for increasing cri@@ tically as they seem to be apparent to a minority .
&quot; for the British employ an increasingly professional trad@@ es@@ man , to carry out do @-@ it jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets , said that a large increase in the number of skilled professionals from Eastern Europe , offer services at low prices and in the meantime over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her intends to open for 200 further pres@@ tr@@ fix shops , which connect to cra@@ ftsmen and 60 sales places of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q Shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women .
for the moment they weigh the men .
&quot; said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this into a balance stronger .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry that one of only five women listed at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed by a leading number of men and women in leadership positions to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only enterprise , who has occupied just 50 per cent of the teams , including his management and financial support . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her announces a drop in half @-@ year @-@ appearance and in@@ serts after the group off the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; the trends King@@ fis@@ her , Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up to 200 new branches . &quot;
functions of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
&quot; at the National Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt , the Wednesday two functions of the Austrian volleyball manager A@@ I / DO@@ B had to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ ks . &quot;
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them had been charged with abuse of abuse .
from this post he has been legally spoken in May .
the current process has been postponed .
&quot; according to the state @-@ state @-@ state Robert Ri@@ ffel in 2006 , the accused had fallen out in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of association accounts , about which they were dispos@@ ed in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
the damage occurs with around 400,000 Euros .
the sport @-@ Func@@ tion@@ aries are also charged with financial costs .
&quot; this fact was the Chairman of the chief lo@@ ats , the judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , from . &quot;
it is meant to be a later date .
&quot; to the design of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that the association did not constitute an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports thought would have been compens@@ ated and for the Sport@@ club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which it had invested a great deal of time and money from debt - the passi@@ va em@@ ailed in 2001 around 600,000 Sch@@ illing ( about 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing outside the situation : do we continue to wage the club or lock it up ? &quot; , &quot; he told one of the def@@ endants , in the treas@@ on of finance . &quot;
his colleagues and co @-@ accused did then decide to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have raised funds in our life insurance policies as a certainty in the bank &quot; , &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association had been agreed : you can manage the money , there are only no debts . &quot;
&quot; further be - in the proportionate financial success , the payout of the performance @-@ compens@@ ations was rejected by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one has paid some extent of the number of charges for years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
therefore also l@@ ump sum and not detailed ab@@ outs explained the former Ob@@ vice explained the processes .
&quot; the accounts and comm@@ ent@@ books managed the two def@@ endants in common , the second indic@@ tee said . &quot;
why the payments of the association were not detailed and asked to ask the judge .
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial aid , but only the debt of debt have been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , as in 2011 , against the executive com@@ missions due to abuse of abuse , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the network account . &quot;
&quot; he would have been in@@ appropri@@ ations , the accused . &quot;
&quot; this account was carried out on the name of the second def@@ endants and , according to whose statement , the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
&quot; finally he said , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor introduced into the room . &quot;
the con@@ ferred should have been informed and justified by the functions of the function .
this bank was formulated as &quot; claim &quot; in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
why harm ? ? wanted to know spec@@ ter and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; he said the first indic@@ tee , he was not agreed with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been ar@@ isen . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional cause , he never referred to a cent salary , even calcul@@ ates he only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; besides di@@ ets , he added to the association 1,000 euros a month , the actual effort was however much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years expressed the accused .
&quot; these are based on a audi@@ tory , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer preserved , explan@@ atory them . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also referred to the second indic@@ tee .
&quot; all homes be made in cash , in addition to that he had to go to the bank of his place of living in the bank to the lead pen@@ alize , stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard Development is another 30.000 Jobs

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non@@ violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has used at the Ser@@ b border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ mann against several hundred thousand outlets .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has witnessed the limits of violence at the border inspection point .

&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began with stones , st@@ akes and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;

the time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. Bank
&quot; the world has been observed if the US @-@ Not@@ en@@ bank arrived on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether the interest is lifted on for nearly a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ asked of Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will keep some longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,25 percent will last . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event because there has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest is NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach one of the situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and laun@@ ches a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Martin U@@ tility , Lei@@ tronic employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude views of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she has warned the markets to put on an increase , but the signs suggest that chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 o &apos;clock on Thursday
Cas@@ ual sc@@ orer at the Delta State University left no excuse
&quot; after the sho@@ ot@@ ings and the kill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi ended on Monday morning and before he later he wrote his colleague , he wrote Sh@@ annon &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it in@@ conceivable , &quot; &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that the Do@@ er &apos;s teacher for Ge@@ ography and Social Science at the Delta State University , called on the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he p@@ oured over someone and killed someone . &quot;
he &apos;s staff &apos;s staff spoke that police police officers delivered to his home police officers .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I am making my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but who will not distur@@ b , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he did not deliver him . &quot;
he &apos;s no explanation of his shots .
&quot; elected as police on the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , the said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note stood 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he served E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as police officer killed him . &quot;
&quot; then President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was a kind of Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , which was supposed to believe that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &apos; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was taken by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was approximately seven years married as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were after 15 years ago , but friends remained . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ce would have a daughter who is 19 and was destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ce was his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; prot@@ agonist worked online from home , according to testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of pr@@ enti@@ ers at the Sun Her@@ ald . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ce , who poss@@ essed a dog called Light@@ ning , she met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that he was called into prison at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; he took him to the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , ran into the woods and k@@ ills themselves with a shot . &quot;
he &apos;s handed over from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 as his life c@@ um on the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can play a long @-@ month basis for double @-@ acting frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w out@@ let the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven won a double frac@@ ture in its right foot .
&quot; while this has brought the left side def@@ ender to wines and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is not giving hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season again . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w were in the PS@@ V region .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double pin image and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes up with 18 to Manchester United , it very difficult and then fantastic , and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen @-@ mask on .
he cri@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the suspension of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli the Arb@@ it@@ ration , the Mex@@ ic@@ ans not pun@@ ished . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ rators has chosen to be mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now , I come back more quickly . &quot;
acting about : Manchester United encounter the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of the PS@@ V
the UK @-@ def@@ ender has an added incentive with the European Championship in France with an additional incentive to recover at least until the next June .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , The PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very cr@@ lim@@ me injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves this kind of injury the place , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
&quot; Moreno suffered a break @-@ break when Mexico was playing against Van Ga@@ al , The Netherlands team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he does very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you hear it is a very silent injury , this is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was gone into another direction , so it looked like he was touched him , but I could not see the attack upon Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado brought into hospital in the hospital - according to a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost entirely . &quot;
&quot; unless you know , you might be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; asked to be asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite pedi@@ gree , decided to become the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ label of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to pre @-@ read my children , as it always seems to have a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron want to describe the stor@@ y@@ line of the book , instead , has followed a summar@@ izing the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; surrounded by the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a good , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , met , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel lau@@ ts and the 1991 died , but is completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that were not suspected enough : the text presented by Cameron presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is ad@@ mitt@@ edly to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the act of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ ben@@ evol@@ ent boy , like the local environment by the gi@@ eager , trees , adul@@ ter@@ ous creatures , who talks in the name of the trees , &quot; bl@@ az@@ ed . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task would be deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax has not read for a child at a time in a child .
a down@@ ing @-@ street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons ballo@@ t office .
&quot; Campbell &apos;s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but was no further direct comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion of England &apos;s team but it is still very difficult
&quot; att@@ ain@@ ted to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the cad@@ res , the England responsible for the tour , there is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my card . &quot;
I would not ex@@ clude an down@@ ward .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site is perhaps less experienced than those three years ago , but there &apos;s good spin @-@ players in the Bat@@ ting setup and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ring of 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developed as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
in this news : Adam Ly@@ th resign@@ ed from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader in and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th om@@ draws , is of course for me as his boss @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ sten@@ et@@ te@@ ers are directed towards results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ inations , since - and I told that - players are their own best . &quot;
&quot; long ago it could have been extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
if he hopefully takes further loans for Yor@@ k@@ shire it seems another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss commen@@ ced his attitude , even though he did not get such good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test formula gets to put his banner , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - he was nine .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance to do @-@ it @-@ up and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation which one can rise up was that England initially appeared in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance now lies in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales actually comes in and it is a stroke I highly value .
&quot; he is an X factor of cri@@ mp poker player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very well . &quot;
&quot; it must obtain at least the same opportunities as before him , but of course it depends of the cre@@ ws in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let Mo@@ een adjacent to Cook , which would furnis@@ h a gradual spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four qu@@ ests were obtained , and I did nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not hit there , and this link @-@ handed has shown already that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he joined them as Open@@ er . &quot;
he immediately made three hundred concerts immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my tight contact with him he impressed me as a young man .
&quot; people may see their statistics on - average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of back@@ ers who raise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth . &quot;
on this tour he will learn a lot .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions in the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Hum@@ awar@@ , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys in the game , which is bringing a wealth of experience since it has played amongst all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
&quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives to the white bul@@ let stage , and brings energy and powerful use to the setup process . &quot;
&quot; I always felt that he has been created for the international cri@@ cket match , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the news is in line with the previously mentioned ones . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and Team@@ ach@@ ers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you will have to think that as with the players hin@@ ge their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made up in a light heart .
&quot; the Bre@@ xit option ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could be gained on the supply , if the economy by 2017 is built in a dol@@ ent device &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced gender @-@ operation strategy to hold Britain across the EU will get deeper into difficulties with every day , even without the choice of geni@@ y Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , which was fur@@ ious at least because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
immigrants also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ats quickly says that some member states are deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own fault , Great Britain himself , asked - with ges@@ ted conc@@ essions and disturbing States changes they are usually not going to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C I chose its annual general assembly , that it may not be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing their social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers are competing in meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a picture of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European boyfriend , who wishes to look outside the UK outside of the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and has long passed that there are more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t care whether we remain or going . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it is bad for her , as it is done with the exagger@@ ated long ten@@ ants like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending force .
Poland has soon become a nation@@ alist right government in Spain one left .
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they are getting a bone to decide to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy being better , Scotland &apos;s resign@@ ation from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; hence , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally un@@ inten@@ tionally do not help un@@ utter@@ ly notes , throughout the SN@@ P @-@ style , while the British referendum acceler@@ ates 2017 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was one gesture , &quot; and &quot; Britain has won &apos;t win anything of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how it can be black@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street to its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , however , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n inspiring Spe@@ yer in 1975 but did not support our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember weak at Boris Johnson , the First @-@ euro opportunity , who made a name for himself as a &quot; EU @-@ talk ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ years . &quot;
&quot; in all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; to do so , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing cup@@ boards , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ states that have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair is similar over her , but notes that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage you can put better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ cher than Blair itself , when he had opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ re@@ bel , for Blair had rejected the principle of the EU adopted by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never got it to him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me the back in Westminster a friendly l@@ apse on the back - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need time for me to waste it - seems to repeat a danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ ray Strategy of the 80 @-@ er years , an error back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly using Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position for Europe - I put it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arb@@ ons tendency and the fur@@ rows of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ alter@@ ism anyone can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; Ben@@ no , but not Ben@@ n@@ ite , &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , as the boy sc@@ outs in him did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was trying to say the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ atten@@ zion@@ ator a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father stro@@ ve for television , loyal to his Labour cabinet forces , without going to go far and to lose his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain in all circumstances - Ben@@ n@@ an expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , yet what J@@ C told his fellow @-@ strikes and representatives after all reports on their clo@@ ister on the Assembly . &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even has touched - News @-@ Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the structure of Social Media , a breeding @-@ site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum environment for granted , how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell &apos;s said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins will certainly think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns the basic ambig@@ ui@@ ties of EU membership - in accordance with their Ben@@ n@@ ite si@@ ege @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not more than a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ si@@ dents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute . &quot;
&quot; like with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to Australia - will try to find foreign diplom@@ ats quickly to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin have to cope with political capital , they also have suspic@@ ious elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British unless it can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost of rel@@ oc@@ alisation of the T@@ ory government in power where I was reminded at the launch on Monday , what is the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
expert critic@@ ising the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with ties to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; writing experts , registered at the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et join the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; primitive report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load @-@ ability of the data and transferred to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journals Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; , &quot; founded on the p@@ he his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and were asked if the statements &quot; &quot; built &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health Research at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expecting that the asser@@ tion of p@@ he , that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are roughly 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; at a detailed review of wise and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement is made from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi@@ disciplinary responses ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Coll@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ogen@@ ated products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health was , whose management was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Use ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , told her . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes maker , but not financing that he has received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the body are not provided , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes festivals , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in teaching control .
at the meeting was also the tobacco organizers of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; hing@@ es &quot; note , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for damages most of the products on most criteria &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the asser@@ tions of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far there is no evidence to serve E @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that he re@@ acted upon the asser@@ tion of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in its addiction .
&quot; all evidence will suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to them are low , but that we continue to have the long @-@ term consequences . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative danger compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people per year die of a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion Euros per year . &quot;
&quot; the clear guidelines of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up to the BBC En@@ ders , says the former chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square so@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; said that the circular fee is only to be used to make the type of programs that cannot be sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC sure that they will have been seen publicly @-@ legal programs , which will likely be seen by a smaller audience , in harsh cut@@ ted tim@@ ings against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate @-@ General , Tony Hall , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , to get in contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which also clearly revealed by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fees , what I consider the mid@@ - or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should not do his production at least for programs that others do not . &quot;
they send the Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve maximum support for their future as a whole .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s natural nonsense . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a rainy tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both peculi@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , other channels would give their right arm for this . &quot;
I am trying to see how this is to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t believe that this will decrease the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a busin@@ es@@ sper@@ son for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s blame for hunting has been &quot; due to the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of BBC enter the again , leading the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ ard lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; said that the rather public @-@ legal nom@@ ic programmes &quot; must go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can rather match the audience , but they satisfy their duties , and they can argue , if it created for their apparent missions to the justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting fees , &quot; Well , naturally , we have seen all these obsc@@ ures programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they lay them in a window @-@ window , where no one ever wanted to see it . &quot;
&quot; the circular fee said Johnson to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all of us that you get a great value here for 150 £ a year , but for people who is about 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ light and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also declared to the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC its Rei@@ th@@ ian @-@ mission to inform and entertain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be classi@@ fy as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV @-@ production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she should take an example on the public @-@ legal TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC really should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he stated that only a handful of TV will be shown and with the commercial tran@@ smit@@ ters to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Other etics &apos;s can control brain cells by b@@ illing @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment , in which they are pun@@ ish with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that are controlled by b@@ umps on sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which they relate to high frequencies to be heard to be disp@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; the stim@@ uli work by switching from mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves . &quot;
another topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said the wor@@ ms pointed out the power of a new procedure , called prob@@ abil@@ etics , where ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to enable a range of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told The Guardian , that the procedure of one day the depths of the brain can replace the electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; nu@@ di@@ ments do not usually react on ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani felt that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion batteries and found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters cells .
the b@@ umps effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled nas@@ emat@@ odes that changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of her Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons add TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ as@@ ound dedicated to the changed creatures , the b@@ umps are reinforced by the micro @-@ sound and turn into the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic engineering , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientist allows to switch to neur@@ ons of impul@@ ses with impul@@ ses . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ an@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; contrary to light , that needs to be sent from an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , auxili@@ ary kil@@ ograms can happen quickly and so can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the ange@@ ed human neur@@ ons transi@@ tional to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insul@@ in @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; they also played with the invention of a realistic and durable corporate value , but &quot; due to the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture products at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nest@@ y . &quot;
what we need now is a co @-@ operation of the British government and the guarantee that follow @-@ up devices are not being illeg@@ ally tr@@ aded before our front door .

eight golden rules for living in school lives
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I refused - and to the numerous , slower gri@@ ps more than others . &quot;
most of what I have learned may be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
&quot; the en@@ ade in school lives ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ding up to absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ wat@@ ering : people tell wh@@ ence you come , where and where you have been doing Sab@@ ih@@ ard , where you hate speech in Cor@@ by@@ n and why you can honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite , because on seriously , guys , there is just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - places your questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts and helps you to find people that you might like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your lashes were rub@@ bed in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers are . &quot;
let people get .
&quot; the rooms of people often become transformed into beverages , film @-@ night spaces and municipal meetings , but they are also places where people are tigh@@ tening and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , do not remember to start the university with a relationship &quot;
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted a crude treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many school lives form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ qu@@ artet @-@ Culture which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture would allow you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want that our friendship goes on , but you have to go away , that I can get the energy back I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a cl@@ as@@ sm@@ ite is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it a SMS instead .
apro@@ pos round : do it .
&quot; a guy in my students en@@ dow@@ ry had the idea , that a non @-@ determined door was an invitation . &quot;
he saw some things .
friendship ex@@ clude with B@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the uni at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the Klo@@ p@@ ane on the doors of people , to imagine , with a dish full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have to give you something out . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty dis@@ car@@ ies is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to entertain yourself and will end the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; mis@@ mixed cargo from fl@@ our , sugar and fat guide to it that people sleep to sleep , if you click . &quot;
food to ste@@ al is a common crime among students .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the Take a drop of milk for your tea as well ? &quot;
check this with the milk @-@ owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they should say , even if they bo@@ il in the inner . &quot;
&quot; when someone was bother@@ ed your things , the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to handle them if my ro@@ ommate share a dishwasher , which she added to her milk , to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the liter@@ al sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who are sitting in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbours , whether they do something , drum &amp; bass doing anything , for it was 3 am in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
you re@@ acted with even more older music .
&quot; as they finally stopped at 5 pm , they were allowed to sleep their neighbors even two hours before she lock her own music , shut down her door and came to her three @-@ hour review . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would occur acci@@ dentally in the same student residence ?
&quot; the other way round , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ ably embarrass@@ ed when you keep a ro@@ ommate for your future married couple , get off at her and then experience it every day and perhaps experience how they all share your common friends ? &quot;
&quot; naturally , the heart goes his own paths - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future married couple , try at least to talk a little reason at least . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone have their keys in its not sw@@ allowed room , the limit between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer , when it appears . &quot;
&quot; a good argument is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by actu@@ ators a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but negl@@ ect to one &apos;s room using to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ amp@@ oo .
&quot; close their door , and place their keys in a glass of water that you then put it in the freezer - but stap@@ ling their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , all@@ one @-@ ear@@ ing , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ tices &quot;
&quot; the real estate manager Markus G@@ ild@@ a built up in the Fran@@ con@@ ian @-@ style town@@ houses for people , who have not much money . &quot;
&quot; for instance , for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need accomodation , but also the same mother and a man @-@ servant . &quot;
&quot; I show you can still be cheap and well done today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the living market .
the entre@@ pren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly a living space can be created : it builds in a project ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. G@@ ild@@ a , and many refugees will drive on the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ ac@@ eful accommodation in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
&quot; given the refugee stream , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ a : a ter@@ rac@@ ed house needs the least square .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different when the people were sl@@ ing to housing .
&quot; each of the six houses built just in the pilot project , consists of three units of living for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ a : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amoun@@ ted to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the building took place .
this is reasonable .
have the rules lo@@ gs their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have really drawn my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ ware @-@ value and the actu@@ ator order .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three places . &quot;
only in the cities is missing for this place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ rac@@ ed house ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ a : there were , which have thrown to me for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not wrong .
but shar@@ ks not the competi@@ tor for affordable housing ?
&quot; true : it is true that in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but newly built luxury apartments , which hardly can afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the normal men need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the same mother or righteous . &quot;
I am showing how to make today more convenient and well @-@ priced .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how you will receive the new iPhone OS when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , select &quot; &quot; posted &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the telephone gives you the option to download and then install the install . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed after the installation to problems , as they obtain an error message , the exec@@ utions using the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the issue , users is recommended to either wait until the rush is reset or to try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will take you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the delet@@ ing of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the dis@@ closing of the updates un@@ prob@@ able . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you use a specific tool to delete apps , and then re @-@ install it once the process has completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a char@@ ger , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not admit that the update will be continued as the telephone could possibly switched off road paths and lead to a da@@ wning of the update . &quot;

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ dorf Anton@@ isti@@ ft opened up under the Mant@@ ell of the Social Cultural Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg .
&quot; besides deliber@@ ations , one can take part in the courses there . &quot;
the Family Foundation would pull it down from the mountain to the inner city .
more specifically said to the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Square .
there was recently a new district office opened .
&quot; here , right beside the market , you receive seniors and advice information on questions like responsible for the nursing , or the services of the nursing and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care system , that often nursing homes are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not too often many achievements of the kits are not used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances are hardly understood , &quot; said the new households in Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ell@@ et and the Ombud@@ sman as well as for the out@@ patient services &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to advisory services , the new district office offers also prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
there was taken in the boat of Sal@@ u@@ dis by boat .
&quot; thus , you can use additional offers such as rot@@ ational prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the seniors and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and re@@ hab . &quot;

&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was located at the height of the B@@ FT gas station .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ lows and pour EUR 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ir@@ ausen .
you are also pleased with the host @-@ debate Bernd Bor@@ mann , business @-@ con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice again Dr. Frank Müller on October 1st . &quot;
&quot; when Ur@@ sel Fel@@ klin@@ gh@@ ausen , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is willing to give his successor to his successor over the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase Müller opened the practice on 12th October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when those who met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently met her professional body education in the former hospital and wants to enter into practice as well . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the g@@ arbage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ watch@@ berg and laugh@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called it . &quot;
couple Müller went up the idea of running their own practice in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he can also be his own boss . &quot;
and this way you agreed that the g@@ arbage I bought the house with practice .
living in a period they are still staying in a fraction of Vil@@ sen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ time fam@@ il@@ lover of Frank Müller also grown , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ â@@ tel . &quot;
&quot; currently he worked as a super@@ visor in Sul@@ ingen , in addition he was appointed to the leading emergency in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved hon@@ orary capacity in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness resistance in Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting on 19 September , the practice for the new boss is being prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Field die as a household , his gat@@ se Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) has specialized in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the g@@ arbage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle for as home@@ work . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ modeling the rooms will be more modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and loads of loads and need an intercom more .
furthermore the ED@@ V is completely renewed .

&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; emphasized Sam@@ t@@ fel@@ ine Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients , according to the Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , each quarter will come into practice at the practice of Fel@@ ir@@ ausen , in the North German A@@ verage practice , about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf you can find another home office .
a positive out@@ effect of the practice @-@ effect of Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ au@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it would have gone .
who refuse an hour &apos;s talk is to be found mostly in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ watch@@ ings .
&quot; with their part@@ ing , ending in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , the medicine still practiced a total of 30 years . &quot;

&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ moor and many patients will certainly see another , &quot; says the boarding . &quot;
&quot; your husband will be compl@@ em@@ enting : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed me against hor@@ tic@@ e@@ work , now it could be different . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; now the border controls will be highly ranked in our southern border , &quot; said Mr. Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the border controls to the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this .
&quot; just as before that everyone , one wants to make a asylum application , this can also &quot; &quot; do &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are at the forefront .
&quot; but clearly , it is also that it seems clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept bound@@ less migration flows , also not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia itself
&quot; the Croatian Government had previously announced , also Slovenia wants to continue for the refugees in Austria and Germany to develop cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in this way , this Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather to intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the limit - primarily to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
on the other hand the border with Croatia is already strong controlled .
&quot; as the minister stressed , Slovenia wants to Sloven@@ es its limits for refugees but not abri@@ a . &quot;
&quot; every EU member has to fill up its commitments , otherwise the system may not work , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian Government , the first refugees had already tried to go on Tuesday in the night @-@ night hours , in Eastern Croatian border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to escape the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could access them in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , meanwhile , meanwhile , meet the police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also life services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days the country will be calculated with some 4,000 refugees , &quot; said Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; also buses from Pres@@ evo , on the Maced@@ onian border that had brought far migrants to the Hungarian border , on Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade ranks , however , that it is to strike the people wise , certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor want to do this , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the media , in the morning a first bus had around 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers had been the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border in Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police declared to us to go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually indeed appear to the shifting shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat higher @-@ located route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a strong refuge of refugees to the corresponding plans for possible explo@@ it@@ ating situations . &quot;
&quot; he did not called he , but he pointed out that Croatia became a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , which since 2007 , has under@@ gone a good witness to the country &apos;s standard border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , behind the Hungarian border train , some 300 refugees continue to live . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reporting , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who leads after R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two mar@@ g@@ inal operations of the H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees needed to go to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to re@@ assure her early Wednesday at H@@ org@@ os : he stop the debates on altern@@ ate route of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
this would not be very hard to pay the time of the refugees .
&quot; you can &apos;t tell if they would continue their trip on Hungary , Croatia and another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian cou@@ p@@ ists have already begun to distribute to the refugees trying to capit@@ alize on which alternative routes by Croatia are shown . &quot;
&quot; however , the Border Cros@@ sing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croati@@ a- still not cleared away . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ern was sent in the border region .

&quot; while some Pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously arose spont@@ aneously to the Cre@@ de and disc@@ usses the proposition of &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long &quot; , &quot; they remain near@@ ing , please read propositions just as far I am not yet and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge of minor discussions about the action itself , about life , the handling of dying . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just on site .

&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets , but be understandable , finally , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death was still per@@ ished with tab@@ oos , so that the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer did so much that the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have much contributed to making people open . &quot;

&quot; at that point in the past year , Fed@@ Ex on that the company wanted to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market @-@ trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a win between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the 2010 financial year , which ended in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts . &quot;
an@@ al@@ ysts were expected to have a survey of fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lowest prospect come in spite of the price increase , which is an average of 4,@@ 9 percent and in spite of higher conditions for soil transpor@@ ting of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is nonetheless observ@@ atory that the result compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trade will increase . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is &quot; &quot; solid yiel@@ ds &quot; &quot; if we take the weaker than expected economic conditions , primarily in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
&quot; plans for holidays dis@@ employment have been announced one day later than those of the ri@@ vals stage , which is planning , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter finished on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at AC $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve von Z@@ acks Investment Research ex@@ quired an@@ al@@ ysts pre@@ predic@@ tions . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six of Z@@ acks were asked for 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has brought a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ ent shipping , which brought the sales in its unity with express delivery . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was mainly flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unity compar@@ ably higher income due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market @-@ trade , about one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex Shar@@ es at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 percent , on 15@@ 0.15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , she ended with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spend two days per week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot of Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ in . &quot;
&quot; dor@@ man@@ t on them at an end of the generated , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting room , is a wall @-@ image of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles , and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things . &quot;
the central bank has a two @-@ times contract for the congress : maxim@@ ize the US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a failed third mandate - financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ di@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday , if the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make certain pre @-@ cau@@ tious pre @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives , these vol@@ ati@@ lity , by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important what they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ ay &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market enough justi@@ fication will continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what the financial market is uns@@ ure .
&quot; about half the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloomberg , have predicted that week in Zin@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets are looking forward to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the stra@@ ining the blow to mi@@ tig@@ ate by pl@@ edges that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value at 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.7 % to 16@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the promotion has been triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy continued the sentence this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist said by Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does so , &quot; she would have to move very far to calm the financial markets , so that they do not panic into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a zinc mining would re@@ assure the financial markets , because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways , the set to increase four@@ teen percent@@ ages in this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the spher@@ ical conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer that , in this year , despite the complaints of Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement was solid on the labour market this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank from 5.5 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the levels that sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
pay@@ roll have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; even though it was constantly reported among the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets throughout the world were transported to the end of last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage declined in May by more than 16 % among its top quality , as investors feared that a dec@@ eler@@ ation of Chinese economies would increase global growth . &quot;
&quot; during this month , the market has recovered several recovered , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the pole . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when you should raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not appeared during the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former employee of the US Not@@ en@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; now he says that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what implications will be on the US economy and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main priorities of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; however , in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been huge in recent years .
&quot; the mere reference of the head of then Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed their mon@@ e@@ arian expansion &quot; can drop , b@@ able confusion around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emerging , from the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in other places but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ech@@ ell Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which are linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , a head@@ lamp member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocates in favour of a Zin@@ tion @-@ cave , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia entru@@ sted the F@@ ed to its Lei@@ tz@@ ins to &quot; &quot; 19 percentage points in three sessions &quot; , &quot; following limited recognition of growth in the US &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives had revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should set out aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the market &apos;s re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly did not get into the situation where they fear an interest rate because the markets could rise , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act continues to have double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not believe it should be hur@@ ry ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; we welcome you to your warm welcome , does not work without the engagement of a volunteer couns@@ el . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who can support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with heart and soul a teacher .
&quot; also with her 74 L@@ ear , she is still being taught . &quot;
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seeker as the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ distan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of the other classes are in the right school . &quot;
Brazilian Society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian Organisation SP@@ RS tries to educate women on sho@@ cking way women , how important good nutrition throughout the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies which are su@@ cking to Brü@@ sten , which are common with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies to all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get into effect , their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ä@@ te@@ tical adaptation that should make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating , pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new race of the Spor@@ hall
the municipal am@@ ber Bern@@ expected approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros in the sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat@@ ter for solar panels .
the plans for the long @-@ deser@@ ti@@ th@@ eses at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ forum come step by step forward : in the recent council meeting the extended building application was dro@@ wned without big discussions .
previously the Panel had decided to present a request for a given legal &quot; Ex@@ trac@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; from a valid development plan .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; , &quot; we were permission for a special form of construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this document , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof has a &quot; &quot; first and roof @-@ class &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the prescribed use of the roof @-@ surface for solar installations , &quot; &quot; we get a wonderful big southern spot , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the roof mounting , that is made from energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan , under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan has no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; regarding the construction sides - with the am@@ ural crest in the general rule in the resolution is more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; this was however not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; such as St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ around at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ expected .
at the expense of approximately € 2.@@ 3@@ million euros will be calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports .
the progress of the procedure for the 18 x 36 meters high hall is now presented to the country and were submitted to the review .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed before and planned - namely 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will also become the Hospital director of the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au at the same time .
the station and the majority of employees run from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg and went to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seeing the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land @-@ circle , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this subject is the Supervisory Board , and the conven@@ es on the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans have been put into practice , all of them would continue to move under 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority of fishermen are moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s existing drive towards Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who cannot be moved with to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff is informed of the plans .
&quot; fired the change in the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only worked as a director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to start the succession , came according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game that is ready to take control and move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is considered in any case a &quot; &quot; sc@@ oring &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the section &quot; &quot; Intern@@ al medicine &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is specialised in heart @-@ made and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner center on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; even for the next two years Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board manages to agree on both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ endi@@ ces , which has still been closed over 35 beds , which has finally been closed for almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the country has planned this for 2018 , if the current re@@ pris@@ ings at the Man@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ ch@@ ner Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , regul@@ ating rum@@ ours that the house which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , in future for asylum seek@@ ers shall be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I close it . as it continues with the property , Jo@@ ch@@ ner could not say , there are several refl@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ time beam of the Car@@ itas and a daily psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ ates accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; what we could not happen , such an occasion does not come again , &quot; &quot; so Fischer over the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ve to the Le@@ ch who has been &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fisher@@ man has worked as a chief specialist for over 30 years , did not give it . &quot;
he was asked for his ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the post of the physician .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was regularly threatened by closure , departments are closed , for instance surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ ball of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 30h ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of Viol@@ ations
a Tat@@ ab@@ domin@@ ate has led the police to the bre@@ aches of people working since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ de the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds ran to the young people and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is falling into a victim of violence .
&quot; the ark of the young woman was found at the Saturday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too com@@ it@@ ant one also holds a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was in fact st@@ ating the statement by reason and the investig@@ ators to find the place of suffering . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday mor@@ nings after they had not come home after a visit of autumn Festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen and was agreed .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators look first to personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the friends of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the los@@ est , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the mut@@ ant offen@@ ders led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot;
&quot; the strongh@@ olds were killed by the authorities in the police , which 16 @-@ year @-@ old are killed and who have placed the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns before over@@ pressures
the situation on the German market @-@ market is tense .
even more refugees need to be looking for a pay@@ able lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German living @-@ market have long gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and work seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot;
they compete with income from weak citizens around the last pay@@ able flats .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , this must be built to 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this outcome comes a study on behalf of the association agreement &quot; &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison , the total of 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , there are no 8@@ 0,000 flats . &quot;
&quot; refugees were no longer oblig@@ ated after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial reserve . &quot;
many come across the living @-@ market as well as in the long sn@@ akes of flat rentals .
&quot; however , according to Statisti@@ cal Office all last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers had to rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing is not only in the increasing traffic of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing construction of the last years .
&quot; Germany over@@ turn a higher deficit stood before , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently in the metropol@@ itan areas , there were already some 77@@ 0,000 units : lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals have therefore seen not@@ ated in big cities in the W@@ G @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed because of the dol@@ drums on the living @-@ market un@@ wit@@ ched longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in large cities , the number of square meter per cap@@ ita in the past years has fallen back into the past few years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the coalition of &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; suggests a new start . &quot;
thereby new incentives should boost the social housing construction again .
&quot; thus , it could be disp@@ ens@@ ed to the underlying order tax and the property tax for promoted apartments are limited . &quot;
furthermore it is necessary as an alternative @-@ tax de@@ preci@@ ation options .
the subsidies for the refugee area of the Staats@@ bank K@@ f@@ W comes close to cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start was ended on Monday night with 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be extended even .
refugees have a free validity : Croatia and Slovenia to cor@@ ridor .
&quot; there is practically no cross to Hungary since more , and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to give the passage across Slovenia to North without hur@@ dles .
dangerous is the route yet .
Croatia wants to face Slovenia through the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Minister , and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria , and is already a Schengen area . &quot;
EU @-@ country Croatia is still not a Schengen area .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik reports of the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sail@@ ed its border for refugees on the eve of the refugees .
new laws passed on the same day into effect and super@@ flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary almost super@@ flu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; the Croatian Court of Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who were not wanted to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police took the first refugees crossing the border to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
&quot; mostly people were reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after her arrival , she would have tried to walk on the green border to Croatia . &quot;
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border did not reach the border of borders on the Croatian border .
&quot; therefore , the border stri@@ pe between other dangers are there , there are scar@@ fs Min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ v War of civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ dre@@ er is now to quickly create a safe passage .
Hungary will hardly come to Hungary following the closing of the limit .
on Tuesday had the police of 36@@ 6 infl@@ ated people .
shortly before the end of the Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws passed the overcoming and damage of the border za@@ us as a crime .
&quot; in the south @-@ Hungarian border area Sz@@ eged , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
the im@@ print shar@@ pen@@ ed for up to five years and a deportation from the country .
&quot; on Tuesday , according to the registration office &quot; &quot; Tran@@ l@@ ations &quot; , &quot; held on Tuesday in the new border on the border with a total of 94 asylum applications , almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people are available . &quot;
on Wednesday morning we expected to have more than 40 refugees .
&quot; practically , no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary asylum . &quot;
in an un@@ stable view Serbia is a &quot; safe @-@ third country . &quot;
the ex@@ ited asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported to this .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ ing zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to deal with it .
they gathered the g@@ arbage to leave the T@@ tens of thousands in the past weeks on the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood bar@@ gain have been eliminated and one of the entrance facility in the bor@@ derland was rebuilt .
&quot; in order to achieve this circum@@ vent , no one wanted to express itself . &quot;
Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees arrive .
the country also has its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still held in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for Germany to continue . &quot;
the draw from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the statement of German authorities .
&quot; in Fran@@ l@@ ass@@ ing , there are regularly smaller groups of refugees to walk . &quot;
Mayor of the &quot; Ges@@ tr@@ and@@ ete &quot; on the border
&quot; we were on the bridge @-@ feast on Sunday with the austerity area , when suddenly ten people were standing on the entrance of the tent at the entrance of the tent , &quot; such Wer@@ n@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Mo@@ ers . &quot;
tourists who wanted to get to Pass@@ au by train .
&quot; because Germany was surprisingly on Sunday because of the refugee stream of railway traffic with Austria was surprisingly , the city council where immediately his help was offered and the singing along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Nahe river Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; previously , we did not even shor@@ ten the un@@ expected guests , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
we immediately said that we &apos;ll bring it to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; &quot; the patron of the O@@ Ö@@ N &quot; conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take out to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this was very happy , &quot; &quot; City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the charges were killed at the Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , in order to continue after the short notice , that the railway traffic is stopped after Germany , but still trying to try the limit . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed before the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
in Wer@@ n@@ stein the cross @-@ border generally is high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ fest @-@ association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday li@@ ven - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; now , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án are now sending further Z@@ ig@@ nia to us , is a logical result of a apparent political policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping to help the construction of structures that ensure human@@ eness , our Chancellor continued to be highly publi@@ ci@@ zed and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dark @-@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
ly@@ au@@ ction of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who now confront in the bor@@ derland with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the whis@@ per@@ ed must find that the &apos; praised land &quot; , &quot; that they invited and welcomed there , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , in the face of the persistent refugee flow and the ending winter , to establish decent situations for search@@ engine . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5.000 winter solid quar@@ ks
&quot; finally , Konrad has dealing with the control of all hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad it acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to his word weight .
the government has used the formerly powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker in order to raise the lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousand refugees .
the chaos in the Initi@@ al Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got a grip on .
&quot; we do not have homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; lodging of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived on Monday to Austria had no great tur@@ mo@@ il , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; champi@@ onships . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Interior spoke about a &quot; bank@@ rupt situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad , with one demand of 8@@ 5,000 tiles in the past year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number required , over the next few weeks , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found - 20.000 new federal government shall provide more than € 15,000 . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already brought talks with the local merchants .
&quot; they would have secured him , even for the coming refugees quot@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born , yet it is expected to explain how the church will help . &quot;
&quot; high expectations , the asylum coordin@@ ator will also place in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals are not available to provide accommodation .
&quot; additionally , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot;
&quot; finally , Konrad and Ma@@ ier stipul@@ ates the standards of accommodation as &apos; very high . &quot;
&quot; in emergency times , it can be no longer that mer@@ g@@ ist will have to keep a certain height of the hand @-@ to@@ wel or the size of the upper arms . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; need@@ ing &quot; &quot; to be valid . &quot;
&quot; that he was successful in opposition to the Interior when creating more successful , according to Konrad , with his experience . &quot;
I am a older gentl@@ eman who does not say without any further into the face of the truth .
belief is his most important weapon .
&quot; finally , Konrad and Ma@@ ier the Republic do not cause any costs as they said themselves . &quot;
the number of employees want to raise them on three to four .
the own lod@@ g@@ ings have not been successful until now .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the square Steph@@ an@@ splatz at the office .
but there is apparently problem with the approval .
Linz challenges a better break@@ down
&quot; first , no opening of city halls and other buildings such as tips arena and design centers for keeping refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; currently , this is not necessary since the person can currently do without those measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
but there are more sites to be tested for the emergency .
criticism of the chief manager in the division of refugees within the state of the country .
other areas need to contribute to their input .
&quot; Water@@ seals , &quot; &quot; Bor@@ ders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst K@@ ag@@ itation ( CS@@ U ) has state @-@ owned company Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday to further action in the refugees .
&quot; now , the sea @-@ o@@ fer has assured that the German borders will not be sealed off . &quot;
departure of refugees in the Federal Republic shall continue to be possible .
however there is now the corresponding border controls .
on the contrary with refugees in Germany there will be no longer any left .
but the aspir@@ ation would also be brought to Germany with regular moves .
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ s called for greater solidarity in the refugees . &quot;
&quot; that now also Austria is introduced to its borders , Austria is a logical consequence of &quot; ag@@ it@@ ating &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a matter of time
&quot; the general contractor of the &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; at the Lin@@ zer industry is officially finished . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T is being used , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is designed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the fields of technology . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads of our resource - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start @-@ up firms of the New ship@@ yard and later on which they are negotiating .
&quot; already from the start , S &amp; T wants to collaborate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promised several things : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million Euro were invested by S &amp; T into the site , 3.3 million euros by the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria District and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is designed from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ centre .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter area in the building are rented out , for another 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
lia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ an opened a second store in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
actually Jut@@ ta wanted to present a dog with them .
this project had to push the 49 year @-@ year @-@ old associates of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pi@@ geon market . finally she now got access to the shape of another business location .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop against the company , in which they sold under other bags , suitcases , shoes and gar@@ ds of different manufacturers , all of them are about dam p@@ urses in the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ wall@@ ets to be from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and acces@@ soires of up to 500 Euro .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop has been in operation . &quot;
this has been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; but I have a long time about whether I am supposed to open a store , &quot; says broadly . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the cruci@@ fy in the Grand room Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has been broad from her mother to the cradle .
I &apos;m afraid of the most when something developed and I can show new trends at high quality prices .
why some woman in sight of a nice hand@@ bag in tin containers can also answer the professional woman with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a location , whose inhabitants called it . &quot;
&quot; this property also links some of the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for Ex@@ am .
whether he is raised to a hos@@ tile of journalists , journalists , or researchers in the international crisis policy - the applicant &apos;s office remains strong for the election campaigns . &quot;
and cuts well together .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt where the grandparents were descen@@ ded from the real estate milli@@ ard .
the New Yorker with the com@@ promis@@ ist is a term in the wine @-@ building on the wine @-@ road .
&quot; man@@ made in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is related to it via -@@ zig , with it . &quot;
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the electoral mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about their aim of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but in its K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , it is not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the birth@@ place K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot a am@@ using documentary movie about the place and its famous spra@@ wling , to which beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; dump , known not for mod@@ est@@ y , comes in &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too word - so with the statement that it would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the hearts , he has not sent it there . &quot;
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ant the opinion that tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; necessarily l@@ acked the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - to high @-@ German , the supply , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is thus coming from the village of the Offer .
&quot; the dump track record started , 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the US a restaurant for the min@@ er opened . &quot;
the foundation of the real estate company were the first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy : your desire to return to return to the home , resign@@ ed by the Bav@@ arian state , which the Palat@@ inate stood at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once written without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches History and Folklore , Roland Paul , hosted the film start . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that stands in contrast to the included statements of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called the building of a border per@@ im@@ eter to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ arity , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote family character ( &quot; The O@@ ma was one @-@ born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; he is always so ascen@@ ding . &quot;
believes that Tr@@ ump mal goes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never has taken care of any city . &quot;
&quot; the pension sp@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm , like some , some , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended up something for the church organ , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine the Donald &apos;s boy , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they are better if he does not win the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had already had the say at the time of his grandfather in the United States , they would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cks Sarah Solo@@ ists . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not yes , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are even ri@@ pe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; get movie , viewed for the Tr@@ ump long interview , 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ gers , also in the USA awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take the loss of leadership at the Today show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son drove to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but it did not provide great shifts in the review for today . &quot;

&quot; this disadvantage of the ab@@ out@@ stands seemed to play no role for the Australian TV audience , as Sun@@ rise has scored an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spect@@ ators in the five main towns , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months today the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed .
&quot; in August today , on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 , compared to the 3@@ 30.000 by Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting what happens every morning .
the winds of change affect the mor@@ nings more than the Parliament !

&quot; the last three of us agree with : Bachelor &apos;s wood is the perfect man , but whom will he choose ? &quot;
secret to be revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly , who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood is in the Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped in the chief tru@@ de . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we come with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three , checked , you possibly did not acci@@ dentally give an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues its lips until the final on Thursday sealed
&quot; all three women have been studied in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed , &quot; If not thou , who was to get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; could her answers to the player , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and ch@@ os@@ ki called both fast , except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with one another from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies re@@ marked , there I noticed that she was fairly compatible and I thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her together &quot; , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood as a couple would be well suited .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week you made sure that Wood &quot; The One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this obviously not just a game - I am now de@@ duc@@ tive on him &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked what wood choose to choose if not she , there was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl alike - it &apos;s a draw between s@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is released on Wednesday , 19 : 30h , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams working after his stunning training day late last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some coaches would have run Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a ram@@ ble to how it won the Aussie Ru@@ g@@ by league con@@ co@@ sting at his first p@@ unt line on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula rested his man and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to a unt @-@ Return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to prove his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team bra@@ g by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne expressed public in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams @-@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to forget his po@@ w@@ te@@ es f@@ ang and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t restored in a P@@ unt , who was restored in the first play @-@ quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive broad@@ cast@@ ers had hop@@ ed for his N@@ FL . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left on the fi@@ d@@ ble cur@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ plus 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , it just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne ver@@ ted the car@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y field for Queensland .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen are shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year child , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police were caught by rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke on Tuesday evening in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;

&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were in@@ ju@@ red , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber compounds which is known to kill , but that they are traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternative , apparently with so high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in the middle of the southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi describe the new provinces to reduce their political influence within the framework of the proposed new constitution . &quot;

reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; Processing by Christian Pl@@ umb
for easily overweight di@@ ab@@ etics can be useful to weight surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still early to say whether easily persu@@ aded obes@@ e people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial switch to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot;
wei@@ ghting loss surger@@ ies or obesity use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b nutrients .
&quot; over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ as has proven childhood operations to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes but most studies were carried out in people , the disease is obes@@ e with an body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) from 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain level of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people who have a BMI over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare with two types of obesity and magn@@ en@@ b@@ yp@@ ass and medical treatments for type @-@ 2 @-@ Diabetes with people who were easily overweight .
&quot; the average BMI among those who under@@ went this operation , dropped from 31 to 24,@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the BMI with people who did not receive @-@ surgical diabetes treatments , approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , there are 36 % of the diabetes disorder completely and in 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , only approximately two percent compared to the diabetes were eliminated , and in some cases , only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were carried out in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group &quot; &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also follow the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best under 7 per cent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c sank from approximately 9 percent to approximately 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not dimin@@ ished the mortality in five years , such as the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also negoti@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger res@@ ili@@ ence in BMI ( 7.6 % vs. 2.7 % ) and then reported a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study which leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people , subjected to a obesity surgery almost 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that has conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not have an advantage for the survival of the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said , it is so@@ othing for persons who are interested in a BMI between 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , without raised risk of death or kidney disease , &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone notes that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is in his BMI between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once you accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that increased currently in fiction : a young woman , school seasons , and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meet after years the flock of her youth again , and this she &apos;s love in her . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the recently created novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not that &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the love story is likely that the novel might be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück readers , for it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put in her hom@@ etown a liter@@ ary monument .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take in all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East fell . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders called for an end to stop violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of permanent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visits in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford related to ethics studies .
&quot; it demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity must be placed prior to the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
he emphas@@ ised that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was much admired , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis praised , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to worry about several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a genuine peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries can be made . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised to the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent response from the US turned out a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my appl@@ ause in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to resolve this issue lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold rise of in@@ ges@@ inf@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; popular control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percentage increase in the number of children under 12 years that sw@@ allow strongly alcoholic inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of palm infectious agents in children under 12 years , the po@@ int@@ ental control centers report , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in need , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children are inf@@ ect@@ ant to drink , while some do it to impress their friends , or for a mut@@ ation with the social media . &quot;
YouTube to show how young inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
people have said dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ based mouth @-@ water mixed to obtain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be instruc@@ ted by attractive no@@ zzles for dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ umes .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange candles , which are very pleas@@ ing for children . &quot;
slopes san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially for to@@ dd@@ lers there can be a few sy@@ ringe to alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly focused alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison Hospital in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transm@@ itter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not leave mu@@ ck whis@@ ky in hand , but people leave these hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come about it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ year girl , recently taken four sp@@ lash of after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant drugs in school has been taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; their blood sugar was 179 . twice higher than the threshold , which , in an adult , lawful than drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ched doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah slept their words and was unable to walk as they arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors drove them over night in a separate children hospital at signs of mill@@ et trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and cast her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to super@@ vise alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing out there were several dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario , after the t@@ wit@@ ch@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contains a toxic , non @-@ ground@@ ed ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suggest that the product meth@@ anol has contained , a deadly fix , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which was noted as substance . &quot;
&quot; in January three students from the fourth grade in the State New York appointed to det@@ ox@@ i@@ fy their &quot; teacher &quot; fighting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so sign a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hill@@ top inf@@ ect@@ ant and ex@@ iles them out of their space .

the lack of title competition in the Scottish football du@@ ll - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people are not just talking about the return of the angers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will be getting around things s@@ é@@ ed Dei@@ la .
&quot; Ronn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic needs to fight , but the Norwegian Chef in@@ or to turn things into turn . &quot;

&quot; then , Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had made bad times before and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad over what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly as we have to go .
we really need to get the support from Celtic because that makes the player better .
now naturally is so important .

he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation was performed for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day was closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists have allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since often more applicants are available to be available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be chosen is it emoti@@ onally observe .
I cannot do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , my friend sit , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two @-@ hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison government say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and take a pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the history of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive access . &quot;
I complain with her .
&quot; she dre@@ amed that she &quot; &quot; could have been better artic@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ lei@@ surely had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; however , he wants an international re@@ por@@ ter to write there . &quot;
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will aid the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ viewer of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to me sitting . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the Pod@@ casts &apos; series that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go here again to all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ es would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of action .
&quot; but I believe that a strong probability exists , that he is not guilty of the mur@@ derer . &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be genuinely objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters to which you can turn for it .
&quot; what you will receive from me , is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death . &quot;
man to mo@@ ist police @-@ o@@ e@@ hunt @-@ talks to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police has been dry when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th , the police hang out was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officers , the tried to over@@ talk him to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was announced on Tuesday to a house peace breaking in Bec@@ ken@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape it in the direction C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he was not too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , Come and grow me , &quot; said senior S@@ hand@@ ell , S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ ish Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic to make its uni@@ forms wet , so he turned out a reliable tactics - &quot; A good polic@@ eman &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Sergei Cast@@ l@@ ed@@ ine . &quot;
master @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , cous@@ ins , his car went in the dit@@ ch to go to an alcohol control and tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired and inspired to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben cous@@ ins @-@ bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moody claims that Ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him and threat@@ ens the racing sport .
&quot; said Peter Moody , that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables next year and thre@@ aten to finish the race immediately . &quot;
he quoted on the ste@@ wards and the integration department at Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment with the last stra@@ w on Wednesday .
&quot; Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for the racing sport and he himself had found himself under difficult conditions than a positive cob@@ alt lo@@ z@@ on test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had res@@ sed for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age sl@@ ate and did not want it to see it like too high @-@ sided grapes .
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long been eating , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything happens at once . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk up@@ front , and I want my owners think that I try my best to her . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do this , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I must then think of what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody the Bom@@ b had to make sophisticated the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had tried to sp@@ y his stable sp@@ y . &quot;
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables for providing information about what I do inside my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moody &apos;s rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe that I am a fraud .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly hold onto their n@@ oses , because it is trying to put me in touch . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RU@@ L , David Moo@@ y , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of RU@@ L , were aware of that and are still alive today . &quot;
should I believe me that it is personal ?
&quot; follow the RV@@ L , and perhaps , people are responsible outside of trainers who are responsible for what is happening in the branch ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
&quot; maybe people think out there , that I am . &quot;
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and b@@ yp@@ ass me , and I have no doubt that what I say to them now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now at the point where I go no matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I shall put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the gro@@ wers of the trainer have emerged with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he would throw him his license on the table .
&quot; Moody &apos;s best known for his preparation of the un@@ finished master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , indicated the &quot; &quot; hot @-@ treatment rule &quot; , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse , which came against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has w@@ aged ear@@ then mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been like the whole day , which was that way . &quot;
it was also such a race on the race .
Moody could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who impose these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you have too far gone , &quot; &quot; said Moody &apos;s . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y suggests against ri@@ vals for statements on ring battle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has given criticism of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League Play@@ ers of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires won the Storm players &quot; Grand Battle &quot; with his team during the high CM @-@ winning in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos coach Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett turned out an almost disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team . he called the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on the Satur@@ day@@ evening . he called the game a &quot; sample game &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland don &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew , and said that they were concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team agree with him , as it claims that they are worried about the CM @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; that appears over and over again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson about ring struggles , when she struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our defensive system or techniques in the whole year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es , a real emphasis and this has achieved for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . it is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
&quot; it is strange , as this time and again appears at this time of year . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked the &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; and reminds of his ment@@ or that ben@@ net@@ ts St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragons the Premier League in 2010 won with &quot; bor@@ ed &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he was compared his play on Saturday night with our evening Friday night and as ex@@ iting their game , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and play as a thrilling happening , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you want to play if you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his style of football - not each team has played two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play as these . &quot;
&quot; I raise trust in because they are saying these things , because they are a bit worried against us to play . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when the Big Games went .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs. Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of bronze was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are Pau@@ w we do and not any points for a cl@@ ing ?
for me it is the schedu@@ les .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet at one stage yet . &quot;
the CM @-@ Team has released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on next Saturday night at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin from next year morning .
&quot; biking with 200,000 $ deposit to drug &quot; &quot; drug &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly thre@@ aten a life long sentence due to his lead , into the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms Kok@@ ain , which were gr@@ aded after Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the federal states was placed 100 kg of Dro@@ ge on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America through V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ lic@@ on was observed how he met his co @-@ mate at the marina and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse , where the police were 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly long life penalty for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the couns@@ el of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that it might have been in the café from a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the flood of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; stated to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he bent the police on his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars for security combined to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ oc@@ ated explanations of the two persons it is clear that the edition of a 200,000 dollar will be a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Mr Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from de@@ duc@@ ted , he burned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , un@@ occupied by the police and sat at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

the mass turns it : every two years the high@@ ways of the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; 2015 , particular movement is found in the comp@@ ass days , which are currently especially well sold . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations assessed by the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) just in August on this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( roadmap from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept @-@ vehicles and new senior managers and luxury cars this year , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest vehicles for the German auto industry is the Opel Astr@@ a , which is standing by the dealers in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astr@@ a is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neum@@ ann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the very core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume of the volume , the new Astr@@ a is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is just below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current Astr@@ a costs from 16 990 euros .
the Astr@@ a is available with a new 1,@@ 4 l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ esse offers more diesel engines and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 HP , which for the first time also includes three @-@ cylin@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astr@@ a is first just as fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second version will follow in the spring of the Committee , which is already visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what is driving up next to the Astr@@ a on the I@@ AA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault are sending the fourth generation of his Astr@@ a competi@@ tively Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
on the show the Mé@@ gan@@ e focuses only as fi@@ ves in a conventional and an emphasises sport GT @-@ Version .
&quot; in the trade coming next year , he will come as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ Reg@@ er wants to find his position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; thereby , the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but it is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno who celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,0 @-@ Liter @-@ Tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is by manufacturer &apos;s liability at 170 New@@ t@@ meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
&quot; 4 : not completely new , but completely replaced is the compact out@@ panel DS 4 , which is shown on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside laid the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Abl@@ eg@@ ers , especially hand at the front parti@@ te : here the cooler clim@@ ates newly drawn and the changed spot@@ lights with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reduces the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and reduces the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; on the I@@ AA show in the compact class a number of overclo@@ ckers and new varieties , like the raised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square metres cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court made a ex @-@ prisoners of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary right to be accommod@@ ated in a small cell .
&quot; due to the infringement of their lives , the prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this had decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution on Wednesday .
the people affected can even grow to money if only a few days were im@@ pris@@ oned in the narro@@ wly rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his Constitutional Court will be successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in an Berlin @-@ pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Berlin @-@ T@@ egel between June and November 2009 , divided into a single cell of around five square metres of land ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who has arrived at the free time after some of his lawyer , moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his ministers responsible for the ou@@ trag@@ eous state @-@ conditions against the Land of Berlin were un@@ true .
&quot; however , the rec@@ ti@@ fier suspen@@ ds the judgment of the Kam@@ mer@@ Court of Berlin and transferred the case to the restart there . &quot;
you see the human dignity of the man in@@ ju@@ red .
Kam@@ mer@@ Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons may be largely made of the fragile period only a few days to the compensation for compensation , it was supposed to be an equ@@ als . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; cont@@ end of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kam@@ mer@@ Court must now clear the level of breast damage .
the rec@@ ti@@ fier in the past often have reinforced the rights of prisoners .
&quot; so they spoke only in April a prisoner , red@@ ress , because he was locked up naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 also according to the multi @-@ determination of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin constitutional period , which had an un@@ worthy accommodation in a parallel in November 2009 . &quot;
the then law@@ suit was taken over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cells as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have occurred in the last few weeks due to lack of staff in the headlines .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even too s@@ lu@@ cid conditions , it should have been due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the com@@ press@@ ors , 21 places in T@@ egel are not occupied because of young@@ sters are not occupied , 19 shall fall off . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept them .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers , according to Germany , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are to Germany come after Germany , according to the Sal@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated the face of the immediate challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can create it .
&quot; when it comes to Germany , the following overview is conv@@ eys . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with various proj@@ ections between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the State Department ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , held annually - and over the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built till now ( 250@@ 000 houses ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of a living space but especially in affordable rented apartments : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from the ten@@ acious orientation , and around this particularly favourable housing can also apply refugees . &quot;
&quot; state &apos;s Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore aims to double the promotion of € 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little has to come from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing year , and this federal government would have to invest in € 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
the scientists and the state Department in Germany agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to the estimates of the Institute for labour market research and vocational research , 55 percent of the refugees have been established in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification , to help them start getting started by Claudia Walter , project manag@@ er for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem issues , as well as for the self @-@ esteem of the Zu@@ w@@ ess , says Mig@@ rations researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ aci@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ aci@@ an , it has given a political turn@@ around : from the Labor Party to the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was an employment contract for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , just like the Residen@@ ces accepted for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers , it is also employed in the point of view that refugees should be faster to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing English skills .
&quot; until now , there is still not an extensive offer of general and available language @-@ related language courses . &quot;
research also demonstrate that work are most often obtained through personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore improving by the throne of the König@@ s@@ weg to the working integration .
&quot; the Berlin council administration has noticed that only a few refugees who give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated at least ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the escap@@ ed parents , it is only once important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ en , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of hand@@ paper is disp@@ ers@@ ed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increased by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more technical colleges . &quot;
in the countries pupils are prepared without a German knowledge of welcome classes on classes .
&quot; however , they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; to them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables of the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ances the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
&quot; where of course , students could be facilit@@ ated to the university . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a post@@ ure or d@@ ul@@ sion do not receive any performances after the asylum seek@@ ers Act , when they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter is not given a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they are not entitled to the group of persons entitled &quot; &quot; entitled &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; refugees needed to have lived for four years in Germany so far , to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1st January 2016 , this division had to be shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also these funding gap has to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a major role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should include the same rights in Islam , as they have churches , and to further develop their existing state @-@ churches to form a new state of religions . &quot;
&quot; it is also important for the formation of a Islamic welfare state , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representative of Islam must agree to clear contact persons in a clear and ready to work with the state in many areas and to give them some control options . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the willingness to act as opposed to religious fundament@@ alism can be understood . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , threatened by Thursday the concern of religious conflicts , may also be en@@ registered after Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany , &quot; instantly have their right to so@@ ar here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will continue to be a subject of the whole society even more than today . &quot;
&quot; in this way the Maj@@ ority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism has also been more urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a non @-@ discrimin@@ atory war since a scar@@ ce decade and are part of the equality law .
&quot; but it is slowly learning how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive has been systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rat@@ ory organisations and interest groups cannot call for long and why international treaties such as anti @-@ racial threats must be realised , must be realised over the next few years if the country should be peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany has been able to provide some of the most anticipated refugees trying to medi@@ cally , is as a medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it is extra money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers ordered right in the registration of health cards . &quot;
brought benefits could be p@@ ayed later with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able that many people are dis@@ semin@@ ating with the restricted performance catalogue to the asylum seeker . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors can especially make the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin healthcare researcher The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are more educated about their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical offices , would have to be taken over interpre@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; helped many refugees , but also already with more general medical contact points in the emergency out@@ patient . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; amongst refugee sk@@ in@@ ers , about which there are significantly more untreated disabilities , and among the young people go about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partial amounts of disease , German doctors took from their training to be clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; the paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize . &quot; and what the hass@@ le of damage occurs , be caused by the refugees too , even relief in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system that are several refugees or even doctors .
&quot; in order to practice it , however , they would have to test their qualification and be ex@@ or@@ bit@@ able again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany , after estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ ace National Bank ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most patients suffer from a post@@ injury or depression . &quot;
&quot; particularly vulnerable as refugee sk@@ in@@ der , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by TU München shows that every 5th Syrian refugee camps has been trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; he is suffering from a post@@ injury @-@ load disorder , suff@@ ers from amongst others in so called Flash@@ backs with air@@ not , di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess and de@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleeping and con@@ stri@@ ction , thick and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms are chron@@ ically needed , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ical sufferers have received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mental @-@ sick people can ask for asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social officials , mostly Sach@@ be@@ worker or doctors , who are not trained for the mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the cir@@ cus is focused on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group in the construction of fascinating batteries , hair@@ dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the cir@@ cus invites to the riding on a tile and was@@ p to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie , Animal World Teacher and Jun@@ i@@ orch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current de@@ generation of de@@ generation .
for over 33 years the cir@@ cus has been the hands of the family for over 33 years .
so the gift to delight is his family in the blood .
&quot; we are very important to take away people away from their everyday life and take them for two hours into a totally different world , empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year Jun@@ i@@ orch@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; trans@@ du@@ cock@@ tail with world @-@ flair &quot; , &quot; so CEO Reinhard tried his concept . &quot;
50 cities in the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can see this flair .
the program of Circus is convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family attracts the public with wit and charm in their spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the pieces of pieces it wants to absor@@ b the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - in these words they identify themselves .
your humor@@ ous art by the m@@ ast is to conquer women in storm .
except by numerous black sal@@ ts the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the cir@@ cus tried also with finger@@ tips and joints .
with the unic@@ ycle on a sphere ?
for He yuan no problem .
sl@@ ender people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
w@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest design of the ac@@ rob@@ atics a little other and fascinated by its flexibility .
60 vic@@ tions from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ anies mother , Brigitte . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the post@@ ures of circulation are only too often the subject of various animal rights organisations .
&quot; Stephanie , is also taking a stand : &quot; does it not go well to our animals , it also does not go well . &quot;
&quot; around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a string , unit . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , the possibility of every wish is read from their eyes . &quot;
we want to work together with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel at ease , it does not want in the ring . &quot;
the top Command@@ ment is therefore : good for the animals care .
&quot; specially on their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ ank Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ ebra @-@ mare , the family is prob@@ able . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a housing for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte tried . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the riding arena , but for this it is the unique mas@@ cot of the cir@@ cus . &quot;
so for each visitor something might be a bit there .
&quot; one is safe , &quot; says Stephanie , &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spect@@ ators , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
the Circus test will invite from 17 to 20 September at 17 pm and 8 pm on performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Friday , for the performance at 5 p.m. , prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal is open from 10 am to 6 pm every day . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe is holding wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped from the beginning of the year from a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained in@@ ju@@ red , but the video of the Falls spread quickly on the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was killed also by claims of members of the opposition , they had received anonymous thir@@ ties and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ creating . &quot;
&quot; last month they had spread him and interrupted him during his talk on the State of the Nation to Parliament - this is the speech , which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions will have received SMS messages on their mobil@@ es they warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; the message does come from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists by mess@@ ing speech . &quot;
&quot; it warned the Parliament &apos;s members that immunity in the Parliament , and once they left the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
Chief spokes@@ man said that the party is concerned by the Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i - Party is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the restructuring and saving efforts in the services of the company .
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
&quot; expected seating final leads to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , who shall direct the unity of separation . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more foc@@ ussed than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies as transition to a new style of the business - &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand@@ alone company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ pro forma revenue and is dedicated to providing so far @-@ reaching technology solutions for companies so an explanation of the company .
&quot; it &apos;s a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard , to produce elec@@ tro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the hom@@ etown of the Silicon Valley &quot; . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to tackle the recur@@ ring of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech firms , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies achieve a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates just have to stand behind the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Less than Wil@@ sh@@ ere stressed that it was first of September and provided its rehabilitation to plan there , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss over the next four games for England and certainly , in view of its history , its involvement in the next summer and European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the great shame at this actual problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere was badly finished the last season after a separate k@@ nu@@ cle@@ ation injury and then disappeared again to its old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone , who is not well healing . &quot;
it is not a major task .
this was just an accident .
there was not in connection with his kne@@ es or against injury he had previously .
&quot; this may be true of purely medi@@ cally view , but as little , as well recognized , there is the per@@ taining danger of other injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study conducted by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd is characterised by 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut appearance six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ al of 157 Lig@@ per in the last five days .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two prime minister League clubs could have recorded the most injury @-@ days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but arsen@@ al believes that improvements in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an acci@@ dental period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win the fighting force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it , and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and the Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
pr@@ one can also begin with cl@@ oning Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Qu@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and players who need it to get a little off @-@ off , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal won clear favor@@ ites , by group F to return , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is among the players with the most inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also sl@@ ammed after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , whereby the Lev@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala were measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn up the teaching of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and stays with its management to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al tri@@ umph@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this impulse is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy @-@ Show that gave us serious lessons for men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows are obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now even more des@@ perate than ever has become , like su@@ pre@@ ven@@ ats among young men at a 15 @-@ year multi@@ och . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death case for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in stri@@ ving to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mission ( calm - campaign against a li@@ ru@@ diment@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of a man , with the aim of asking the culture into question if they need to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed sym@@ toms asked that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient large percentage of friends with &quot; healthy spirits , &quot; his chances of recovery ever doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellec@@ tu@@ ally friends are the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one has to have friends so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media communication , with their emphasis on style through substance , in@@ medi@@ um@@ ability of the response is often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear to be strong , funny and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists extrac@@ ell@@ ular values name ; money , image , social status , everything at cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a video @-@ invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
&quot; the Beautiful at Friends was , that foc@@ us@@ sing placed on the head . &quot;
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , who glo@@ wed through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , inst@@ alls at soccer gu@@ at in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can definitely stay , even if they often with@@ hold back completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the phone contact I explained to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and are self @-@ reli@@ ed , really revealed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
males who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; I come at dealing with &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows , which comes to mind if I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot;
it will be clearly presenting the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone to help people in ey@@ eb@@ rows of desp@@ air may also help , long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest when you visit the Day completely new designed scenery , then do not take your friends into a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see somebody sitting on around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello to him . &quot;
one never knows what difference your friendship might be .
friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Mary meets to help PS@@ G to sk@@ m@@ Malmö
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Bes@@ son Cav@@ ani to his hit against Malmö .
di Maria met at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to visit Malmö .
here are the report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and spoke his course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain , his Champions League season started with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Hun@@ edo@@ ara on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ bit as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the road , but afterwards , they watched a number of opportunities before they finally hei@@ gh@@ test their lead , than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ gate . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters , because they are not only stri@@ ving to qualification for the fourth round turns , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points it was not a classic trial of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s , became later in the game against his native Croatian team and against the association , with which he started his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to gain our opponents &apos; problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have still perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; &quot; said Mont . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
we wanted to win and we won because I regret it that we have not scored one or two more goals .
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ pp@@ le returned after his injury in any of three changes in the Paris team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 oun@@ ces at his own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine Fl@@ anders had been referred to as the man who has taken the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he went into the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated that when he went to Marco B@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ col@@ on &apos;s defense before he closed to Johan Wil@@ der beautifully in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but someone believed that PS@@ G was a great victory , that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; in Malmö , Celtic hit a play @-@ off to reach that level stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was set up with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass far to Kevin Tr@@ ackers P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered a little in the assault . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself got sometimes on , with some mis@@ eries and bad abdom@@ en , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in no less than five attempts alone in the first half of p@@ atz@@ mann and then abandoned , after rel@@ o@@ wed him after writing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out a lot more skill when he took his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , the Di Maria turned into a shooting , which turned by Wil@@ der in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the pole . &quot;
the second goal was finally shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Fal@@ ay@@ er thus achieved its sixth stop by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c a left @-@ fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended up all thoughts that Malmö can come back into play , and only one excellent input of Wil@@ ders from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the end result relatively before sub@@ play E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi saw a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ le@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish League that did not have the same level .
the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core gath@@ ers 2.5 billion dollars by shares
&quot; the mining industry in Switzerland Glen@@ core , who is affected by the raw materials prices , gathered around € 2.5 billion in stock value as part of his huge school rede@@ mption . &quot;
&quot; the del@@ ine @-@ registered company Glen@@ core told in an explanation , that new shares sold the value of approximately 1,6 billion £ , to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value , fought with the raw materials prices , because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn increases and dis@@ astro@@ us in markets . &quot;
the edition of Be@@ cat@@ chers put Glen@@ cor@@ es Stock cuts in trading on the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase at the top of the London stock exchange .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed around 2,@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 100 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Glen@@ core had last week the 2,5 billion dollar shares last week , some of the most comprehensive plans to en@@ su@@ ed around a third of its 30 billion debt to debts . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2 @-@ percent discount on the closing of the hose on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9,@@ 99 percent in the group . &quot;
&quot; concerns relating to a long @-@ term growth in China have decreased king@@ prices by about half of coal , coal , copper and other commodity prices by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Wei@@ mar
&quot; on Tuesday , 49 people after a mostly long run reach the city administration in Wei@@ mar . &quot;
&quot; the refugees came from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;
the most recent starter is a six month old girl from Syria .
the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; the Chinese President of Xi Jin@@ ping is to make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is first official in Washington , will take place on September 25 and commented President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just some years ahead of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at that time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times of Spanish champion , three times champion champion , four times champion world champion , two times champion world champion , two times champion champion , two times champion , the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;

and the only registered office of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; remember@@ ing : in summer 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ dians was the reason that X@@ avi did not release altern@@ ated
but the change came not about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ bet has taken Guardi@@ ola from the contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P has said to me that I would not change the team without being able to imagine .

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in the film
Matt Dam@@ on argu@@ ed the af@@ ru@@ American fil@@ mm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she was not required behind the scenes .
&quot; during a Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , considered this the need for alternative perspectives , and in terms of a black prot@@ agonist in the elected screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about variety , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ ag@@ ated sho@@ cked and called a wa@@ hoo ! Wow . okay . okay when the comments from the actor of The Mar@@ tian brand@@ ed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ cers of Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ h@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the fil@@ mm@@ aker - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
the only black person and she is a n@@ ut@@ te that is taken by her white ascent .
&quot; the producer von De@@ ar White People was prepared for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting @-@ rights to the film , which could give her direction &quot; at the end of us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; when the discussion was aired , the social media has explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval about Dam@@ ons comments . &quot;
&quot; Mr Po@@ oni was expressed his anger via the clip by giving him &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - it &apos;s SO P@@ IN@@ K that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 employees since his release . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ ons comments come at a time when accurate , racial representation in the media stands at the head of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement achieved Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s nation@@ wide action and ur@@ ging leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colored inv@@ ent . &quot;
in February the singer Prince began playing a stake on the movement during the introduction of nom@@ ination albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums also still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leader of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter has published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was found on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media landscapes that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portr@@ ay@@ al of the Catholic Church in the west . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .

&quot; professional sport clim@@ ber and operating assistance Well Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which was just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a contest participants , which could close all levels of its obstacle course . &quot;
during the season glo@@ wing there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman ge@@ off until getting to the final . &quot;
its last task was the climbing on a 75 feet long Kl@@ etter@@ rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; ride ended the task within the time , with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the hard phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after hard , victory , still under shock about profit of the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never deser@@ ved more than 10,000 dollars or have been &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; he said about his p@@ ile Money . &quot;
just as sudden as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the Chief Financial Officer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter , to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten had ended up first at all the par@@ cours , not only a prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money is transferred to the fastest . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he will have some res@@ ent@@ ful about it .
he has just been so fortunate to have done what he did .
it won the crowds of awards by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad he is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac was just as comfortable if they had changed the roles .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak at Minnesota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; in earlier times , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today , the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ k@@ ile , but they played out this part on Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 @-@ target Field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance to asc@@ end within a period of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ Card square .
&quot; Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to put away over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tors have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon held his early offensive support , founded in Detroit three times in the first two internal years , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth day . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ation and enabled three rap@@ us .
it was only his third successful launch in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the Bull@@ ant@@ elop@@ es each game , and therefore I will concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ us to his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July . &quot;
&quot; it has weigh@@ ed the head@@ board well , &quot; said exhaust . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( ambient side ) , it looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three acts in back@@ bone at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ ding Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton stops the inning with a double on the left sky@@ line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ ici@@ ans to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Lef@@ thand@@ ed Har@@ dy Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ riding wall , the only man with whom he has been facing , in front of the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Rookie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who had a god @-@ run rotating clo@@ ister . &quot;
a pair of runners and the closing of the second Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ps to a Double Play .
&quot; it was the major league held 27 times in this season , that plague down a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; since Detroit added a Insurance project at the end of the ninth place , an R@@ BI double @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
the right @-@ handed sm@@ s but S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited for the shooting of the game of a still not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ us in the first two internal paths against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed before the game from the viol@@ ability list , after having been missing more than a month ago . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es &quot; , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more at ease when I released and felt that I would do some pretty good pit@@ ches , as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought to game by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , playing a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the runner in the Scor@@ ing location .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right hand side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game than he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second , scored one One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not work very well , but he did the right job . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was found in a Pit@@ ch count , recorded no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever rec@@ ant A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three hits at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez was divided because of an injury to the throwing school .
he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws to re@@ construct the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since mid August on the viol@@ ability list , is supposed to be activated for the launch on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the viol@@ ability list is removed to start the tw@@ ins . &quot;

hundreds of refugees to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; among the activists , people are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden , on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it calculated with 450 to 750 in@@ coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Polish state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can be temporary there . &quot;
it shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days alone , we had arrived at the last ten days of the decre@@ e responsible government decre@@ e &quot; &quot; found@@ ries 7@@ 500 people in Hessen . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have been furnished in sports for the large number of refugees in Spor@@ th@@ allen .
Ischgl : German military intervention in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a chance . &quot;
&quot; I think the deci@@ de@@ dly thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he thre@@ w the European states to &quot; collective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago it was very happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military participation in Germany has been passing .
&quot; now the conflict is wearing before our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for massive suspension of international aid for refugees .
Austria controls the south and eastern borders
Austria has introduced Austria again in its southern and eastern borders .
&quot; the Austrian inter@@ iors of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station OR@@ F , and now no one will be returned . &quot;
&quot; also , Germany has received no refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement , after the Germany , a certain number of refugees from Austria would pick up a daily number of refugees from Austria a day , I said a specified talks between the position of the General Security and Foreign Office of Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers they did not tell and dismis@@ sed the talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit for next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint approach to the crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new attempt for a binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees in a special event . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first up@@ set and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will be held together with the countries , announced at the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ time consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel lined that people , the prot@@ ru@@ ffs , conf@@ esses this too . &quot;
&quot; but those who do not have a lead @-@ perspective , would not be able to remain in Germany too . &quot;
this view was generally issued in the lap .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole , must now manage a &quot; huge force of force . &quot; &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees already stuck at the Baltic route .
&quot; in the night , Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on the night . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border to Romania , even the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the tug@@ boats out across Romania , said Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new Grenz@@ z@@ au@@ n . &quot;
the Romanian government shared the plan immediately .
there were first det@@ en@@ tions of men who had passed the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , tens of further migrants would be reporting on the road to the Greek border . &quot;

&quot; therefore , the moon sett@@ les easily on its way around the ring plan@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this bar@@ mel@@ ting movement is only small , but still too big for a consistent and steady sphere , it is said in a Communication at the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( U.S. state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers make their analyses in the &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; . &quot; &quot;

here rain continues to hold on Thursday night .
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be counted into the next 48 hours with part more than 100 lit@@ res of rain each square meter , after in recent days we have already noticed great rainy days . &quot;

Rome has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther site
just under 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square .
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a little place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , was bap@@ tised in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill on the name of the German reform@@ ator . &quot;
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ is@@ e@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the working @-@ community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants have found its faith in the city of the Pop@@ es about centuries as a minority in the secrets of her faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic mode , it is evident that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome will be welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he was the city then as a ab@@ om@@ in@@ able sin .
&quot; in his negative impressions , his negative impressions should be conquered by historians in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Lu@@ ther then had his th@@ eses about the distr@@ action against the distr@@ action of the foreign church .
hammer artists : three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( the gol@@ d@@ rought ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces that Oth@@ mar Old for his Bible has painted .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and scripts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared to be sum@@ p@@ tuous pictures now . &quot;
in the beginning the image for Ot@@ mar Old was formulated in 150 things his completely personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and on canvas .
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms the 75 @-@ year @-@ old get - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , that may be quite gri@@ m . &quot;
&quot; about three years in Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he had a subjective artistic selection from the many fields of &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these cycles are created , which are subject to issues such as cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; so he also fascinated quite a number of partners , this applies to the Lu@@ ther publisher with his the@@ ological outlook as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has been on the basis of painting , with the respective be@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tions selected by Ot@@ mar Old Fil@@ ed and thus into today , &quot; translated into current connections . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like ban@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
&quot; nestled between the original Qu@@ at@@ zi@@ es of Martin Lu@@ ther and one of the artist , who have formulated his very personal thoughts for the respective situation here . &quot;
the jewelry Coll@@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ ex@@ pi@@ ous medal . &quot;
&quot; then the education took place with the pi@@ on@@ stock , &quot; remember Ot@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to dis@@ continue working , in order to perhaps return to the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art in a faster time again : &quot; &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is now marked by re@@ acting , and which is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have another lust and bl@@ iss to show things .
images are always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants that the viewer will come in the pictures on &quot; &quot; come , &quot; &quot; and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is seeking to be counter@@ parts . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began to be at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; as always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art , &quot; I like , how he m@@ apped with his images . &quot;
&quot; I have not been advised to grasp the Bible completely , but that is selected for it &apos;s major , including mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures and the text merely says . &quot; he created a picture of Scripture . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Lu@@ ther Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ v@@ ases - is presented for the first time in an exhibition presented on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans have been made , place found , company commissioned the modeling for a round trip : one year later everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration with care for susp@@ ect , especially among residents who wanted to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill was ported , new place to be chosen - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the approval was going to enter in October was the first community with Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
then it should be started without a &quot; further mem@@ ep@@ rint &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B increases its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga supports a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
the soccer likes to re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and ensures its policy with the aid of tackling the problems that lie ahead .
&quot; I consider this to be the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no one in principle to say , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting to each of you to get this subject under control , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ MD Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and meet the Chancellor of the Chancellor Angela N@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; there will surely be a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive white must be policy .
the German Football @-@ federal government has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &apos; 1 : 0 for a welcome &apos; to four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation we ensured that this program runs through 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some leaders also support this program .
already this weekend we &apos;ll put the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a a clear sign when taken on the left @-@ head mu@@ st@@ ard instead of the usual sponsorship @-@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) - we will help - # @-@ es@@ welcome .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ sman Ru@@ di V@@ ö@@ ller the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and drew the plans as a &quot; self @-@ course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every need , neither must it be taken away . &quot;
&quot; we can state the state of football , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly low , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ int@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ ina spoke of a &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a European Quali@@ fier game against Hungary at this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ers@@ bach referred to the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; a large communal area of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ ence have started their own projects in their places would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; that we spent in football will be lived in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of huge importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year the association provides together with the DF@@ B selection , and the federal government at 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs can also retri@@ eve the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; Un@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Board @-@ Board loses a eye in an accident
&quot; the Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports by a down@@ fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; the accident at the St@@ eps in the House of his brother in the USA may he fallen down after midnight on a tum@@ bler that he used in the left hand , the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , he was impot@@ ent , then went out to@@ wed out on the road - this he has told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ forms . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go up to his work .
&quot; in early October we meet on the super@@ visory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; he said . &quot;
the 54 year old manager would involve the meeting and &quot; fully @-@ fit &quot; at the meeting .
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t held in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday afternoon ) , he will come back to Germany in October and leading to the software . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got all the time in a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German head office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; whether it is important to go with such personal history to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; everyone can happen to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot magnesium except moder@@ ator ...

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Tor
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us were final in the first group game of the Europe League . &quot;
the national representative will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 clock / sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ es on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top@@ o against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach will be open to : &quot; we expect to return from him to the Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high loading of its pros , Tu@@ es will change his pedi@@ ments only at the ep@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place by the en@@ ders Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teachers the world master . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in future in all Europe @-@ League games , however , Tu@@ es left open . &quot;
with a high degree of probability it will also be able to pun@@ ish the second round .
&quot; the for@@ nic@@ er statement of Mit@@ te@@ er Re@@ us , that the Fin@@ alist inv@@ ade for the BV@@ B in Europe League has its aim , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Sor@@ gl can be trac@@ eable : &quot; &quot; this Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the cutting edge for Germany
Germany should be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner following the will of the German government for the changing of the car technology .
&quot; the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday , a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things can be seen in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ les said on Wednesday in Frankfurt , at the edge of the &apos; Autom@@ atic I@@ AA &apos; from a &apos; new &apos; mobility period . &quot;
&quot; the automated driving , net@@ worked traffic , will increase road safety and ensure less stur@@ dy , said do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives from the industry at the I@@ AA . &quot;
the strategy paper of the traffic Department reports among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band engineering and very influ@@ ential ur@@ extent on digital radio .
there is currently a test circuit on the 9 in Bavaria about the testing of new technology .
&quot; to ensure that the driver does not arise extra det@@ ention to the driver , &quot; the German government wants to examine the legal framework &quot; , &quot; where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany is about to use an internationally operating maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 km / hour . &quot;
&quot; the federal government is also intended to use the Vienna Convention for a change of the Vienna Convention , which has so far been described as a driver . &quot;
&quot; at the automated driving , the car takes over as a leader , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to one from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the study acceler@@ ates is highly automated driving to motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads spend far short after 2020 . &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany value the study of the study for 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital inter@@ connectivity of the cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD member Advisory Board S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability for accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers has to be clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test @-@ Institute &apos;s mandate comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that sufficient cars are expected in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect just 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents said to 2025 with aut@@ on@@ ome cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely leave on an independent vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a digital network collection of Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would agree to complete control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway that can nevertheless imagine 15 per cent in flowing traffic , in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; good every fourth would leave under no circumstances to the car , under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to present the current state with the title fight from 25 September to 4 October only in single .
the final decision should be dropped by September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strong enough to also win the title with Timo by the title , &quot; said Jo@@ ab Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ Project in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term arranged Sponsor@@ ship Pack@@ min in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the draw@@ back , we are now no longer a clear favorite , &quot; stated mat@@ ern@@ ee Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the ch@@ es@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but reminded me of the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo has also been missing , and we are masters of Europe . &quot;
&quot; for this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world &apos;s out@@ source . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant ...
it is a combination of quite large fashion show and a w@@ ax@@ y@@ pair of w@@ rist@@ bands : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) announced an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which creates thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , which among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ nen@@ out@@ fits the great star of the Mo@@ star @-@ scene - and thus that he put men inside the skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was so easy , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th September to the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a bit of luck that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed its beginning to a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he had been against it , for , &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit by death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
once there dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made this impressive collection in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; this is about as much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the little still looked at the man &apos;s work , which has written mo@@ de@@ history without ever completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured but it is a great chore@@ ograp@@ hed overall bi@@ work , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ ise the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material have hin@@ ted the flat@@ ter according to the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special treat : a le@@ ather@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
&quot; he is for the first , timi@@ d training attempts of the designer . &quot;
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) he attracted his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and dres@@ ses said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
&quot; playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the dismis@@ sal of fashion he turned on to himself later on .
&quot; he studied fashion journals and saw themselves the dra@@ fts of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier was told in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it but of course .
for his first own fashion show he could not pay the Models .
&quot; they got nothing , they were allowed to keep the sh@@ am@@ ots . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s tip as a fashion
formerly it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ ies in and around Pl@@ auen about yards let .
&quot; the embro@@ ider@@ ated substances and tips were created in large amounts for customers , for example to blank@@ ets themselves for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , CEO of the Mo@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is very important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s peak , fashion has played a major role , then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewellery , accessories such as bags and for regional tractors . &quot;
&quot; even the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , who re@@ jects with past engra@@ vings , an increasing amount of order . &quot;
who is not served in the Tex@@ tile industry in Germany is no longer available in the market .
they already made half of all the orders .
Mon@@ desp@@ air Pl@@ auen is part of nine other companies member of the sector @-@ association Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s top and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they should be allowed to bear the proprietary label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of the sales are dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
and even the wholesale market is nearly no longer .
we hardly can reach our products on this road .
&quot; the mass goods are now much cheaper in the Asian region , and is distributed nearly exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; weak@@ ened the export , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; branch companies also tries to score on environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ du@@ la Bauer managed by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; from this year onwards , we have a seal of quality , which shows that we produce ecological and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the used materials . &quot;
a Master @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaches at the snow @-@ mixed coverage of the West@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ y and l@@ aces .
in order to counter@@ pose a competition from the Asian region one needs to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a cross@@ breeding between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories that must be in mind , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to hold a customer base . &quot;
some years ago animated textile jewelry Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic snow @-@ tip brand new .
&quot; at the same time , the machine attached to some places small chic@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ d@@ smith &apos;s award in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ li inspired himself , &quot; I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for her jewellery .
&quot; in an elaborate processes , they shaped the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , after Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors used in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , and would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s tip .

XI pushed to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Bank Group on the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; re @-@ start promoting and implementing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and provide new place for economic growth , Xi &apos;an . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for the provision of market access , relaxation of the border controls , to resume its border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents @-@ Mel@@ des@@ system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement a neg@@ atives list will be identified , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of significance , since it as@@ serts the market a major role in the al@@ location of resources to guarantee a legally @-@ state business environment and open the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government also has control over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to manage their business .
it also stated that China limit the border areas to explore new models of trans@@ national economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; in the context of a supply , state @-@ controlled sectors become open , further areas for private investments are opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will enhance the legitimate interests of foreign financing and deliver better services to them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to request by the requirements and the evaluation process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , to exercise their activities , and professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li K@@ qi@@ ang and important guide like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli particip@@ ates , as was reported in one after the meeting published . &quot;
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury event in car@@ el@@ fish
the European Commission want to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large rob@@ ber@@ fish and consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is presented a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans cris@@ p : &quot; risks and side effects fail , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt report@@ edly , the threshold values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ing for big fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or sword @-@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; has been up@@ lifted by one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury ever kil@@ ogra@@ m fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big rob@@ bery @-@ fish have already been stra@@ ined heavily by mer@@ cury that can not be sold on the basis of the valid threshold values about 50 percent of the str@@ ands . &quot;
&quot; after the dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14,@@ 5 percent can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants to reinforce the threshold values for other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch was referred to as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller bur@@ ial @-@ fish , such as carp usually are so low charged , that they already comply with the planned limits today . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant of distr@@ action , which helps the economy by the economy &quot; , &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; Mercury is a high @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous metal , which has become strong beyond the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishing . &quot;
the German government therefore warned that &quot; some small quantities are to cause especially in the inf@@ illing of the nervous system .
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment is explained on its website with regard to the current requirements of current affairs , but is not expected to be a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general public &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Mercury is obtained above all through the coher@@ ence into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Finance , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock increased more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount of products in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish about in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; durable and &quot; &quot; surface &quot; &quot; in March , which quoted a &quot; mirror &quot; in March , dating from the paper . &quot;
last year featured war@@ nings about mer@@ cury in fish have already been one of the most common health risks in the EU @-@ Warn@@ em@@ ing Area RA@@ SF@@ F .
