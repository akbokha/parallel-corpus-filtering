&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting point ( tablets ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , a psychological disorder and sp@@ anning of things which are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and other reasons ; • Bi@@ eber @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psychological disorder , in which the patients man@@ sions ( periods of non @-@ non @-@ smo@@ kers ) have a normal mood . &quot;
&quot; it is used to treat patients suffering from severe pain to severe anxiety and prevention of patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients suffering from patients
the injection solution will apply to fast control of increased o@@ unces or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the drug consumption is not possible .
&quot; at both diseases , the solution can be applied to the test or the melting @-@ tab@@ let@@ tu@@ tion for patients , which prepar@@ es out of tablets . &quot;
&quot; patients who are able to use other medicines that are being built into the same as how to do , the dose should be adapted to the dose . &quot;
&quot; this affected the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; ne@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , &quot; . chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l is probably probably known as &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the rec@@ ept@@ ors for the ne@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;
dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ pol@@ arized disorder plays a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and their return will be prevented . &quot;
the effic@@ acy of how to prevent the symptoms of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
&quot; the effic@@ acy of inj@@ unc@@ tion solution was performed in two trials at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which compared to increased accidents , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a further study , dest@@ abili@@ shed over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effectiveness of dest@@ abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent access to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; the effic@@ acy of dest@@ abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ pol@@ y disorder , which was compared to increased o@@ unces ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , change in patients with a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder , or the number of patients treated to the treatment . &quot;
the company led to examine studies to investigate how the body the melting @-@ tab@@ let@@ ins and the solution to take the solution .
&quot; in the two studies in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients suffering from 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg , a significant reduction of symptoms than the patients who were a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder increases in four of five short @-@ term studies in four of the five short @-@ term studies and plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to 74 weeks , more effective than plac@@ ebo inv@@ ests in patients with previously treated patients and when it was in addition to a existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is also effective as plac@@ ebo @-@ inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg capsules more effective as plac@@ ebo , and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly used side effects of dest@@ abili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , he@@ aters , bl@@ ends ( sc@@ aff@@ ection ) , vom@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ he@@ es ( sc@@ aff@@ ection ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( sc@@ aff@@ ection ) , ti@@ red@@ ness ( sc@@ aff@@ ection ) , ti@@ red@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ atic ( sleep disorders ) and ang@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that the advantages of schizophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ serious episodes during the treatment of schizophren@@ ia , and during the prevention of a new man@@ tra @-@ I @-@ disorder , and when the prevention of a new man@@ tra ... &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee also came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of increased risk and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ia @-@ I @-@ disorder when a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable for risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission sent the European Commission to Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . &quot;
&quot; when patients were shown in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l , ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for dest@@ abili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once every day is independent of the meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness of Do@@ si@@ bilities via a daily dose of 15 mg , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for dest@@ abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effic@@ acy of schizophren@@ ia in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder was not detected in patients with 65 years .
&quot; in regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis should be considered if clinical factors are justified ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ zz@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see paragraph 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some cases , psych@@ otic illnesses and aff@@ ection@@ ate disturb@@ ances and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder was not increased in patients with bi@@ polar disorder ( Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l should be applied to patients with known car@@ cin@@ ogenic diseases ( M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ al infections , cardi@@ ovascular disease ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , a year or less perme@@ ated , there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; when a patient treated treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ies should be observed , the dose should reduce the dose or treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed into a M@@ NS or a clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including dest@@ abili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l in patients with cr@@ amp@@ sin@@ ks in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at home , which are used with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ ings in connection with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old ) with neu@@ rop@@ sy@@ zo@@ l in patients with patients suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l patients have been treated to plac@@ ebo compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , however , in one of these studies , a study with the current dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ic events are treated with Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases , extremely , associated with K@@ eto@@ osis , or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Com@@ a or death , was treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic ingredients . &quot;
there are no exact risk potential for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ oriented events with dest@@ abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic medication treatment .
&quot; with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) , patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a reduction of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; in general , patients with bi@@ pol@@ y man@@ ia are known to patients with bi@@ pol@@ y man@@ ia due to bi@@ pol@@ y man@@ ia because weight of anti@@ psych@@ otic diseases , which result in weight gain and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ zz@@ zo@@ l at the central nervous system , if Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l in combination with alcohol or other central medication is determined ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 Ant@@ agon@@ ist is Fam@@ ous , a magnet @-@ acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l at 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective optical inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ e@@ tin and par@@ ox@@ e@@ tin , similar effects , and therefore should be similar to D@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ induc@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; using C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; December &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm can result the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Standard Met@@ aboli@@ sm . &quot;
&quot; when using the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , it should be considered potential for the potential benefits of potential risks for the patient . &quot;
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV proteins may also be similar to similar effects .
&quot; after set the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of dest@@ abili@@ fy the dosage of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ap@@ op@@ ram , or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ shed , can be used with an increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
clinical trials showed 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l per day no significant effect on the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of the sub@@ strates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( Dex@@ tro@@ phi@@ de @-@ R@@ atio ) ; 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ bud@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( Dex@@ tro@@ phi@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( Dex@@ tro@@ phi@@ de ) .
patients should be able to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to insufficient data base for safety in people and due to the reproduction of the animal studies , this medicine may not apply this medicine in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patient should be warned , dangerous machinery , including power @-@ vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l can no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects were frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical side effects ( * ) .
the frequency of the bottom of the side effects are defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study on 52 weeks came to patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ d@@ zo@@ l , a total lower In@@ ci@@ ism ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;

abstract Judicial Review of Stat@@ utes ( BvL ) ( Number of result : 1 ) July ( Number of result : 2 )
Ac@@ tos is applied to treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ induced diabetes ) . • It can be applied to patients with a different di@@ ab@@ duction ) . • It can be used together with a different Di@@ ab@@ et@@ yp@@ sy ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to Met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially significant patients ) are applied to patients with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a Sul@@ liv@@ ec@@ oms or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of Sul@@ liv@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ els or ins@@ ulin can be retained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ect@@ s or ins@@ ulin is reduced . &quot;
this means that the physical body can be done better in better way and the blood glu@@ cose levels should be better .
&quot; for more than 1 400 patients , the effic@@ acy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated . in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ ta@@ ine , in addition to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which indicates the blood glu@@ cose levels of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study showed the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ amine in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo to a reduction of 0,@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , which was investigated in the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin at 289 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin inj@@ ections , a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects in connection with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ function , infections of upper respiratory system ( cold ) , weight reduction and hy@@ po@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos should be applied to patients with liver problems , even in patients with liver problems such as liver problems , cardi@@ ac disease or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ osis - acid or blood flow - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos is not shown as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients with met@@ form@@ in patients .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission sent the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited an approval for action from Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved , and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , their blood sugar with ins@@ ulin in inadequate , and with those met@@ ering in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatible . ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
patients who start by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. fruit juice or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) should begin to increase the treatment with the lowest possible dose and increase the dose of dose .
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart failure , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight loss , weight loss , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on can be applied in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a car@@ cin@@ ogenic Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ sc@@ opic disorder was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase of reports about Her@@ cul@@ inity , which was not meant to be an increase of Mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; patients with increased risk of liver enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper boundary of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used for Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror up to 3 levels of the upper limit of the standard range , the liver cells are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms are developing , such as un@@ think@@ able nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , de@@ hydr@@ ation and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver cells of liver cells . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the process of clinical assessment should be directed by the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was a dos@@ cope @-@ dependent weight reduction , which can be observed by fat deposits and in some cases with a liquid degradation . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ isph@@ eric , among the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a slight reduction of the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ mat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative value of 4.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; similar changes were observed in comparable controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ mat@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ mat@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ mat@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of increased risk of ins@@ ulin sensitive , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale 2 @-@ way therapy therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ amino acid or two @-@ term therapy therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ cope @-@ dependent Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including the appearance of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ o@@ de@@ ms with a reduction of visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occur@@ rence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ics , if patients should be aware of a mac@@ ul@@ a@@ therapy , if patients may be considered to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a combined analysis of messages of messages of messages from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;

patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient has a pregnancy or use this entry is the treatment of treatment ( see paragraph 4.6 ) .
studies have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have a relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ic@@ in , War@@ ning , Phen@@ om@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medication that are ter@@ med by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contra@@ c@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clo@@ por@@ in , calcium carbonate and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ induc@@ tors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with mix@@ tures ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) results in an increase of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to ensure the 3 times .

this is due to treating a treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance in pregnancy and increased the availability of the metabolism and reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic rate .

&quot; the new release of the new &quot; &quot; change &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so set out that one of the effective parts immediately and the other slowly set up over several hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze will apply to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic reactions ( ha@@ y fever ) in patients with nose @-@ inflam@@ matory effects .
&quot; in adults and youth from 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze twice daily a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose . &quot;
treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medication is based on the nose of the nose .
the main mes@@ hing dimensions were the changes of the hypo@@ crit@@ ter symptoms which were observed from the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients showed their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and improved with a standard sk@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
&quot; in consideration of all the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except the nose of the nose , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze symptoms , over a decrease of symptoms around 4@@ 6.4 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al transplan@@ tation was considered , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were investigated . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer ( cardi@@ ac ) , oral pain , pain , pain , in@@ som@@ atic ( Sle@@ eping ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ronic , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al active substances or Lor@@ at@@ opic ( another medicines to treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also be applied to patients who suffer in patients with a disease ( increased water ) and hyper@@ tension ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( over@@ function of thy@@ roid ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( over@@ views of thy@@ roid ) , or a risk of blood circulation . &quot;

&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ low the whole . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the absence of data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see paragraph 5.1 ) not included in children under 12 years .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after removal of the symptoms .
it is recommended to use the application time to 10 days as long for long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ sis depends on time .

&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic urine was examined for further forms of urine , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is based on different forms of path@@ ophysi@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients . &quot;
&quot; since the history of history is a different factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ aria is also reflected in other forms of urine . this will be confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on 6 weeks for patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine , A@@ eri@@ us is effective in improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the Her@@ cul@@ ature &apos;s size and number of squares at the end of the first roofs . &quot;

a insp@@ ections of some of the study centres showed that the study is not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .

&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be determined only if the doctor tested , which has been tested , which has been corrected , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus has been taken to the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily .

&quot; however , AIDS cannot be avoided , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drug , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which were not treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ iness . &quot;

&quot; the Committee for Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that the advantages of A@@ chem@@ ase in application in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medications for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ chem@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers , but the committee ordered that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have no prototype was not detected . &quot;
&quot; A@@ chem@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited to information . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission sent the European Commission for Gla@@ xo Group Limited , an approval for the in@@ box of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is available in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medications for treating HIV @-@ 1- in@@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ mer ( PI ) treatment and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for example , A@@ chem@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ sts of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see Ab@@ brevi@@ ation 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r should be made under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bending feet of the Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is as a solution for insertion is 14 % less than of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ chem@@ ase capsules and solution can be ex@@ changeable at a milli@@ gram of milli@@ gram ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ chem@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with a 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al vir@@ al cancer .
2 If aph@@ ro@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sts ) must be applied to A@@ chem@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ chem@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medications until a daily dose of 4@@ mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded . ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effic@@ acy and safety of A@@ chem@@ ase in combination with low cans of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not examined with children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ chem@@ ase is not recommended for the application for children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ chem@@ ase capsules should be reduced at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ function on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be done with light or moderate liver dys@@ function , in patients with severe liver dys@@ function ( see paragraph 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ chem@@ ase cannot be used simultaneously with medication that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; herbal supplements , St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) are included , due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ al@@ avi@@ r ( see paragraph 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be aware that A@@ chem@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not affect HIV infection or other complications such as HIV infection or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti @-@ vir@@ al therapy including the treatment with A@@ chem@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for example , A@@ chem@@ ase capsules together with low cans of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medications ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C , and with an anti@@ vir@@ al vir@@ al therapy , have increased risk of severe liver problems with potentially fatal consequences . &quot;
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ vir@@ al treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please read the subject information of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including an chron@@ ically active h@@ epatitis function , an increased frequency of liver dys@@ function , and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ ca , which are not recommended , it is not recommended , it is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment of system@@ ically cor@@ ti@@ tig@@ o@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and support of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see paragraph 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the reduction of the H@@ MG @-@ CO@@ A @-@ Re@@ induc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ ulations are strongly recommended by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended for simultaneous risk of my@@ opathy including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For a few medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects , such as Carb@@ ohydr@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycle anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and warnings ( under monitoring of the International Monetary Union R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the drug concentrations . &quot;
&quot; patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ chem@@ ase can be less effective ( see paragraph 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolism with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the effic@@ acy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time , the patient should therefore be monitored at the same time , the patient should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ opic symptoms , especially if there is even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the increased risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high de@@ hydr@@ ate solution , this dar@@ ling solution will be applied to children under a age of four years , and should be used with certain patient groups . &quot;
A@@ generation should be set up to Dur@@ ation or allergic symptoms of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .

&quot; for patients ( type A and B ) , which have been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ iness , reports reports about an increase of blood vessels , including spontaneous views and hem@@ isph@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the introduction of an anti@@ vir@@ al vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ inflam@@ matory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resistant infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or degradation of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ disciplinary approach is accepted ( including the application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ ity , higher body analysis , and / or long @-@ term application of an anti @-@ vir@@ al therapy therapy ( ART ) . &quot;

&quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined together with drug products such as C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and for increased plasma cutting with serious and / or life threatening effects . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r caused to lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical disorders and a resistance .

&quot; a do@@ cking recommended for simultaneous translation of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra is not given , however , it is not known , however , it is not known to be known as the effic@@ acy and un@@ think@@ able of this combination . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use A@@ generated images in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , but due to the component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase at least one hour ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ets would be low . &quot;
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin pin on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ets and existing limited data can be identified that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin the Ser@@ um concentration of am@@ al@@ avi@@ r may occur .
&quot; if this medication is used to be used , as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ire less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a detailed predic@@ tion of the combination of am@@ al@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
simultaneous translation of the Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ vera u@@ tin led to a rise of the plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ p u@@ tin to 193 % and thus to increase side effects with Ri@@ p u@@ tin &apos;s side effects .
&quot; when it comes from clinical reasons , Ri@@ vera u@@ tin together with A@@ chem@@ ase , is recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ p u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ chem@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin could not be carried out , but the plasma cutting of both medicines could be increased . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg F@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was once a daily basis to increase the C@@ MA@@ x by K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ az@@ ol .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below are listed below , including sub@@ strates , Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ generated images . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with A@@ generated images . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable to be taken to be taken at the same time as A@@ generation . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ tic ) , with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r can lead to an increase of plasma cutting . &quot;

&quot; the simultaneous translation of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , it is not recommended that the possible benefit of the risk of a treatment system@@ ic corro@@ sive effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ MG @-@ CO@@ A @-@ Re@@ induc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ at@@ ine and Sim@@ ulations , whose fuel @-@ changing of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent on the demand of plas@@ tici@@ des at the same time . &quot;
&quot; as plas@@ tici@@ des of these H@@ MG @-@ CO@@ A @-@ Re@@ induc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines are not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic dosage to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ cli@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see paragraph 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ chem@@ ase cannot be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see paragraph 4.3 ) , during the application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;

&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on together with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ul@@ arly symptoms , especially if there is still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low weight reduction of historic vehicles , there may be no recommendation , such as the Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose can be adjusted when am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r at the same time it is possible to use meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
( see paragraph 4.4 ) for simultaneous removal of the IN@@ R ( International Standard Series R@@ atio ) due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or reinforcement of anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ating effect ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
&quot; the effect of an additional fee of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ sts is not expected , therefore alternative methods are recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amin and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amin and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) is a negative expert in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C received by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ectors . &quot;
this means that Alph@@ eon a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same oral @-@ effective component should already be used in the EU ( also &quot; reference implementation &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ tic@@ ised ) h@@ epatitis C ( one by a vir@@ al infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue occurs , the values of liver tissue is increased in the blood pressure ( AL@@ T ) in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was produced for the formation of the drug .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon , which consists of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of medication by means of effectiveness , safety and effic@@ acy of h@@ epatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with h@@ epatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon is compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment in the blood .

&quot; furthermore , it concerns concerns that the data to stability of the active drug and the market are not guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C who spoke to the treatment of Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients again than at the reference implementation ; also Alph@@ eon more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , in the study of the study of the question , how the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it may be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with rice infection ) and small in@@ surg@@ ents ( cracks , cutting , cutting ) , de@@ duc@@ tions and gen@@ otyp@@ ing waf@@ ers . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used to treat infections or probably due to meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients at age of nine months as well as patients under 18 years ago the skin surface is not more than 2 % of the body surface .
&quot; in case of patient after two or three days , the patient should investigate the patient should examine the patient again and alternative treatments . &quot;
&quot; it works through block@@ ages of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ses ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and hem@@ med by the growth of bacteria . &quot;

&quot; in these two studies , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is caused by ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( egg @-@ filled hollow ) or of infections , which have been caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a friction of the customer .
&quot; the Committee for Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go to the course of the result of the result : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , the infected small defects , de@@ duc@@ tions or gen@@ ders . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years .
&quot; the Ambi@@ rix is used in the framework of a two @-@ existing vacc@@ ine vacc@@ ine , with a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be reached after the second dose . &quot;
&quot; from this reason , Ambi@@ rix only uses a low risk of a h@@ epatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ine can be carried out of two cans vacc@@ ine plan . &quot;
if a dri@@ ve@@ away from h@@ epatitis A or B can be given , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis A@@ - or B @-@ vacc@@ ine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines influence the immune system ( natural immune to the body ) , &quot; how it can become a disease . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox will be applied to patients suffering from patients suffering from a PCI , a higher dose , and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this may increase in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; for 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at any of some gifts or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a other medicines which was compared with the conventional combination of an@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient was frequently used a st@@ ent , which is used in the Ar@@ ter@@ ie , to prevent a closure of blood vessels , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; at the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - when the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart disease or re@@ ask@@ ular@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year , as well as the conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a PCI bus , An@@ gi@@ ox was observed in relation to all indicators such as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy blood , when it was considerably more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or other parts of other parts . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who had been applied to patients who had a blood pressure , as well as with a strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Human Physi@@ cians ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that An@@ gi@@ ox at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in is .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd was an approval for the In@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ ist ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ron ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) , if an early intervention is planned . &quot;
the recommended initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by a in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; in case of the patient in other result , an additional Bol@@ us should be given an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after the PCI can be reduced by 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by a in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for duration of the period . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ al intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt action of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the security and effic@@ acy of a number of Bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
is this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to 225 seconds should be made up to 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower @-@ lower values , the re@@ generative and fertili@@ zation before use carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis can be used quickly and used for intra@@ ven@@ ge@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring cannot be required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is correct . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney function ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be used with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n against ACS or not ) , should be used for a lower price rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
the ACT @-@ value under 225 seconds is a second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis of 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis again .
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney disorders , which led to the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , was included in the study 5 minutes after the course of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us without D@@ os@@ is@@ --@@ at the average of 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot;

patients are carefully chosen during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood in combination with other anti@@ bodies in combination with another anti@@ bodies ( see paragraph 4.5 ) .
&quot; even when using PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , most blood vessels can occur in patients who occur to a per@@ form@@ ative cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation ( PCI ) , while the treatment principle may occur throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the warts are treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a monitoring of the IN@@ R advertising should be drawn up to ensure that the value is reached from the treatment of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n . &quot;

heavy blood vessels have been defined after AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i for heavy blood@@ lines such as in the foot@@ notes by table 2 .
both light and heavy blood vessels were significantly less than in the group with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dated plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; a AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy blood circulation was defined as one of the following events : in@@ surg@@ ents , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular pressure , or blood pressure at the point of ≥ 3 g / dl without obvious blood circulation , reduction of blood products for trans@@ fusion , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;

&quot; the following side effects that are not listed above are listed above , according to extensive application in practice and are divided into table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n is immediately disman@@ tled , and to monitor the patient training in regard to signs of blood pressure . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ge , which connects both at the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in a liquid phase or to Ger@@ m . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is re@@ formed , because th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in part will be generated by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , causing the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated . &quot;

diabetes is a disease in which the body is not sufficient ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin lu@@ lis@@ ation is very slightly different from al@@ in@@ ulin in@@ ulin and the change means that it is faster and a shorter active time has been a short @-@ effective approach .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; type @-@ 2 diabetes , with which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra has been investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance in kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in blood , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; in the first study with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % of ins@@ ulin . &quot;

A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin lu@@ lis@@ ation in or one of the other parts or in patients who already suffer from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra has to be adapted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that may affect your blood circulation .

&quot; due to the reduced carbon con@@ dens@@ ate capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin , the ins@@ ulin needs may be reduced to patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - Exchange ) , the ins@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normally , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can make a change of ins@@ ulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or treatment of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ sive diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ osis ; these states are potential life threatening . &quot;
the adjustment of a patient is required by means of a different ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should make a change of the dosage .
the time of occur@@ rence of a Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change the treatment of the treatment schem@@ as .

severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ phs with consciousness can be given by an in@@ appropriate person or sub@@ mitting inj@@ ections of glu@@ cose ( 0.5 up to 1 mg ) which are treated by a doctor or intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of gluten .
&quot; after a gluten sensitivity , the patient should be monitored by the patient in a hospital to determine the urine - to avoid severe hy@@ po@@ ker@@ at@@ emia and similar games . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ulin , reduces blood glu@@ cose levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral muscles ( especially by ski muscles and fat ) , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glu@@ cose in the liver . &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ lery T@@ be of ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ lis@@ ation in the field of ins@@ ulin .
