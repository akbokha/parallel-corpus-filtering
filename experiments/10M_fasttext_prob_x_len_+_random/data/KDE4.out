met@@ adata are defined as data via data . met@@ adata are provided according to your definition data which provide information about or a documentation of other data which are managed by application or environment .
&quot; when you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , you need to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t know how many photos you have to save a particular photo . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know before you have to be organized by anyone in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; quot ; Be@@ aches that you have to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . you can also be happy with this structure . you can quickly take the images from the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will be able to publish a folder as &amp; cover ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , working processes , constant access from images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files are not new . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ amping processing easier . separated by old files .
you will always know if you are looking for a original or a daily picture .
&quot; we recommend the met@@ adata of met@@ adata in the settings page of the met@@ adata in &amp; quot ; it is sure that Ex@@ if@@ - and IPTC data in the file are written . if you forget this , you can store the met@@ adata from the database by using the menu . &quot;
now you have a lot of information in your database but what happens if you want to change what happens when you want to change the met@@ adata editor . these are of course the most important .
&quot; now , the real work , as you are now able to focus on each photo sharing , labelling and evaluation . of course , you can start all images that need the same attribute , and then start the value . &quot;
&quot; all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you want cat@@ alog@@ ger images from another source with embedded fonts , then &amp; quot ; automatically switches the pictures to the right place . the sort of hier@@ archy within the building is no problem and can easily be done through the drag of a sub@@ station to another . &quot;
the graphics shows how different met@@ adata are cut out . this is a very coarse representation as each block of met@@ adata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data is like all images .
enough of hints - the next section refers to labelling or comments about the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ es your met@@ adata .
&quot; you want to see most of your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure you are interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panoramic view . out of it &apos;s not even a nice beach holiday . if you look closer to see , then let you see some details on the people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say you this at the Lan@@ de@@ square of the Allied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha beach , in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y @-@ 60 years after landing . &quot;
&quot; for others the picture may look more important than the picture itself . if you want to show a story . remember that , the key is to be transferred to the viewer to help Him through the motive that you understand . &quot;
it is in order when a picture is not perfect if it is the strength only with a labelling for itself alone .
&quot; you can export it for a selection of images at the same time , you can export it for a selection of images at the same time . &quot;
&quot; you will remember the times before GPS ? as you had to find the other city without a navigation system ? it was not a boring planet of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , as with images , the train of the spatial presentation is now working with light speed . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure that one day , in near future , you can easily change the images with geographical data . I &apos;m sure that one day , in near future , you can also export a photo with geographical data . &amp; quot ; can also export the pictures to the gallery y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , which can be exported to the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and referred to the copyright rights , to remove limitations via the distribution and change of copies . &quot;
the following description provides you what information in the furnishing page of &amp; quot ; as information is displayed :
&quot; the name of the photographer , including the name of the photographer , the name of the photographer , the name of the photographer , the name of the photographer , the name of the photographer , should not be changed to the name of the photographer . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of the photographer , the photographer has to be filled with the author . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer for a news agency , use the vendor field to identify the photo : if the photographer for a news agency , then , these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a storage picture , then the group / agency shows the picture . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this no protection against misuse . &quot;

&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the street or fire . this type of loss is the same that you can do with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
K@@ roll @-@ Track is the largest data recovery company in the world , some interesting statistics which may have a data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these pre @-@ treatment will be treated and you may not buy longer than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ quality . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ quality . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can also use this risk . the best DVD recording devices are not much better than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective for errors , even if you only have written a control mechanism to use . 75 % of the data are only effective , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and the control . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there are a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that will be available to CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is currently available under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there is also similar applications that can be damaged by damaged disks , hard disk , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six sm@@ al capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything comes to CDs and DVDs , of course , also for Blu @-@ ray Disk . &quot;

&quot; this is only a complete loss of loss because of over@@ voltage . of course , you can also make use of data loss because you have done the files , but these losses are usually removed without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices you do not have a lot of electric devices , you can take advantage of the device with computer games and high @-@ speed transmission process . &quot;
&quot; most commonly used protection against electricity is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that contains a part of the energy consumption and the rest . it is usually available in form of a plug @-@ in connector . however , it is normally in the form of a connector bar . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay the UL 14@@ 49 Standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
this also applies for telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms since it is also possible for telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms because they also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; during an over@@ voltage protection , your system can be used to invest smaller fluctuations in the current lines . it can therefore be useful to invest a few seconds to the loss of unwanted data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a lower @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection of over@@ alls , these devices automatically allow you to store battery energy . &quot;
the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to your computer system and compare it to the cost to prevent this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be exposed to less than less than euro .

the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says if a transmission error occurred , not when this happens in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable network parts are a further source for transm@@ issions , as they generate inter@@ change@@ over within the data flows . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently unable to look into the future , you should look at the future . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates , which can be used with plate errors in low level and highly scal@@ able . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;

&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the master . it leads to a less damage , than theft or new installations ; and it is currently on Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no more sc@@ aled . &quot;
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as a proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS as well . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the process process during a operation is higher and an un@@ defined status . if a file is not stored before the problem , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat for digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main reasons for data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ tures by fundamental physical limits . it is that during the technology there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise levels are not far removed from this border .
&quot; current cameras go in direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even when this resolution is very high for compact cameras and the final result , a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimization of the compact cameras ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk will get more than 100 % of all PCs , so you do not have any other for data loss in every year from one data loss . make sure your data often be affected by a plan and test this protection before you do anything like the new installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of the hard drives . &quot;
&quot; allow you to make every day every day , one day , a lightning , you have not been connected when the drive in the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a des@@ aster ride goes locally and destroyed a lot . forget the aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they are usually a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use the stairs to the stairs to the stair@@ case , into the neighbour house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above mentioned , is an essential reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a problem with the history and represents a complete copy of a date .
&quot; differential pressure : a backup of files which have been changed since the last day of the last day , it creates a complete control of two time points : the complete backup and the last differentiation . &quot;
&quot; you can set up the original status of any time that has been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status to any time . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful tool that you can set up on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfers or other types of file transfers . this happens automatically and if you want to increase safety via s@@ sh .
secure key images directly after you stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; this approach allows you to re@@ discover a daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly fix for at least one month and a snap lock for each month . each other di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have done a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , in the image file stored IPTC information , associated with images and met@@ adata , copy of images and met@@ adata , copy of pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... , usage of the internet . &quot;
&quot; in order to survive the next 40 year , it is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future of your nature is un@@ predictable , you need to be aware of what today is said to be able to be compatible with the current system . all 5 @-@ 8 years should be compatible with the current system . &quot;
this question should be answered with the explanations of this document . use or change the open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for each application . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is simple : each time you can change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size .
&quot; if you want to copy the scal@@ ability using the scal@@ ability , and the range you want to enlarge on a de@@ coded disk or partition . &quot;
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new plate has been recognized by the system but they don &apos;t want it .

open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software more you can read this itself .
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that disappear slowly from the market . they should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is a free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of free compres@@ sion@@ ment sal@@ m ( Def@@ end ) . there are now more than 50 different types , and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; it is based on the TIFF / EP format and it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to use of met@@ adata . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use of met@@ adata for Canon and Nikon . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and we hope to use the Mit@@ ter@@ ber Canon and Nikon it too . &quot;
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has been introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; image resources file size , and a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is provided with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ g ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; X@@ MP indicates a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , because it can store the met@@ adata separately from the met@@ adata file and the image file , and as above mentioned above , it can be used to use as a container as a container . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is a open organisation that supports a large range of applications and business models , a large range of applications and business models , for annual conferences and workshops , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections , and self @-@ explan@@ atory efforts to achieve a wide range of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures of the camera , card reader or scanner . so long the images on the camera &apos;s camera can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
you are currently converting raw files to DNG and store these in your raw material . this function is not implemented .
&quot; for a hostile processing , you can use external programs . if you have to add the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ als , then you should add the met@@ adata again to the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the printed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ pages , use it in MPEG , use your contact form , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos in &amp; quot ; you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ dious , connect these with the computer , switch the camera on the display mode and switch it . another description is available in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , try to connect with your camera . if the connection is produced , the file names and a symbol for the file is displayed , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you need JavaScript enabled to view the camera features and met@@ adata from the camera interface . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored on the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture is not available on your computer . note that the picture is not available on your computer . note that some digital cameras will not be available .
&quot; the met@@ adata fields shows the internal met@@ adata as well as thumbnail , manufacturer , GPS , etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata side bar from the main window of &amp; quot ; or the jQuery Slider . note that these met@@ adata are not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button and then click the selection of all photos .
&quot; if you want to download all photos , you can only use the default sizes of &amp; k@@ de ; select the pictures that you selected the button and then download the button . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; you can download the album from the list and press the album from the list and press OK . details on the folder , select the album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; quot ; , the photos of the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . &quot;
&quot; note that there are no possibility to delete the photos you want from the camera , to delete it from the camera . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame can be used as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos of the camera , if you want to set up photos of the camera into the same album . it can be useful to integrate photos of the camera into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate photos and the time when the image has been done , in the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you can find options for the Dre@@ amer and Spi@@ ders of the image and for dat@@ ory @-@ based sub@@ strates . if you use this latter option , automatically be created a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options is to transfer the data to the list below . if you choose this option , the corresponding entries will be copied from the author to the author in the default fields . if you choose this option , you will be corrected the corresponding entries from the Profile to the IPTC fields . &quot;
&quot; if you wish another file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % M . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option file name , you have the possibility to change the file names in small letters . or in large numbers , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts ; for a photo , will be stored below the name , the camera will be stored in the preview . &quot;
&amp; quot ; can all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of the camera in order to implement an automatic rotation while exercising . not all cameras ensure that information that has been embedded into the photo .
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera is not supplies , you can use this information , use the button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of window window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera information is done on the date , where the photo is done , it can be used to download the photo album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub @-@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case store &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button the button and select the option file in the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to download their camera is to download their camera is to download .
&quot; after the image selection is done , you can check the images . select the images and press OK to start the high load . the images are not deleted by your computer . &quot;
GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document .
&quot; not only for professional phot@@ ograph@@ s , it can be interesting to get a picture with an accurate geographical location . not every use a plane , in order to generate a territory by automatic recording of the GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graphy . environmental planner , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agency can be used . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser that shows the area of the photo . if you want a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ dious , it is good to document the location of the photos , it is good the positioning data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how the GPS data entered into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card files are supported by using the correct hardware , via a re@@ machining of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera that has been integrated with GPS receiver . &quot;

the download of GPS data from a device can be used with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ c . you must save this information in g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format that is supported by the geographical order .
there are various programmes for Windows and Windows ; and Mac OS which can be used by images and from GPS extracts and can be used . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you want to know the length and wides@@ creen or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pres@@ sur@@ ised coordinates , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least on French , German and Spanish , all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . in order to access this settings , you need to select the settings in the menu settings . you can select between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; you can select a list of jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to add a new FTP site by clicking &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; to the right of the &quot; &quot; Publish to FTP server &quot; &quot; drop down list . FTP Location Manager window will appear . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , like below shown , the standardis@@ ation of data and analysis data . this data will automatically be written in the relevant IPTC data fields when the option is written in the IPTC fields . &quot;
the title is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the professional name of the photographer .
&quot; for example , a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this must not be the author to enter the photo . &quot;

&quot; with the setting PNG file , you can reduce the size of PNG files . &quot;
click Start ! and you can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window .
&quot; with the setting of low @-@ free JPEG files , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than at normal JPEG . when this article was written , the met@@ adata was not supported yet , was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; the default setting is that all green pixels are equal to ultra violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is a bit soft , but the 2x@@ 2 grid patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white use is used . otherwise , the white color is used . otherwise , the color balance will be used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , which was based on a white card which was based on a white card which was based on a white card . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras .
&quot; the standard is the peak , so the parts of your pictures have been added to the settings . use the setting color , as well as cut white into the settings . last , you can try some parts of the missing information from the peak to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , as blue pixel is not as fast as fast as green and red . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; you will probably have a little higher than the standard 1 set . this can also be done later than the standard 1 set . this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts ; it can also be used later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;

not all profiles are created on the same type . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some examples like Canon that does not contain colour ton@@ ne or gam@@ ma@@ unc@@ ture . this means that you have to perform the colour ton@@ ing yourself .
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can print a smaller colour area as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that colour profile is provided for Canon . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion makes the style for the aim : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for wall and S for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;

&quot; the reason why one gets a coloured workflow is that the colors can be printed from your camera or scanner , which can be printed from your camera or scanner or scanner that you can print out of your camera or scanner or the colors that you print out from your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; if the theme of colour management is , then , everyone wants to express what he wants to express what he wants to express it . unfortunately , colour management is to provide you information about colour management . &quot;
&quot; if your picture shows all six of the listed criteria , then you have to take care of the colour management . &quot;
you work on a monitor of the s@@ RGB colour space in the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
the only other picture issues are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
&quot; so , if s@@ RGB it works well and the life for all so easy , why should I use another color space , and so that thoughts are to make the thoughts about colour p@@ ng ? &quot;
a visual sample of s@@ RGB compared to the colors which we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional character of all colours that we can see the h@@ uts of the region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger Far@@ es , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and then click on info and then on Information About Us Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to convert to my monitor when I decided to work in the RGB color space ?
&quot; yes ! if you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to convert your monitor to s@@ RGB color , then you must either use your monitor on s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ zed , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve the image in most cases . use it , before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions are standard , Ab@@ same , automatic adjustment and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction will try to make a correction of your colours . they will need to be able to see the best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method is scal@@ able to change the light intensity of the entire image , so that the dark @-@ point is so bright as possible without its color gel . this function is often a mag@@ nific@@ ant correction for images , dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is a very powerful operation that has the same number of pixels . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of a image , sometimes it is possible to change the same number of pixels . sometimes it is a very powerful operation that has been destroyed by a picture or it was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic Ab@@ use : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the red , green and blue channel . you can determine the dark and light @-@ wise , and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete Hi@@ sto@@ v area . &quot;
contrast : this method improved the contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of a image by setting the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; quot ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white @-@ correction correction is a bit limited because over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color .
this tool is based on a white balance sheet and protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ick . it is protected by the menu items of white or the jQuery Slider window .
the tool@@ box can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the tool .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel is displayed as vertical line in Hi@@ sto@@ gram .
&quot; on the right above , a Hi@@ sto@@ cy@@ gram is very helpful as soon as you can change a parameter . this Hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well @-@ illuminated pictures , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ants values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow and satur@@ ation and g@@ amma .
&quot; an@@ stat with the above mentioned controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then set the color temperature of the white colour . this way the temperature and green -@@ values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you can set the white below with the list of pre @-@ settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
this is shown in the same way as a colour channel of the pixels . it is shown in the same result in the white below . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons are saving and loading exactly this . each setting of the white below you can save you in a text file and later again .
the button settings sets all filter values again to their default values and the related neutral white color . note that also neutral settings can be changed as your original image . if you save this save it will be changed your original image .
&quot; you can set up the co@@ di@@ verter depth of the printed image . 8 @-@ bit code is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit code , and is better for high quality images . this encoding requires more disk space , computing time and stands for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialogue like the processing of raw material . it uses the change and use of colour profiles . colour ton@@ ne can be performed using the sub @-@ window profiles to rate the chapter colour management .
this tool provides an integrated way to store multiple colour channels simultaneously . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple colour channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings .
a very powerful option to fix problems is the tool for the gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ ves in the menu .
&quot; &amp; # 039 ; s &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar , also the effect of the image of a short flash light , and afterwards the development of the image has been replaced by the additional light . this is the effect that the light areas are dark@@ er and the colors by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
the intensity is controlled by the solar power . at about 50 % intensity indicates the image of what chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally a negative image that does not create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the Solar@@ is@@ ance portfolio . the original image is the ( 1 ) and edited the intensity ( 2 ) . applied intensity is at 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filters can simul@@ ate the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that he makes a more powerful contra@@ sting effect , the colors are brilliant and smooth . try it simple , he ver@@ ing lots of photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and this is a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated .
the original filter is controlled by Neon@@ light on the contra@@ di@@ ality . the parameter level controls the brightness of the parameters and the sliding layer repeat the thickness of the body . the filter can be set the entire CPU for a moment .
&quot; digital cameras have often problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the colour control of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment may be satisfied with the tools in the menu , you can use the button O@@ k and you are applied . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a photo with bad light conditions , you can reduce the change problem : a great choice for brightness / satur@@ ation . in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce the changes in the preview . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ ves and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool can be used for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the fields of the layout . &quot;
the left side represents the dark and the right area . the left side represents the dark and the right side to the bright areas .
the easiest way to stop operation is to move the control and to make sure the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adjusted using the settings of the image , updated on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; size : with this selection box can set up , whether the Hi@@ sto@@ k with a linear or logical Y axis , the linear hi@@ sto@@ ogram of a constant colour is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ ening of a single column is a single column . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the left for the dark tones , the middle of the bright tones and underground for the middle tone , often gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three shades cover can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the size of the shade , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : output values allow for each field . there are also two switches to change the output values for each field . the compression of output values can be used in order to create the output values as background in the background .
automatically : with this button the image values are set automatically into dependency between the intensity values of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons can be stored in the file system and later loaded to the Gim@@ p file format .
&quot; if you want to use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ings , the input values are automatically adjusted for all the shadow , medium and sun @-@ t@@ ints . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette for Rot@@ - , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ants channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ flow indicators controls all colour channels to find and find the combined result of all channels , i.e. , you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect in the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example for alignment of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side , the half of the origin@@ als and the target image is displayed . the preview is updated on the right side , the following options are available on the right side : &quot;
modification : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel of the module :
&quot; in addition to this way , two symbols appear to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic View . for images with large areas of a constant colour , the linear mode creates a wide range of colours . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode can continue . &quot;
&quot; if you move e.g. a cur@@ v@@ bar to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that the bright tones are dark@@ er and that the related image pixel are dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of original photos is a red marking . if you want to change these markings on the curve , will be displayed on the curve , the original value is displayed on this line and move them up to your taste . &quot;
save as and Download : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve allows you to be stored and later loaded . the file format will be stored and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p cur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you want to use this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ings , the curve points of the curve for all channels of Sch@@ att@@ age , Central and sun @-@ t@@ ints . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to set the color points for red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ o . &quot;
&quot; if you want more than one channel channels , you will find the combined result list . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result list , you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect when the final result is displayed . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ating channel . Sch@@ att@@ les and sun @-@ t@@ ints was set up with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and on the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the top of the page Skip user information
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu @-@ color @-@ Mixer of the jQuery Slider window .
&quot; using the channel telephone , you can select the color for the Hi@@ sto@@ gram : this gives you a first note like you can correct the channels by using the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target has a red marker . if you move this in the image , a vertical line in Hi@@ sto@@ gram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and building you will enable you to mix these channels . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour to a visible noise that comes from the same place in colour channel and their synthetic patterns in each channel is different . if the case is , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ ion conversion in each channel . &quot;
the use file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ flow indicators controls all colour channels to find and find the combined result of all channels , i.e. , you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo see in the blue channel . the original image is activated in ( 1 ) and the picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; with the development of digital photography , black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abst@@ raction . with the development of the digital photography is black / white a work step , as colour images can be used on the computer . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ating a black / white film industry with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scenarios and set especially good to portraits against heaven . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin Park . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ating a black / white film industry with a or@@ derly lens . this improves landscapes , play scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin &quot;
&quot; Rot@@ ating : simul@@ ate a black / white film industry with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sound effects and can simul@@ ate the moon phases , so similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( version ) Rot@@ ating . &quot;
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film industry with a yellow lens correction . this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Co@@ kin Park .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium sounds while he adds a bit cold in the shr@@ ink . this is a very similar to the process of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ aton@@ er . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fier ; tool text , you can apply a decorative tex@@ tures on a picture . &quot;
&quot; using adding a text to your image , regardless whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a painting of an old master , a pop @-@ portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . &quot;
&quot; relief : move this parameter to the right , the depth or three @-@ dimensional character of the text on the image . &quot;
a paper tex@@ tual is applied on the photo below . the original image is shown ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) .
the frame is to add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , you represent the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce is equipped with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , ab@@ rupt it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value of the width is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have the same page aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of pictures , especially if you use the tool . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use and place it with the mouse . use Text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting , which you have chosen for your text , can be changed until you are stored on the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image is saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed . &quot;
you can set a template for a template on a picture .
the menu image template can be used in the jQuery Slider window .
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to add image slider . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to add your Sch@@ ab@@ bey folder with the button basic folder in dialog . select the folders button to select the folder files in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the templates , a building site is set up a construction site that reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ loss@@ berg folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview there are three buttons , where you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button filler the lower picture . check the position of the mouse button . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; small : this button refers to the image of the image . if you want to use the template on the whole picture , you need to use the image accordingly . &quot;
move this button to move the picture below the template . take this picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; if you want to use the template on your image , the image will then be adapted to the default size . &quot;

&quot; a traditional tool for shar@@ pening is a traditional tool for the shar@@ pening . it is very fast and simple , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ dient images . &quot;
&quot; you can use the contrast to the contrast of the edges to be able to remove a picture , and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gim@@ p and he is protected by copyright protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; Ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ation is the best of the three , as he really improves the edge . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot;
&quot; the same phenomenon does not require a correction of the shar@@ eholder value . elements are usually printed on paper , i.e. the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras need to be printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras need to be printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras do normally need more application than normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to JPEG image , it is often used to apply a camera internal application . pictures in the raw format have to be used during processing . &quot;
some sc@@ anners have a shar@@ pening process already during the image of the image . if you de@@ activate this disable you get control over your picture .
&quot; in some cases , you can receive the results by using a photo with the shar@@ pening process . &quot;
&quot; in general , you should be careful about the edge of the edges of the edges , but also the help of the edge of the edges , but also the noise . in general , you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p .
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ance is a very good tool to remove grinding from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help the image to edit the image of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters that produce radi@@ us and the amount . the default values are often good results , and should be tested . &quot;
the radius presents a lot of pixels on each side of a edge by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ ators .
the amount will set the percentage of the percentage between the original and the required picture of the original image . this makes the strength of the edge of the edge .
&quot; the spon@@ ge value is a break out of the maximum RGB value and the apply differences . you can be used to define a minimum difference between the pots of the above and therefore have been avoided by a soft change between the pots , the heavens and water surface . &quot;
the original image is the ( 1 ) and the original image has been applied to radius = 6.0 or amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ ell@@ value = 0.0 .

&quot; in most cases , this parameter will be caused by a previously un@@ defined filters . if you should use this value to 0 , you may also be able to increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ formers : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . note that the module is very slowly when you select large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
you will be charged as and loading buttons will be used exactly to this purpose . each identification parameter is set to be stored for later and can be charged later .
try all cutting edges , color and intensity of rec@@ orders on the image before you use the module . &quot;
otherwise you should use the module before you can change the picture .

the tool set is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired Art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the initial algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ settings as starter to simplify the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings using the filter settings , you can use the tab and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; Detail@@ view &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this is the preservation of the details . a little value of the details are mainly homo@@ geneous regions and details . &quot;
&quot; the Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value gl@@ itter in all directions , while a value close to 1 is close to 1 only in one direction . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is possible to use the relative humidity factor via all@@ orca p . use this value , therefore , the relative humidity is therefore suitable for the degree of noise in your picture . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is set to value greater structures . depending on this value it is necessary , the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ tles , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat controls : there is usually 1 or 2 from the algorithm . normally located 1 or 2 from the algorithm .
&quot; the angle range is &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : tiny @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ ro@@ cking Alpha . if Alpha small is selected , it should be small . &quot;
you should avoid the value of small 1 set to avoid sub pixel density and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : this option is only low . it dou@@ bles the term . we recommend it to it .
the buttons are saving and loading exactly this . each setting of image errors can be saved and later be charged later .
&quot; it can also be corrected very quickly at work . it can still take a long time and a high CPU load once . you can therefore check the calculation at any time with the button to the button . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see how image errors can be corrected in Guatemala City with a analogue camera . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ tis@@ ation is a very powerful tool to reduce image processing . it uses a protected protected algorithm of Peter @-@ Benz . &quot;
&quot; this tool is selectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts . it may also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ side ; effects from books or magazine &apos;s images . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor technology from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in most cases you need a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub @-@ window details and the sub @-@ window settings can stay in the default settings .
&quot; Radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; this value is set up in the filter box : controls the pixels from the filter down to the front of the filter , if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image can no longer receive the edges of the filter details . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the filter .
light density : controlled lumin@@ ous intensity of the image . we recommend you either color or light density to change a picture . these settings are not controlled by the details of the details .
&quot; color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or light density to change a picture . these settings are not controlled by the details of the details .
&quot; g@@ amma : controlled the gam@@ ers of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which typically are stronger . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ acks . this value is defined as fast as the adaptive filter range , when it is increased , the edges will occur when it is too high when it is too high , the edges and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can be removed and is the recommended method . &quot;
save and loading : these buttons will be used exactly to use . all parameters are stored in the file system you can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how waste reduction in life can change your life . the original image is characterized by ( 2 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . use the solution to be a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture . use this tool to be shar@@ pen@@ ed on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the quality of the tools , it is also possible to reduce costs and reduce costs . &quot;
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ge , scratch , scratch , compres@@ sive images and local errors that makes the content as well as the human eye makes it possible to remove the content as it is also the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the first algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tures using a different tool , the image file is performed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . &quot;
the buttons are saving and loading exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved and later be charged later .
&quot; photo restoration is very fast at work . it can also take a very long time and a high CPU load once . you can therefore check the calculation at any time with the button button . &quot;
&quot; below , you can also be restored as a photo with matching smo@@ kers , .. This module will be applied on a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time has been added to an old color photo that was used by Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is found under ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ fier ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos that are protected with a CCD camera , eight were removed from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi Project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ s . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are a problem , as many cameras with JPEG compression and a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels can be removed , and it is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the dark image . the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright views . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; if you have a old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly into the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defect . &quot;
&quot; first , as in previous paragraph , you should find the appropriate wording of the dark image . please note that the assistant will find the last dark image and this automatically goes to the next session again . &quot;
the picture area and the preview help you to correct the result . the pre @-@ window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select one area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter .
Dur@@ ation : it is assigned an average of neighbouring localities . the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels on the block . for one 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation is used separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all Pix@@ els that have a distance of 1 from the pixels can be moved to a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear equations ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear equations ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear equations ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear equations ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear equations ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square meter ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square meter ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square meter ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square
&quot; k@@ ub@@ im : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ic curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) , which then uses the defective pixels on the block . &quot;
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour picture from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been added to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is found under ( 2 ) .
&quot; a tool to fix the V@@ ign@@ et@@ le correction is a tool to correct the v@@ ign@@ ing corners , i.e. lower corners , a image . &quot;

&quot; many centre filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 when the filter filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand , which is impossible to keep it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure area of today filters and colour - or grey @-@ stage depth of digital cameras and film @-@ scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ et pump . the tool V@@ ign@@ et@@ le correction does not be used without this filter . the tool is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the V@@ ign@@ et@@ ular correction filter and with three other the exposure of the target . &quot;
density : this parameter controls the degree of light sensitivity to the point of the highest density .
&quot; light strength , contrast and g@@ amma -@@ settings : the editing of a picture with the V@@ ign@@ et@@ le correction , reduces the exposure of the pixels . they must be re@@ achable only positive values because you must be able to increase the settings only . &quot;
&quot; if you want to take a fine re@@ alignment of the target setting , let you want the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma with zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing system . &quot;
this is an example of the V@@ ign@@ et@@ ular correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the corrected picture . a lamp @-@ stronger and contra@@ sting @-@ correction was also performed at the picture with this tool .
it is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lens to photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des treated the general geomet@@ rical geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can be corrected or kon@@ v@@ exe form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ des has a similar currency effect , flat but at the edges . this correction will not apply in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners positioned to the second Gra@@ des . if you can combine these two geomet@@ rical symbols of virtually eliminated .
general : this value is controlled the thickness of the comp@@ lexi@@ ties of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected and positive values are formed and positive values .
&quot; corner : this value is controlled the strength of the broken gra@@ des . this value is more stronger than in the middle of the image . for most lenses has the &quot; corners &quot; parameters of the &quot; corners . &quot; &quot;
zoom : this value spl@@ its the image size and leads a correction of the first gra@@ des with negative values during positive the image .
light : this value reflects the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to find you the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview of the distortion correction . &quot;
&quot; if you use an image on the top of the page , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to help you to help the best correction , this tool offers a vertical and horizontal line line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . &quot;
&quot; if you have a k@@ ink @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image of black corners . they can remove these with the cutting edges of the jQuery Slider window or via the zoom control of this di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; for most of the pictures from the next logical step , the next logical step for some motives like recordings of front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the view of the image in the image 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with the hand , you will always keep an easy removal of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example for the eye @-@ shaped correction of a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ations of infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ belt of the G@@ imp@@ etus . the filter is produced by the known IL@@ F@@ ORD ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the section for the preview . if you move the red rectang@@ les with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set up two parameters to set up two parameters to set up two parameters of a high sensitive film . the ISO controls change the amount of the film @-@ light and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ op@@ hy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; since the filters colour channels to produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not apply to the effect on black / white pictures . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of infrared fil@@ m@@ suit on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is found under ( 2 ) , and the sensitivity of the film was placed on ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of A@@ ura in the peak . &quot;
&quot; the short@@ wave is a simple tool to use film @-@ gra@@ fts , like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of films to increase the sensitivity of films . &quot;
&quot; the treated picture shows a certain mood or seems to be back into the past . if you want to use this special , Galerie @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ ined , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you will need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the control , the ISO sensitivity can be adjusted to control the intensity and gran@@ ulation of the b@@ ner k@@ ali@@ es . the default value is , although often higher values are required to apply to ISO @-@ 2400 . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film @-@ relief effects on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and worked out ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; quot ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of a oil painting . it uses a protected by copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; for example , the oil paintings of oil paintings have a nice look like a oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two ways to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush is a better for great pictures . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the oil paintings . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) , marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Gl@@ it@@ ator 17 . &quot;
&quot; it is helpful if you want to define a carbon . it is helpful if you want to imagine what scene you would have chosen to start yourself . this would be good pictures to start to start . this would be good pictures to start to start .
there are two controls with a total section of 1 to 100 to control this effect .
the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the result can be improved by adjustment of the intensity of intensity .
&quot; as well as filters , filters engraving your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was used in wax , it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter is a fast tool to give your images with a simple structure , where colour is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture in a gray , mon@@ gering landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example for engraving @-@ filter . the original ( 1 ) and the selected picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in an art work using the distortion effects . it uses a copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;

it is ideal to create a romantic and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for making a romantic and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for making a romantic and subtle design effect .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
&quot; for this reason , there are no events scheduled during this period . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ k : share the photo in rectangular cells and created it , with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p on your picture .
dri@@ p size allows the size of tro@@ p size . as the dri@@ en@@ size is not automatically activated with the size of the image . it is often necessary to reduce the size of the drop .
&quot; you can keep up with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing system , you can use the option to keep the selection of reg@@ ression . use the selection button to switch off the area , e.g. a face , the free will remain free of reg@@ ression . &quot;
this is an example of Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) indicates a quiet sunset and the finished picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset on a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; when the photo is the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or shoot into the right orientation . &quot;
photo gallery is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture is simple . the large question is , how can you find a picture of the image and the details ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can change the desired size using the tool size and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to make the bag . &quot;
&quot; many image programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size .
page aspect ratio : if this setting is activated if the input of the new size is defined by the original size of the original image .
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is set to value greater structures . depending on this value it is necessary , the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ tles , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons can be saved as and loading exactly . any insertion of the photo can be saved as text file and later be charged later .
&quot; photo slide show is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load once . you can take the calculation at any time with the button button . &quot;
you can see below a sample of the photo gallery by a small colour picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 2 ) is the result of linear default settings .
&quot; the image is not only a often guided operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to create a photo . the jQuery Slider allows this very simple to use a photo with the mouse button and select the right button , then you will see this right corner while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the right mouse button , the field of the photo is cut off . thus , you can enter the size of the right angle by clicking on the corners of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting button , you use the button the button button of the jQuery Slider window into the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the view area , you can change the size of the right angle by changing the corners with the mouse . the page aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool box , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the bigger value of the height and the width is assigned to the width of the width . &quot;
this means that it is always a relative aspect ratio . this means that it always is equal regardless of whether you are cen@@ timet@@ able or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side ratio .
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons to select automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; below , you can use the Max . conversion button to the maximum possible to the maximum possible , depending on the selected structure and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool is displayed as standard ratio as standard values are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be restored and not the original image . &quot;

harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of the simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division of various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the aper@@ ture of a sunflower seeds . it occurs in all possible ways of ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the gold division is the irr@@ ational number of 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have used the golden statue in all times , when you use your images , buildings and even more photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number goes from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i . 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc ; &quot;
the golden middle of a liquid form is available when you start a picture .
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party power , the golden spiral will follow the golden spiral line along the line along the spiral stair@@ way along the line of spiral stair@@ way to this type a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule , the right corner of gold spiral , also called gold tri@@ angles . it should be something that the eye can be used in the centre of the composition . it should be a line that the eye can be used in the centre of the composition . this may be a line to be able to be able to fulfill its task . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , the middle points of the gold tri@@ angles are in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles . &quot;
if you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame the effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try your picture focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ cks .
the horizontal horizontal lines and vertical lines can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic characteristics .
&quot; with the button colour you can adjust the colour of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . &quot;
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to turn any angle onto any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , then it happens easy to use the camera does not hold a vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture that &apos;s the things around a angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the sliding angle . the values on this rails are available in degrees .
&quot; for your help , the module has a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor into the picture show , you can move it with a pressure on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; after you will find a picture above , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
select one of the following options :
&quot; the option , anti @-@ alien , the image is a bit after the rotation . please note the warning warning . &quot;
all per@@ spect@@ us Trans@@ actions are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces used by the transformation . &quot;
&quot; new Height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces used by the transformation . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ former area .
&quot; at the top right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ former area . &quot;
at the bottom left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ former area .
below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the trans@@ former area .
&quot; according to the adaptation of the perspective , the image has a little space . for single adaptation this effect is small but two adap@@ tations create a double @-@ strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after completing the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes on the corners . &quot;
&quot; the mold tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction , and the other part in the opposite . &quot;
turn your picture by selecting the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can write horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target is displayed on the right of the right .
&quot; to your help , vertical and horizontal line @-@ ends . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the image , the image has a little bit . for a single switch , this effect is usually negl@@ ected , but two so@@ ckets and so that you should avoid this effect . &quot;
&quot; after finishing the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to remove it , it is the picture to cut out of the jQuery Slider window . &quot;
&quot; in most distri@@ butions you can read and write images from your system and in some cases , by type such as these libraries comp@@ ili@@ es , you can also edit a large number of image formats using &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , sometimes they are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is also alien . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ ment@@ um to reduce the influence of these mistakes . in general pictures with this property is better .
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ Ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam depending on the pixels . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ gl@@ ands . as standard is a adaptive , non @-@ re@@ ational method . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray a Stra@@ ps . when the difference between the color values are calculated on 4 , then both pixels can be calculated using a specific additional number of pixels with a total value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels will be calculated : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the short@@ wave method starts with 4 beams . if the difference between the color values are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , the pixels can be adjusted individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the record can be set with the depth value . &quot;
another possibility to increase the alien effect is the creation of smo@@ kers for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering it changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is a experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .

&quot; if you are not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ile , you want to import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ sh@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end . &quot;
&quot; you can import objects from object tree into the editor , to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this add the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the source text in the editor . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eth ; a scene is ren@@ amed . usually this Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the self @-@ view view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the object . do you find the path to your document and the version . it supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; looking for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you have files that are not in the folder of the scene , you &apos;ll need to add the path to these files here . if a file in different paths of the library is common , the first used file is used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for the display of the selected control points .
the colour of the right angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type .
you can set the object position on the R@@ aster menu in the context menu of the wire model views .
&quot; for some objects such as the ball , you can set up the detail of two directions . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; this property creates a better projection for extended projection , all the projection of the projection with exceptions of the perspective and the vertical projection . this property creates a better approach for the project , but requires more time for ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; when you view the wall , a wall behind the objects will show a wall behind the objects . the wall is presented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you view the ground , a floor below the objects will be presented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you activate the edge of the scenes , the non @-@ re@@ ational Anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to set the values for depth and sw@@ ell@@ value . the values for depth and sw@@ ell@@ value can be set up . more precise information about the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change the window of the window . in the section window , you can create a window and store the window . &quot;
the combination of the standard window works : displays all existing windows and p@@ po@@ v@@ ature ; used the chosen window fix@@ ture at the start of the program .
a new arrangement can be delete all existing windows . a new arrangement can be delete using the button and select a selected arrangement with the button .
&quot; the name must be clearly indicated by the name . the name must be clearly , and may not be empty . &quot;
the list under the name shows all the page@@ views for the chosen window . new views can be delete using the button and select selected views with the button button .
&quot; the position of the new window will create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with in@@ sured . &quot;
&quot; you are currently converting &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ aul@@ er ; installed and now , you will start with the ultimate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow any steps in this guide , you should specify the ultimate but simple scene that may be very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you use it as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should be aware of this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you have no camera , no rules can be applied as a result , you will receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have any error @-@ free installed , you can see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ as@@ er ; the following pre@@ defined window fix@@ ture : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should use the menus and symbols , and even their application . &quot;
&quot; you can select all objects from the object tree . select the scene , select all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu entry . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree contains a new entry with the designation of the camera . if you click on , see the contents of the camera , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can change the camera in the view of the camera , but note that you can change the camera in the view . click on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button or the input , change the wire model page@@ views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as result they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might want to create a Qu@@ inc@@ line ( insert end body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a common method for solution this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eins ; it is actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in object tree , change the name and press the input . in object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is also the level of the plane , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you see the scene , stretch the plane until the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you can view the object tree , you will find that you can find the standard options for each new object : scal@@ able , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the lens . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the bottom to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just so that you will get some of these parameters . select the values and select the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; there are many different materials , but choose from some different materials , but choose something different from the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue in which you can choose to select how the object is inserted . please select the name of the name in the self @-@ view ( name = floor @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button , see how the pig@@ ment are now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments are only a black black material because you have to check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . enter the colors for the pig@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; if you are in the preview no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and add the preview . &quot;
the material for the floor is now correctly adjusted . if you choose your picture now using a click on the symbol you should get the following result :
&quot; this entry is only available in German , English , German , English , German , English , German , French , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , French , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , French , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , English , German , French , German , English , German , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian , Spanish , Italian . &quot;
choose the object tree ( s ) and change the colors in the view of the lens :
&quot; this step should be able to run this step , as you should understand the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ile . the ball is just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the property , you can change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input or button to press ) so that the ball is contact with the ground . otherwise it would be the ball over the ground , as you did the ground for a unit according to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course there is a strange result : as already mentioned , the ball surface is like a black black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball you can now have a material , you can now use a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select the top sub@@ menu and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click &quot; &quot; Pig@@ ment &quot; &quot; button and select the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve better effects if you take time to take some finish properties :
change the values such as in the following screen photos and click on press or press the input .
&quot; the settings of color effect and reflection matches even good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces , even if metal is not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression that allows you to create a good impression that you can create , but you have already learned that you can easily create simple , but beautiful scenes . &quot;

&quot; audio CD ; is an audio CD ; file size for &amp; k@@ de ; with him , simply audio CD ; s read and read in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the computer . &quot;
&amp; audio files is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the download of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ effici@@ ents that are supported by the Linux distribution ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of &amp; CD ; read and read in WAV files on the computer ( losses and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as low @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , that read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audiovisual media ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has not installed a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this is now done . &quot;
&quot; for example , FLA@@ C is not used for any Linux distri@@ butions . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . &quot;
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ode has a small introduction over encoding , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying from protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses the audio data from the &amp; CD ; but not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; during the set , the dialog may have to be made , but often called up to a suitable configuration , the user can be called up to an appropriate configuration . this leads to the understanding of the slender approach of user interface , using which you are often proud to be proud of this . &quot;
&quot; can convert in many formats - depending on how co@@ di@@ ode programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;

&quot; opens the file manager so that a already existing file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; cut and cut . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( such as proto@@ cols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming items ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
opens the main dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ audiovisual media ; with different cards cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . &quot;
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ gesti@@ bility and compres@@ sive rates and helps you to install the right encoding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss of free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are other similar games like &apos; sh@@ acks &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the audio formats , MP3 and O@@ GG the most common model . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage to MP3 in audio quality with low bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but via this bit rate are less important because both co@@ di@@ odes are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be delivered with most distri@@ butions free of distribution , but there are open license questions . &quot;

O@@ GG - if only music belongs to a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG players are available .
&quot; MP3 - when music also belongs to other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , disk drive , disk drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a brief list with parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should be usually possible for most people and most music pieces , and has a high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps CB@@ R , compres@@ sive rate around 5.5 . needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a Tit@@ les . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 kb@@ ps CB@@ R @-@ stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a Tit@@ les . well Gen@@ ug for music from youth , portable devices and auto@@ graph@@ o@@ plants . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ K@@ b@@ ps CB@@ R . this setting is best for most people and most environments , but if you have absolutely highest quality you want to use the best quality without attention to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information which can be entered manually or by the Free@@ DB server on the Internet is available as a list of parameters . it can be used as a list of parameters . it can be used in the program as a list of parameters .
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and this parameter . the manual or the help to the encoding for this programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key words ( English : day ) , when MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audiovisual media ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audiovisual media ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I need to be legal . however , nobody can prevent me from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it can be used without the music . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Free@@ DB , this type of configuration can be used as the system . in this type of configuration , the email address will not be used ( This cannot be checked ) . &quot;
&quot; in many countries , the main database contains the main database . if &amp; k@@ audiovisual media ; for use of Free@@ DB server , the geographical location shall be used in the network and the load between the computer . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of elements for the online call of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; you can download the complete database or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which Aus@@ les@@ heet is used to store pieces from &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there is rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , who is to know exactly that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package is to be installed in the appropriate distribution first , if this does not happen . &quot;
&quot; for saving the WAV files , the co@@ di@@ verter and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab tab , can be added to the tab tab . &quot;
the co@@ operating package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ verter is required .
&quot; after installing a code , you can receive more information about his switch by entering a command line as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ dens@@ ate windows ( cover ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can be many causes . check the institution &apos;s name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) to be installed and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check whether you don &apos;t want a copy of audio CD ; to read the instructions of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to go . &quot;

the first section covers the basic set of &amp; co@@ axial length ; something what is probably done only once done
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for every error &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here , we determine the support for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as audio format ( --@@ MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 kb@@ ps ) . &quot;
&quot; even though we can change this settings , we will not be able to read it at any time of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;

&quot; note : the computer must be connected during the download &amp; CD ; with the internet , so that he can access the Free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection field is simple , a &amp; CD ; entry will be found immediately . the directory name / file name and file name will be changed with the directory name / file name , and the ID@@ 3 tags provided with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , you can work with Free@@ DB locally in the offline mode when you are using Free@@ DB locally in the offline mode , you must be selected with Free@@ DB locally in the offline mode . &quot;

&quot; this is , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audiovisual media ; finished . this configuration will be selected as standard for any number of &amp; CD ; when you choose the organizational structure of your music , you need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , MP3 files are described as the process of a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , we will be installed as a link to the internet . &quot;
&quot; as we have a &amp; CD ; they are not included in Free@@ DB , the screen photos are a little different than that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully checked Free@@ DB data . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of using Free@@ DB data . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ maid .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD ; in the drive that defines the main window , it has been defined in the main window . &quot;
after a brief moment the pieces and their length are listed in the window will be listed as in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; be identified and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read and directed by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this is not happening , you are looking for questions and answers according to the help or go back to the basic Settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully performed by the Free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled , and also the name of the artist and the album will appear . &quot;
&quot; for the case that it is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window , and you can select the database entry to your opinion , and you can select the database entry to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross section for the automatic query by Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ Settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger the data from the first Kn@@ op@@ ing in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , you need to use the connection to the Internet . &quot;

&quot; the artist must not include any more in the input field , unless you have an application with different artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ als per unit , the comment field of the album will be used for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successfully checked the data from Free@@ DB , the CD Editor is not empty , but it contains a good idea to check the content of the CD @-@ Edi@@ tors , so that it is always a good idea to check the content of CD @-@ Edi@@ tors , but also to check whether there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of one piece , and only 28 characters for the comment@@ ator . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio settings . &quot;
you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with him you can also use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags No tags are supported by all the encoding or file formats . see the help of the code to get more information .
for more information about fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read information about the categories of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD @-@ Edi@@ tors appears again and you see that the fields of the album has already been delivered with the collected data , which we have collected for the first piece . &quot;
&quot; click the next line in the main window , click the same way to you all the title data of &amp; CD . &quot;
note : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already included in this category of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that it &apos;s a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the title will be selected , or make sure all the pieces are selected , or make sure all the pieces are selected , or make sure all the pieces are selected to select all the pieces . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button to read the selection process , this window will start to confirmation . then , we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running . &quot;
click on tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left corner of the window directly under the buttons of the workpiece .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is displayed on the disk drive in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error you can see if you are trying to work with a code that you don &apos;t have to work with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; in the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you have to access the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error is directly after the end of the first unit . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first unit , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 in the format MP3 . please note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the Program@@ mes has no configuration setting to press this behavior . the only thing which seems to be done is the result of parallel processes the result is uncle@@ ar . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not have no problem during the same time and encoding ( from however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is found , and a third order is used in the queue for a short period of the window , a little window with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoding of your choice . &quot;
&quot; most distri@@ butions are also included within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are using CV@@ S , you can download the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you have already done it already ... &quot;
this section is designed for people who are compiled by source files and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program your needs can be adapted if it is once , the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; there are many different other programs , many variations on settings . in the best case you read the step by step and settings . it shows screen photos of the different cards of the settings and includes comments for options . &quot;

&quot; what is this reads ? who is this reads , probably the program started . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author can do this manual . it &apos;s a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio quality . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then do you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ X and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ ies of &amp; k@@ de ; but besides others , it has a real @-@ time frame and kar@@ aoke , traditional music of texts as well as some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players not have . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is based on the O@@ SS system to all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support function .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the li@@ ed@@ text on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of each MIDI channel as by high@@ lighting of the ge@@ aring buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can play in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ cross or window .
it supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lift or tex@@ tures ) .
seat support . if you are &amp; k@@ de ; during the cycle of a song starts the mid @-@ next time again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ izer with A@@ we , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; firstly , you can select the select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog box , which can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also use a file from a &amp; Kon@@ cross or window ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will be created with several lights at the same time .
&quot; to play a music piece , open and open the button to play the button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry file from the menu unit or open the space button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you have been added to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces them will be added to a collection and then add each other . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as soon as soon as soon as we play , you can use it at any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the control . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song to quickly or slow down , you can change the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ display . &quot;
&quot; the space button has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the empty bar or the distance of the menu item is played in the menu . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set up what events are displayed and even better : the event type will enable you to set out a song , so that you do not need to set them manually . if you want to change the text settings , the Kar@@ aoke text will be selected automatically when you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings menu items or lights . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can be summari@@ zed .
&quot; to place an collection , open the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copy and then add the name to the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original songs . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set the winner of the collecting manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns you when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , they must add the button to add a song . there will be the file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting . &quot;
&quot; if automatic uses is enabled , a piece of opening or drag &amp; drop is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if the folder is not enabled , it is activated when opening a piece of the temporary collection is activated . this collection will then be added to the default pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , the collection and the desired song and then click on removal . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as it were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be updated . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in collecting manager or use the selection list via the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button of the song , select the next song from the menu of the menu or press the key arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the button previous piece of the menu or press the key arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select where the collection and click on the button . &quot;
&quot; temporary files may not be deleted . however , there &apos;s no role as they can be saved from &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izer which is not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thes@@ izer .
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI Map that converts all events of the type change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always a trumpet , when originally a piano play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI files , because all sound cards GM cards are compatible ( incl. A@@ we and G@@ US maps , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
there is no programs to create MIDI files . you must edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite text ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that saves all necessary conditions for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear , except the download section , which is often appear as required . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you can see that it is used to view that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of an end is reached .
&quot; please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can be compatible with future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be compatible with devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , indicated as the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like follows : &quot;
&quot; note that the left side of the par@@ ser is ignored . it is assumed that the GM file is not change in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional &quot; Key@@ s@@ To M is used to make all the sounds that need this instrument . if your keyboard does not support you ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( for example with sound 60 ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are playing a MIDI file a touch with patch 127 ( threaded Mode ) , it takes over 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; drum patch of the patch , in which each sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instruments ( drum , basin , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound height of the same drum means ( such as some Key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to give as sounds on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P period , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 items . &quot;
you can define for each channel and each instrument . you need to use several names in the first line different names .
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program .
this section can be used to form a number of channels to other channels . if you want to exchange the first and the second channel you want to exchange the first and the second channel .
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards that have created the per@@ c on a certain channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , other need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , the Key@@ line is to be used to change all events that will try to change all events that will try to change the patch on this channel . &quot;
&quot; the option of For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to be useful in order to use the per@@ malink . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is indicated in which the Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender @-@ Event is multip@@ lied by the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , and then be forwar@@ ded to the value of the formula ( r / 40@@ 96 ) . the value of 40@@ 96 is used to be used in the Map file ( r / 40@@ 96 ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM indicates that a Pit@@ ch event will be playing with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , try some Key@@ boards to play two sounds up to a oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI Map , simply open the dialogue MIDI settings . these can be found under settings , point MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a number of pi@@ anos ( one for every MIDI channel ) .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel .
the channel view ( until now ) two different views to view the selected sounds . view the menu settings below the point channel : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can be played on two different devices as well as two different musicians . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t need to force a similar sound quality . but a typical MIDI file is about 50 MB , while a mp3 file does not need a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have the control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary number ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support , you need to download a source of source and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; remove the folder , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a new listing first , you will receive a license key instantly by email that turns the jQuery Slider Free Edition into a Business one . &quot;
&quot; you can click the arrow keys to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the playback . &quot;
&quot; I have to be open in a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this work area , I have to be open a kar@@ aoke file , and I will change the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; and the desired file will be converted into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; when you want to add a file , it is possible to add a file without having to add it back to a collection . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add MIDI files to A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you only want to add the first file . &quot;
then check the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and add a collection with all three files . how do you make it ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files , or post cards . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m in the third year that I am not a lot of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , music , and phrases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you want to make a question , an error or a idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ son@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;

&quot; for more information on the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger , the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set up as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger is implemented as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; currently , just a plugin that is available for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
use of Deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project starts with the selection of a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in project settings .
if a Deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled to appear some additional elements in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view which is displayed in the content of surveillance variables .
&quot; a view , in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; a view , in which the issue ( as in HTML ) of Deb@@ ug@@ gers is usually shown in the lower Do@@ ck . &quot;
depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers is all or part of the following functionality .
&quot; with this action , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if required , or it is opened when a project is opened when a project is opened when a project is opened . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session start the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or finished the foli@@ age after requirements .
this is equal to the server to view a Deb@@ ug account . this is equal with the use of a browser to view the actual document . the output of this requirement is shown in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger will start to start with the execution of the script , and information about the monitored variables as well as the currently closed line . it happens when the script is started , the script is started with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; if this happens , the de@@ bug@@ ger will begin with the execution of the script . if this happens when a script is given , the version has been given . it happens when a de@@ bug@@ ging request is given , the execution is as soon as a request . &quot;
&quot; the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , without in the functions or include . &quot;

&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Italian language and family 2 , the script type and the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from a existing D@@ TD . see in for details . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how the XML files are created , then the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , and also works on the same . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are not as folder . they contain only the tab@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder also carry the name of graphic language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4@@ .01 @-@ window ) &quot;
&quot; table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML to and ready , whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use other users a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and borders will be laid in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain the definition of many tags , but only as only element type above itself is nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the Tag@@ type class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type method is valid only for the type of class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a only element type element .
describes a attribute attribute of a tags . this element can only be used once for each attribute . it &apos;s the name and the type of Attributes .
&quot; for example , the names of source texts for the attributes in the Day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ ment and the attribute of the attribute method &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and method name . the arguments which can be handed over to the method . can be empty or % slower name , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day the elements of a list is together . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a only element type element .
this day can be found in a dialog within a dialog box . this day can only happen in a dialog box ( e.g. once for any &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
there is the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog box ( e.g. for any &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the defined settings . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
&quot; if you want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; subject matter , &amp; quot ; and &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; quot ; and &amp; lt ; and all in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools are in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and monitor Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the review is only available at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file .
in the following an example for a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file the fil@@ en@@ ame function is described in this file .

an action can set up with settings . click on new action leads to the same dialog :
the button user defines the button keys . click the user &apos;s button can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ ening .
the simpl@@ est actions can be entered in the detector settings and in execution of the action is inserted in the document at the current cue position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of these action you can change external applications ( normally script , but it is not limited ) that document the document or use ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start -@@ dialog or the various attempts in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
you can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window .
&quot; it is highly qualified , it is recommended to use the % script@@ ac@@ tional file in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh@@ .@@ This way tries to find the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / keywords : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / keywords : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / keywords : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / keywords : &quot;
&quot; % f : we have been replaced with the URL of the current document , in case of a local document file : / from the documentation name . &quot;
&quot; PID : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is used in the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameter for this event , normally the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be set out of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the selection field it can be determined to send the default input . options : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % VAT is normally only with this setting .
&quot; in accordance with the input , there are two types : normal output , on the standard edition . it can be indicated with the default output output , which is indicated by the default output output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Polish language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to share the tags in logical groups . in the case it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool has been added , you need to add the actions and configure your actions . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action Kn@@ op@@ ard at the lower end of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate work@@ station .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag attributes , and you are planning your use , activate dialog &quot; Tag &quot; when available , so that an input in action is possible . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 4@@ 44 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; for creating a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ d ; select from &amp; quot ; , graphic other programs ( or where else there is in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to know what the action is , but also all other users of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day , I decided to create a start button as symbol . thanks to the use of green ( green is usually considered as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user , or should at least , a message to the user . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of symbol , it must be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings . ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is , choose it and confirm you with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button and put them with other tags , so that there is , or confirm you to close with OK . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions for the tool@@ bar , or it should be distributed to a better overview of several adverti@@ sers in several groups . &quot;
I would like to choose the separation ( all left ) for my work@@ station . after selecting the element it should be added to the tool@@ bar to the tool@@ bar . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I would like to add a quick opportunity to access the Kon@@ cross or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
&quot; please note , how the Tren@@ ner will support group support . someone who doesn &apos;t know my work does not know that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ Kn@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar needs to be tested through all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; if you do not exist in the correct folder , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your work@@ station should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
perhaps the chosen version of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or form@@ atting language that you like to give as a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , whether someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create a existing documentation for form@@ alities / script / etc ; language . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something : &quot;

notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; note that the contents are stored directly on a file , ( and consistent use at the top end of the construction site &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will appear ! ) . &quot;
&quot; empty spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ files may be replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array _ array is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file extensions are displayed . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of synchron@@ ous context elements which are available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
you can easily convert your file doc@@ r@@ c to store and save $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / mehr or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / / or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc / or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc / doc / file for local or global use . then create a folder ( so how to use this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder like doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth , please send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for the use
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you &apos;re not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; using email to friends , partners or otherwise , if you are sent to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places you can send a message with email , as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , the tool@@ bar works with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the script . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the event you will be sent to your Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be stored ) , or in the case that you have to be looking for several keys , you can also be looking for a dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the high@@ ways can upload from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before the installation , they examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to convert XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is supported by a D@@ TE@@ P package . there is the simpler way to convert a D@@ TD files into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD on and Convert a D@@ TD command . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which will be used for the following dialog :

fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after the conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area in three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ections . this distinction is a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
local items represent a personal collection of Web@@ development for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific patterns and work@@ stations . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; this can be done within a certain project . this can be done within a certain project . this can be done within a certain project , this is the most limited size . all elements are specifically designed for the files of a specific project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the builders , with information and the tool@@ bar . please let you in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; using the right mouse button , click on the right click to receive a context menu with the current document , or delete the document , delete or end of the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; in the editing area , the editor will lead to a further context menu for a further context menu , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy ) , processing of the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string is referred to under the mouse cursor a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editing window , the tool@@ bar of the Edi@@ tors are displayed . &quot;
&quot; the use of work@@ stations is really easy . if they want to add a tag , then click the symbol that you want to add several attributes ( like the anchor ) , you may want to fill out the information for this straight day ( like the anchor ) . &quot;
&quot; the construction sites ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to open the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate to open it , and to be able to open it , in the presentation with cardboard boxes , scripts , scripts , attributes , attributes and documentation elements available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows the use of files in the project using a right mouse click . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how they used it . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ working area . global templates are always available , local templates can only be used for the relevant users and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of recording in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works here . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by links to an elementary document , the cursor is placed on the position of the element . by law @-@ clicking on a list , it opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and duration of the building . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction sites . with him , we can change the attributes of all available attributes of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it can download the documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create own documentation and can be edited by adding a folder on a project . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cardboard cut@@ ters at the bottom end of the window , can be accomplished through the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this cart@@ els shows information about each in Qu@@ anta &apos;s script . so , e.g. the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus for work@@ stations are more extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .

the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it offers a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; it can be retri@@ eved using the source editor .
&quot; when works with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , it is not possible to change this directly with the V@@ PL . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just as the first one , except that at the same time the changes in the source text editor , and the cursor is activated in the source text editor . &quot;

it is possible to mount a external CSS style template by using the file button and select the corresponding file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is like in a text processing , due to rare circumstances , the marking works as usual . &quot;
&quot; the entry of tags will not be removed in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is possible to note that the insertion of tags have been inserted in the same way , e.g. when an anchor day , is inserted with text , must be removed with text . &quot;
several work@@ stations like the tables assistant or lists of lists are disabled . they will work later in the V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used in this release or lists work@@ stations .

there are many graphic tools to find it . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; let me explain me why I have written .
&quot; the meeting was very complicated because one of the number of changes were done and at the same time , a further programmers had been changed into the same file . &quot;
&quot; this changes was changed by me , I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines . and there were no information on the places where perhaps the changes were changed . &quot;
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; was differences within a line and changes to white characters . later each amount of further useful functions have been added .
&quot; if you want to compare it quickly , copy it into the intermediate frame and add it into a comparison . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the weight and mer@@ ging of stat@@ utes . this function returns &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully automated file browser .
&quot; this is useful if two people are working independently of one piece of co@@ de work and changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps to edit the correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result of the correct changes . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you to create and create a complete folder . this screen shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when using the folder name :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences of different color monitors . if you do frequently need to check this function .
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines are displayed only in a certain number of white characters , one can see a look at the summary of the column on the left @-@ hand side . ( no anger more if you change the return . ) &quot;
&quot; red color means that both files are different . red color means that both files differ .
&quot; if all files are using the same name , but in various folders , you can make the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ b@@ eit easily by using the file name of the first file . &quot;
you can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window .
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual input of file names , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or the distance of a last updated file , the analysis of the differences are carried out by two files . &quot;
&quot; if you choose a folder , you can select a folder . if you choose a folder , you will select a folder , then use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is not necessarily required to update the input and can be used immediately . it is not necessarily required , immediately to save a output file . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set the options before you start using the product .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
you can also use Zi@@ p and paste it : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let him fall on a comparative window .
&quot; if you want to figure out these functions , it would be a relatively large effort . you may need to create two relevant files , it would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
note : there are currently no translation from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is also supported by text in a comparative window .
warning : some editors interpret the numer@@ als and put text in another program as a cut and insert ( instead of copy and paste ) in such a case you could lost your original data .
&quot; the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional ) . &quot;
&quot; the letters A , B and C . A has the colour blue , B and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one sees the color of the color . if both files differ , it is very useful if you compare three files . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color sch@@ ema is particularly useful if you are three files . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages , the column shows the appropriate colour . if differences in white characters are not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes .

&quot; vertical line , which separates the co @-@ column from the text , will be interrupted at the places where the respective source file is not enabled . if the line is enabled , the line will be shown at the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison list ) also has a info line with the wording issue : , the file name and &#91; the changes &#93; . usually it contains the automatic exchange of text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;

&quot; if only two comparison is used , every difference at the same time it must be solved too . &quot;
this group will be marked with the left mouse button in one of the windows and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed as the beginning of the group .
sometimes there is no further line in the source or by manual editing any further line of the text will be displayed in the source file and maybe a different source . this text will be displayed in the final saved file still in a marking that you might want to copy and paste it in different lines .

&quot; in Au@@ c@@ ef@@ en@@ ster , you can also use the other buttons to use the other buttons . &quot;
click on the left mouse button and select the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in section code and the edi@@ table output file was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with the current / first / last difference in the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g from above ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g from above ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@

&quot; select a scrip@@ ture with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also provides fonts with variable width to selecting , you should not use this but not . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , the differences in ital@@ ici@@ an scrip@@ ture can not be supported . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be presented to the button settings automatically . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , you will be inserted the corresponding number of empty lines . otherwise a tab@@ ular characters is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press , return or return , will automatically be used for the next line automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection will be copied to the cli@@ pboard . the manual copy into the cli@@ pboard is not required . &quot;
you can select which type type you prefer to save which type type you prefer . the pre @-@ defined value is the common use on the operating system .
&quot; when you are using files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines are ignored in the source files . the second step is ignored every line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a Wag@@ en@@ ame &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other in turn left &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , figures and characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
changes in comments are disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
&quot; the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ echan@@ ika mode , this setting is how long the result of selecting selection is displayed before the next stage of the project will continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if white signs are used in white signs by the chosen file . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful if white signs are less important . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful if white signs are less important . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful if white signs in many files are less important . if you use this only time to time , then use the Automatic selection in numbers or comments , if the options must ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments . &quot;
this options will be treated in the chapter for scanning and lead to a meeting . watch for details under documentation to directory comparison and guidance according to the list .
&quot; when a file is saved and already a older version , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix file , then the original version is available with Su@@ ff@@ ix file , this can be deleted without further backup . &quot;
this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is closed from the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you use this option to use this option is used for all entries the upper setting .
&quot; on the selection fields for the encoding , a short note that the local encoding is a short note that the local code is not changed , and has a purely inform@@ ational character . ) &quot;
adjust the file encoding for source files . this is influenced by special characters and interpret the encoding for each file can be compared with different encoding .
&quot; if you have a file , you can specify which encoding can be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ command commands , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. may your files 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the transfer command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ CII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output commands . &quot;
this applies to changes in numbers or comments . ( note : this applies also for changes in numbers or comments if the options must ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available , if you want to compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded column . but sometimes you would like to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes I want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . shoot the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
returns the comparison to each other or another one . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and decide to perform the files of the last source file and use the file name of the last source file as pre@@ defined name for the output file . ( if this function is used to run the command line then the name of the last used output file . )
&quot; after reading a file , it is visible to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . &quot;
&quot; after reading a file , it has been delivered to this external command ( see above ) , then the input of the command commands ( see above ) , then the output of this command is only used when the command line is equal to each input line . each input line must have an additional output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind this is , the user needs more flexibility when entering the Di@@ ff results . &quot;
use this evaluation command to convert the input into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
some key words are automatically generated automatically ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word ) . all follow the same sample text . you can change the list of required passwords . you can change the list of required format : the \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \
they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ig@@ nor@@ ate of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 .
&quot; sometimes you would like to perform several cards at once . then , you may use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; &quot; to be separated to separate each one . example : &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor for the ad and to merge . the other operations can change the data that sees the tick @-@ off Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the metric pre@@ processor pre@@ processor the output of the normal pre@@ processor pre@@ processor . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences , you may destroy certain differences and in the worst case of important dates . &quot;
often need to edit the files into a folder of files .
... makes a proposal for each object . you can adjust the proposal before the start .
... can be simulated and shows the simulated changes without they really carry out
... leads to selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is very similar to you . you must be able to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if there are three folders , folder 1 as a base . if any target folder , uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts to start working , you need to select the appropriate menu items or the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window across the current progress . if you select the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed up until then compared to the folder . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning is completed , it shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side ... &quot;
each file and each folder will be found in a tree . you can select one object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is normally folded together . you can use a folder on the + / - click , or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two features all sub @-@ directories and all sub @-@ directories . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file , the file comparison started and it appears a comparison . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; when the file type is visible in the other folder , this is visible in the old A / B / C and in the detailed windows to the selected object . &quot;
&quot; as in the above picture it is used in the old A / B / C colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; you can also use Add images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to folder ... &quot;
&quot; the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow will then be yellow and later , when it is old , red will be red . &quot;
... A and C identical are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists ) &quot;
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if there exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if there exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types are not started . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types are not started .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit document folders , and when the option is synchron@@ ised . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : together and perform the result in both folders and select the result in both folders and select the results in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output files only B ; B to A. )
&quot; when the files are recorded and the option is enabled , then the date of files and hits the newer file will be activated . if the files are different , but the date of files are not removed , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; while the process will lead a file after the other . they have been successful , and according to other messages if something changed , you should take a last check and see if the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if the dialog dialog is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will be selected . these include the number of people , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts will only appear if three folders must be compared or together . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either perform the right entry ( file or file ) , or all entries based on once . if you have selected any function actions ( even in all sub @-@ folders ) , you can start working together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you are not allowed to use a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , then will be selected as a goal and to synchron@@ ize B and / or B as goal . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are displayed on the target folder , even in the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; to bring all entries , select the directory directory / continue the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard ) . &quot;
&quot; if due to contradic@@ tory file types , invalid combination will be published on the error elements . you can choose to select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you run all entries , a dialog box will lead to the options , Sim@@ ulate and Ab@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to see what would happen , without the really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; if you are ready to run a file , select &lt; directory directory / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not stored , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that make the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; in case of a few items , these items are not stored in the current session ) and leads to all entries ( in current session ) and leads to all entries . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 @-@ up ... ) now has a section called directory name with these options :
&quot; only files that are displayed on the specified patterns are displayed in the element tree , it can be displayed several patterns . separated with a sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder must not match this pattern . &quot;
&quot; files and folders are displayed on this pattern , not included in the element tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; files and folders are displayed on this pattern , not included in the element tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S , the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) . &quot;
&quot; in some file systems , files are marked in some file systems . in other file systems , a previous point is marked as hidden . this option you can decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is displayed in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to the links . &quot;
&quot; with links to folder : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is switched on , the links will lead to a link that contains links like normal folders . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders about a slower network , it may be quicker , only the change of date and file size . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be useful if it is still large . the files are used as identical when they are equal . &quot;
&quot; using the sync mode when two folder will be compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals will be stored in this mode , and the results are stored in both folders and are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this will be the knowledge that the other file doesn &apos;t change it . you should check this in any case . ) This option is available in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when a file or folder will be ren@@ amed , the original version is named and receives the extension .@@ original . if a old Backup file has already been deleted , this is not only the process of individual files , not only the existence of individual files . this option is on the default setting . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder are visible to individual files . if you don &apos;t want to move the window panel with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window window , you can switch the window menu in the window menu and by changing between the directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to compare it to double @-@ click it . however , you can also run a single file . &quot;

K@@ DE supports network transparent with help of Ki@@ o @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to use files and folders .
&quot; the first command line is a local file with an FTP server . the second command line , a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder . &quot;
&quot; a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should be aware : &quot;
&quot; a path can be relatively . or .. this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations : &quot;

&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources , and the default script does not find the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the same setting , K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
please re@@ type the code from the graphics into the text field
the editor can be saved for every difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this is necessary to design a conflict simply by clicking on the source text file and it is too much effort to design this information .
the effort has been so big . you can recover a certain version ever by using a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used to be another editor .
&quot; after remove text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ eup ; appeared , and the text can &apos;t delete it . what means that and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to raise the differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . use the other editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;

&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click on the same position as soon as the mouse cursor is on the same place . it is thought to help people who is on the RS@@ I syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , as the mouse cursor is a while at the same place , it is thought to help people who want to re@@ lie@@ ve the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , it can be caused by pain using the mouse , and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can look at pain using the use of your computer . if this is not yet done , you should look for a doctor if this is not done . &quot;
&quot; to avoid it , even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid pain using the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the cause of the mouse , the result can be used for any different forms . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , is simply : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; due to your mouse movements and leads a mouse click , as soon as you get the movement short . &quot;
&quot; the smart force is activated , making it a pause , after that the right mouse button has been executed . the smart force requires a little exercise , but you will get it quickly . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the mouse movement , it must be cut out after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if the mouse click the mouse button , the rotation speed ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ ter@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will be started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound delay will be released , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , select sound system and click the Reiter &apos;s sound . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , will start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; the function is only under &amp; k@@ de ; the function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments . &quot;
sets all settings to the values that were set up when opening the dialogue .
&quot; at the best you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the pre @-@ settings . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in brackets . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : the clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window which does not display the link to such places . you can therefore use the mouse to such places until you want to use them . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse should be clean , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not use the mouse button , but also the roles that come with the mouse button in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take the mouse position . like this happens , is from mouse to mouse . it should be fast clear if you see the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;ll need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the ball was used . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system is the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use an intelligent process , it means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation does not stop the right mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under a different window manager and a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can use a mouse click . therefore , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be set back and you can continue to work as well . &quot;
problem : if you are looking for text editor tries to run &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue your cursor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor , where you want to place the cursor on a neutral area of the work@@ space , if you don &apos;t want to lead the mouse over a neutral area of work . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent control , but I don &apos;t work , so that text can be edi@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent push is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you want to copy it into the cli@@ pboard , or to add any other action , if you want to move it into the cli@@ pboard or any other action you want to move it . here are some advice : &quot;
use the smart force does not use the smart force if you only start to start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead of the mouse click on the mouse button while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and click the mouse button again .
&quot; you can use the hearing mouse click . thus , you can use a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be installed on the most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers .
this program was developed for people who are developing on the RS@@ I syndrome .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time that takes a certain time before the mouse is left . this way can also be done by mouse and place with the mouse .

&quot; warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; cover ; processor will be closed , and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning . &quot;
&quot; there is an example for an application that uses news . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can be used for a long text on a website , you can read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome , who are just the room . &quot;
the rest are simple text entries .
&quot; all four types of orders are listed in maintenance @-@ long , except for the output of screen reproduction . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filter never be applied on the output of screen mode . you will apply to normal warnings , news and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; - News . &quot;
&quot; filter by tag : &quot; &quot; reverse &quot; &quot; listing of statements referring to this item in object position . &quot;
&quot; in the future , there is still more kinds of filters . &quot;
&quot; when using text messages , you can either set either words or as a regular expressions . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Exec@@ ution a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; and some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the scope of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML file .
&quot; for example , you can send orders dependent on the contents of the text or depending on the program that can be sent to a speaker . if you can read the text on the map card , you can read text by K@@ DE @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a voice output . &quot;
&quot; if a text is sent , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; the processing of the filter is placed on the page below . the processing of the filter is done in the list of the list below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the most common filters . it is not enabled , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are supported by the series according to the above below . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed below the following designs di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; this text will be found in the text , then the text against the related replacement parts will be exchanged for comparison to the related replacement parts . &quot;
&quot; for your filter a name , you can select one of these names , it must be able to differenti@@ ate from the name of other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can save a list of words or regular expressions from a file that can save your list or delete it . download a list of a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if you want to select an language , the filter is only used when the speaker for the text is a registered languages . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can select several languages , when you select a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , the filter is only used when the text by one of the given applications . &quot;
for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application for q@@ d@@ bus ; the application @-@ ID copic 34@@ 32 shows you may only be able to enter .
&quot; the filter element filter will only apply to the text when all conditions are applied with a result in the box of the filter . if all the conditions are empty , the filter will be applied on all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character analysis of regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ \ The words must be limited to both sides ( empty words ) both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no guide to writing this manual . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can be installed , you can set it in the di@@ alogues or edit # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
x@@ SL@@ T files generated by X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such forming . it can only be installed on a well shaped XML . the most strong x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . when x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c via the environment variable PAT@@ H is also available in x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; you can send text on a certain speaker , which is set on the map card speaker , or an speaker with specific properties . you can set the sample of K@@ mail from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; quot ; a text to the filter is accepted , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker will be selected with the speaker features which gives the text to &amp; quot ; and to send the properties of the card filter , you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the filter , the filter is applied , if the Text contains the regular expression . it is based on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can access this with a click on the button to get help at input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to select the regular expression at the beginning of the string . &quot;
&quot; here the characteristics of the filter conditions are fulfilled , the speaker will be selected , the speaker will be chosen to view the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialogue session . &quot;
use these buttons to store your default settings or delete all settings .
&quot; for example , if all conditions apply to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box of the filter box , you must apply at least one condition . &quot;

&quot; routeRAN@@ K is a W3@@ C standard in order to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , speaking speed , the volume of the voice and the sound height . &quot;
now supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default voice to be used in the output of SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound position in the Festival configuration dialog is not shown on 100@@ ml ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very monot@@ on . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and Stat@@ utes filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the first start of &amp; quot ; is set up for the first start of &amp; kt@@ own , you can change the settings or any other visual filters . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to try and check it through a try . check out the voucher code , change some features and check out how the choice of speaking is changed , otherwise you have to be set more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; due to these reasons , the normal Stat@@ utes filter will be set automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr to the first time . it cannot be removed only . change nothing in this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the folder ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the Stat@@ ements ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) . note that the default limit filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter will be automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default Stat@@ ements filter is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the administration of network interface and DNS settings are possible . &quot;
&quot; contro@@ l@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables the user to manage a number of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ pres@@ ets via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu with contro@@ l@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file was developed to enable the users the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file for the following tasks :
&quot; after installing the installation , a new module network settings will be displayed as well . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file ) can be started by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file does not install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file is enabled . &quot;
&quot; in most cases the driver for network hardware and other devices can be added to install &amp; Linux ; with installed and set @-@ up . &quot; network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the core version : &quot;
the module network settings will be loaded when the option network settings will be selected . when Star@@ ts of the module network settings are trying to recognize the platform system automatically .
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the platform is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings is possible only in the system administrator mode . previously all the options are gray , which means to change the settings , change the settings in the right side of the module . it is the input of passwords . &quot;
&quot; in the system setting mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the network interface allows for management of network devices of network devices . all available network devices are displayed .
the settings are indicated by selecting your desired device in the list and click on the buttons in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Kn@@ op@@ ard Settings dialog shows the dialogue with further possibilities . &quot;
the TCP / IP settings are stored on a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP servers .
&quot; if you want to install the TCP / IP address , the TCP / IP address must be made on the TCP / IP address . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the system interface at Bo@@ oten . if the initi@@ alization cannot be enabled , this option should not be activated . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog , the values are displayed as the properties of the device in the device . &quot;
it should be ensured that the IP address should not be used in network . the input of a already existing IP address would be used to a TCP / IP conflict .
&quot; network devices can be activated , depending on need or be switched off or switched off . turn a fully @-@ enabled network device , you will enable you to activate it from the list and click on interface .... &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off by selecting the list and click on interface to you by selecting the list and click on interface .
&quot; the IP address of the computer is set up in local sub@@ net , which uses the physical link to a remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computer . &quot;
&quot; if your computer is available as a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer has been selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers are only IP addresses .
&quot; you can also be added to the nam@@ espace part of this list . entries can be added , or changed or changed .@@ DNS items can be added to the list with the buttons on or off in the priority . &quot;
you can add a DNS server from the group computer to add a DNS server . it is indicated by the dialog of the name server name .
&quot; first , you need to add the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group , select one entry and click on the button ... It will appear on the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list of all well known computer systems describes the name of the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for the TCP / IP sub system . it is used primarily for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally it contains the list of particularly well known computers , the &amp; AP@@ OS ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses can be used in the test version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click on adding .... The dialogue of the Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; to select the name of the known computer , and the button click here . if the known machine has several Ali@@ as names , de button and select the other Ali@@ as names . &quot;
select one entry to another well known computer from the list and select Delete Open .... The dialog box will appear .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then click OK , the list of static Ho@@ sts is updated . &quot;
&quot; in the module network settings , not immediately available in the system . in order to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; for installation of binary distribution ( mostly rpm packages ) , when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
&quot; the installation of finished version is compiled for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm and install in a &amp; console : with rpm , as follows : &quot;
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ any or the installation tool of their distribution .
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but also the development of the libraries is required . &quot;
this will only be recommended to experienced users . it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf .
&quot; in the first section of this chapter will be important information on basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modified configuration files . &quot;
this section can not replace any knowledge about IP networks . in this Appendix only basic information on the integration of PCs are listed in a small ( home - ) network .
IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never expected great spread .
one of the most important information is aware of the IP address of network interface .
&quot; if the IP address should be selected , the IP address should be selected for this purpose . the addresses from the table below will not be forwar@@ ded with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting up a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
&quot; for smaller networks , the addresses are mostly used in the field of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net mask is usually installed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers have the same sub @-@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things reserved , 0.0@@ 1 ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that requires the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot;
the network address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
this file will be dynamically altered at DSL connections so that it is not surprised if the case of active DSL connections have another content as defined there .
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is set by the script in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected . &quot;

&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the status bar , the symbol is integrated into the status bar to view that the band is embedded in the status bar . in the status bar the content of the ban@@ ker can now be set up for the tape . &quot;
&quot; in front of the ban@@ ker , the integration process must first be solved . there are three methods to do this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of symbol for the band , that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message . the band can now be disc@@ arded without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it can be used by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; this procedure corresponds to the form@@ atting of &amp; k@@ dat . this process corresponds to the form@@ atting of &amp; k@@ dat , this procedure can be done before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ ulate of the ban@@ al of the ban@@ ana . all data on the band are lost automatically , and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you select the backup process , you need to select the backup file . &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree .
select a backup profile in the tree . it is included in the profile indicated in the profile .
mark files on local file tree with a hem@@ isph@@ ere . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured .
click on the right mouse button on the local file tree and select it in the menu .
&quot; once the backup has been removed , the dialog settings has been assigned to the dialog settings . in this dialog you can check the selected files and the settings for securing the backup . &quot;
the dialogue shows the dialogue . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the entry for the drive . it will only be tested only the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the Archive for the band with a hem@@ isph@@ ere . it will only be tested only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click on the right mouse button in one of the Archive and select the menu items ....
&quot; once the test procedure was started , the dialog settings has been started in the dialog settings . in this dialog you can check your selection and the working folders for check @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; if you have the settings for checking the review , the dialogue shows the dialogue . this dialog shows the progress of the examination of examination and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the re@@ load , the files must be restored to be restored . this can be done to two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the Archive which belong to the band for the band . it is only selected only the selected file or the sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the Archive with a hem@@ isph@@ ere . it will only be restored so selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click on a file or folder to a file or folders in one of the Archive and select the menu on the menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process started , the dialog settings has been started , the dialog settings for restore . in this dialog you can check your selection and the working folders for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when using the settings for recovery , the dialogue shows the dialogue . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to create the band file using the band@@ ry . this process can delete all existing documents for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
this allows a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can change the following settings :
the current working folders must be updated automatically . the list of the files will be updated according to the relevant work folder .
&quot; for all the folder that are listed under backup files , you can register in the same file system as the folder , you can register separately under backup files . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files are changed since the last inc@@ mental backup file , a sn@@ app@@ end file is not used , it will be changed files that has changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that uses the changes to changes since the last modification has been used .
del@@ etes the sn@@ app@@ end file before the call of tar . this causes that all files are secured and a new sn@@ app@@ end file for the next backup will be created .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
the settings can be configured via the menu item K@@ D@@ at setup ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be used :
the complete path to the device ( normally / dev / b ) . this path is to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the band@@ device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band will be embedded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; it is the option , tries to lock and k@@ dat . it does not work with all band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , when the integration of &amp; k@@ dat the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the tape do not use the tape . use this option not by flo@@ ppy disk . &quot;
&quot; it is the option , tried &amp; k@@ dat . not all drives support block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must do &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band , write a file on the beginning of the band . this file should only be a memory block on the band . the content of the file is as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n bytes ) The band ID . the format of this drawing sequence is the name of the system , where the name of the system is bound to the band . seconds is the number of seconds which has been approved since the period of time . &quot;
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ Archive , which should be directly connected with &amp; GNU ; - tar versions should work , as long as it is not as long as it does not work . &quot;

&quot; &amp; system log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; the program is for un@@ experienced users , you can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system can occur via your system or where the system can occur in the fast access to information about problems that occur on their servers . &quot;
&amp; system log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ systematic log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol of your own system . the program is for un@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system .
&quot; in addition , the system log @-@ log ; experienced users the fast access to information about problems that occur on their servers . &amp; system log ; therefore , some extended functions are filtered to be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a series of useful functions , among other things include : &quot;
support for many different types of protocol files for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in the further chapter of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , it is easy to filter and sorting the individual protocol of a protocol as well as sorting . the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries to open &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll , so you have to open a small news window , so you have not created a small news window , so you have not normally open a system / var / log , for the normal users normally not normally open to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion , to filter by a selected criterion . &quot;
&quot; you can select a different entry into this place . select the string of the filter search , select the column process , and carry out the name of a process in accordance with the selected column . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines as protocol @-@ lines of the level . the coloured display of protocol can be switched off with a striking colour as protocol .
&quot; in this case , you can only be useful if you would like to examine the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful if you use the output of a certain command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can also activate the option to view the new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new built protocol . &quot;
&amp; system log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ window .

&quot; the V in@@ it develops quickly to the control of the program &apos;s system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , performance and at the same time it is easier to use powerful and at the same time as the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not be further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know what I know about it , - ) . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . it is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to make a machine on system V in@@ it , without a new installation and new form@@ atted . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also distingu@@ ishes the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . in principle you need a script for each system service that you want to start at the high level of system . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; gt ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services contain not such things like set@@ serial , that only once started . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be in turn under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have these file , even if you do not want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
select the language in which this site should be shown
the default link is in / etc / in@@ en@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
&quot; in this point you can throw a view into the second column , and probably likely that the pre @-@ selected plane is 3 . if you would like to change the run 3 . if you would like to do this , then you will repair it by using the system and following the following : &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder no correct files are found . instead , every entry is displayed on one of the script in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the script is so written , that there is a argument as start and stop . &quot;
&quot; it reads the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes the argument , the script will be called the argument with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to create a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have a server error , the only htt@@ pd , &amp; quot ; , network &amp; etc ; &quot;
here you can learn the usage of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be difficult because the program is as easy as possible .
use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time .
&quot; you can change scripts from Run@@ time to move , or change the position within one levels . this happens only if it is possible to pull a different run@@ time ( or its position ) . this happens only if they are out of the available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : if you want to copy this in a new area . to copy them out this in a new section , you need to copy them out of the menu or from the menu menu and in the target area . even if the same result already exists before the target range . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of entry can sometimes be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers before you can try to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there are no possibility to publish your entries , which were thrown into the paper box . be careful . &quot;
