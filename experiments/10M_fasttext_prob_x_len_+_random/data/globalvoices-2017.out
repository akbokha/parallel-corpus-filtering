&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once per year , I would have to live for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting .
my love to America is extremely large .
&quot; how many of my generation have been brought up to American music , I have read the American music , American authors read and its sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country has a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 years old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less reporter , who were arrested by Julia Roberts . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; if you would like to be reminded by SMS , if Won@@ ita is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US only . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have lived , whose diversity so that you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of simultaneous people . &quot;
I had even a very dirty love of love about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ ity and the rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his retirement age . &quot;
&quot; he holds with his opinion on the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says what he thinks , as a former col@@ t , and explains his word for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ pol and women . &quot;
nevertheless the people have re@@ acts to his statements and in shame for him .
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won by the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that ever reached one of the party &apos;s rated candidate ever . &quot;
I was a language .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this firm person , asked me ? &quot;
&quot; I could bring Tr@@ ump and his voters , not with the people , which I learned during my time in Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ esia , Director of the journalist hom@@ icide , the people from all over the world , a deep gl@@ amor@@ ous man , with whom I could enter@@ tain me about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; , &quot; the present editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met us with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; at the game .

&quot; then Andrew Jordan , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot of my career . &quot;
these people and these are deep@@ ened by the per@@ taining values of my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump his path to the pro@@ clam@@ ation of his way to the pro@@ clam@@ ation of the Republi@@ can presidential election , they gave me a stop and the counter@@ part in his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidential election of a man , despite or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people have agreed that people for Tr@@ ump , because they were ready for their rac@@ ism and Fan@@ ati@@ sm , or because they were ready to over@@ take these things . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the man said to him , &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
this is the end and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and thinking .
it shows the people that their worry and fears over the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters have agreed to have a country , because they want to gain control over a country because they would like to gain control over a country ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe perhaps .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ ember@@ ing that the cru@@ el decision will come back to those who look back to those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ des of the White House ) : so much as &quot; re@@ alities of the White against all other societies &quot; ; words of white in the play of the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , what so much does the great Van Jones made exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background is always welcome , America is definitely welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country , as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he says , nowhere else is possible in the world . &quot;
&quot; there is a huge part of the white country , however , is a huge part of the white American Americans , and says : &quot; &quot; Hell with versatility , religious freedom and the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back again at the rest of the day . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldiers who had fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the front of the election . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hu@@ g@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; said Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the quantity answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they say , and their voices have been lou@@ dly . &quot;
&quot; if anyone else is not as you , a place in your America ? &quot;

&quot; Mr. Khan began with the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , it is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was accepted . &quot;
&quot; the land , for his son , was sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ ash country , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could no place no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

a music school with 100 students is also known for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church which is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os is known for their drugs misuse and the mess@@ enger violence .
&quot; however , this led to a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project , and the youth as well as a rare musical project . &quot;
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press is not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;

&quot; in West Africa , the ship was already known that this ship was already established in liberal waters , before it was given the other coast of Africa . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , Mauritius , Mauritius , the Com@@ ors , Mos@@ on and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles , refused to share a fishing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that you simply put everything . &quot; , &quot; Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a conduc@@ tion of the ken@@ ese fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship from the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was removed from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was compelled to pay 2 million dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) . &quot;
the members of this network are next to Britain and Madagascar to the six countries that were distributed from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , we have eight countries that are inter@@ changeable and work together . they exchange information from and stand to each other in where there are illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the PE@@ W Char@@ gers Project . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
July August September October November December
&quot; due to the ab@@ duction of existing laws , using certain living rooms and species can be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can have a del@@ usion balance . &quot;
&quot; however , during the actions against illegal fishing by bureauc@@ ratic hur@@ dles , and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions can be printed on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the individual countries can exchange universities of each other in which lists of existing activities or details that can be seen during a port . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i are the activities of ships too very atten@@ tive if this is moving on the open lake , by satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to describe ships , ships in the regions of Europe . also , let us discover that a ship will point to a ship to make a ship a ship on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such examinations can show , whether the ships have a fish b@@ gli@@ z@@ enz where they were on the way , and possibly whether they have a Stra@@ vin@@ gi@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; that means that the ships will not sell their load on the basis of such ships in their hem@@ isph@@ ere . what means that the ships will not sell their charge , and that they will be forced to sell their charge . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a significant financial losses for the owner , what means that the illegal fishing is no longer worth more worth . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to reach &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ lac company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed Front
&quot; the already existing platform was created to win the estimated 20 million dollars on lost sales , the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i would lose its year because of illegal fishermen , which penet@@ rate in eastern African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive @-@ t@@ una fisher@@ man , why the region is commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , such actions are the same as the sailing flag as the sailing flag , made by Ph@@ armacy , the fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you are taking advantage of the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; before a ship was illegal and a country could say &apos; You could not run my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ged hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
this is the closed front .
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it has been discovered that it has been discovered in Tanzania . it has discovered that ships that have multiple dec@@ eption of identi@@ ties and has found w@@ ret@@ ched ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities to fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about great distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organic crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that allows F@@ ISH @-@ i help to make sure ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly being developed and helps to hide the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ land , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat tracking , a N@@ RO that also offers fishing information and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example , for example their automatic identification systems , which they cannot be set out of satellite channels . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels of each other .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African countries actually influence the global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ virus , believe that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ lines has been opened with Google and the marine protection organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana the platform for Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and using the location of each individual ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; with the neighb@@ ors to get a better image of it , he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and strengthen their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; PE@@ W Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run a global system the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminals , but also ab@@ sent them . &quot;
ships that were used without license fees and hardly any consequences we know that they will be observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have seen a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats are more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i , Gre@@ ko said , Gre@@ ko 1 opened up , and found the insp@@ ectors there on board network , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission from F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is very strong that us also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study period . &quot; &quot; in West Africa appear several hundred millions dollars by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are six countries together on the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ winning &quot; &quot; With Security , the goal , even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ land . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member country in October was a ship in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the front of the land . and not only was the ship too without license and were tow@@ ed networks . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also reserved for fish@@ eries , which are reserved for fishermen from Britain . &quot; &quot; with the support of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong sign that they go against illegal fish . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such special , collaborative collaboration to protect the oc@@ eans actually works in London . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the topic , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red magazines , TE@@ D Education , New York Times and Guardian . &quot;
&quot; in Venezuela , the road movements in Venezuela seem to be able to be able to be the beginning of a wave of police . &quot;
it is considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

particularly large waves sm@@ ote the message over police suppression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators gathered in the local Cathedral to protect itself according to their own statement before the police and armed forces to protect the government .
&quot; in hours later they could leave the cathedral again again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police force , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira are not suitable for women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , because you could not see what many of the gar@@ dian do not have ! &quot;

this is the dictatorship of the country .
many representatives of the government had the validity of the demand for an office in question - this has been proven in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of the presence of countless men on the street .

&quot; as he was 15 years old , Luis Alber@@ to Qui@@ j@@ ano from his father was compelled to look at La Per@@ la , one secret prison in the city of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;

&quot; as his father began to carry out the same name as his father to carry to the brutal military ro@@ per@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he did in the age of 15 years . &quot;
&quot; 34 years long , he kept the family secret for himself . &quot;
&quot; in the situation , I believed that the order was in order . &quot;
I felt like a mystery .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t want to manipul@@ ate from his father . &quot;
&quot; of course , I couldn &apos;t see that my father was a di@@ eb , folklore and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alber@@ to Qui@@ j@@ ano , was his father from 1976 to 1978 , his father from 1976 to 1978 . he was his father from 1976 to 1978 . he was his father from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
&quot; during the first time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; as he took me the second time , he commanded me to go to the cars , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators , just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little in a blanket , and commanded me to wear it to wear . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ash of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day I went to the other end of the barriers , where the stolen objects were set and under@@ gone me with a wax . &quot;
suddenly he went on a open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured by the prisoners .
&quot; at that time , I saw a li@@ king , on the man who were tor@@ tured . &quot;
she looked like a field@@ bed and metal springs .
&quot; later , I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable car . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was closed there . &quot;
&quot; they sle@@ pt a man with hand@@ maid to the bed , over@@ cast him with water , and brought him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

at the same time it was so easy to use it ... as a sch@@ ema Win@@ del .
&quot; later , when my father was born under the house , the same smell of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me to me : how is it just possible that one person can do so much suffering ?
I knew that this people were killed &apos;
&quot; as my Father me to work , he took me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , he took me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; he said with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , one civilians who were also accused of the trial , and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , where naked men with the face down - all were in hands and feet . &quot;
close to the entrance to the entrance is quiet on the mattress .
&quot; as my father told that I saw that I saw , &quot; &quot; What did you know so ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you come to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were thrown into a pit and was buried in a pit , and buried . &quot;
I know because my father arrived at home .
&quot; next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were called as a offices . &quot;
&quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero was killed a man and killed him . &quot;
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the long list of Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Din@@ sia , the head of the memorial site La Per@@ la , through the former name chambers . &quot;
the way to which you come here is also the way that brought here to the left .
&quot; if you look on the map , see that they took about this path and then to the first time . &quot;
&quot; here their names were changed , and they were given a part of the process of det@@ oxi@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; when they lived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the Cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the floo@@ ds of man and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War mare &apos;
my father brought all the possible things with home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &apos; War mare &apos; - as it was called &quot; &quot; War &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but when I was later , when I was in the military , I was in the G@@ DR - it was clear that war broke out a Ba@@ jon@@ ett or perhaps military officers who created a enemy . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... sti@@ ckers , then it is not a war , but V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is why theft .
&quot; I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; I understand it , but I understand it . &quot;
&quot; I was also an officer in the morning , and I would never pass it into a house to penet@@ rate it into a house , and to steal everything therein . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a milit@@ ant , and I answered , and you , who are the cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal off@@ ence ?
&quot; he explo@@ its in front of anger , sm@@ ote me , and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you are so far away , I will find you with you , and bring you with you . &quot;
we do not need any other !
so my father was my father .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a single reminder to him . &quot;
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of what I had a jacket and a rolling pin out of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he brought back home with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense , a fellow soldier killed in this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;

the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find a Reu@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have one child , one wants to know the value of a life . &quot;
one is developing and recognize that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far too saying :
&quot; well , you have to be executed during the dictatorship of man . &quot;
why children lead ?
&quot; one day brought my father a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a small girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to bring them into prison .
&quot; I told , it was simply decided to kill these people . &quot;
did these people do not even have families with whom they were able to have their ster@@ ols ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that man can do with man .
my father told me when the democracy has been introduced to remove them machines to remove the det@@ achment of the prisoners .
&quot; they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere else - no c@@ lue , where there is never anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
anything of course do you think of course .
&quot; &apos; I have seen , as you have killed people ! &apos; &quot;
&quot; yes , I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I just tried the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
the thought of my father was created during a conversation when he stood under the house .
&quot; I made him on the ground , because I had to experience all of the grass , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed none . &quot;
&quot; I felt inside me , and asked me , what the whole of patri@@ otic patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they were killed were good . &quot;
&quot; then , I cried : &quot;
how can you tell me about me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
&quot; you have terrible crime , and you have compelled me as a child . &quot;

exactly that did .
&quot; in 2010 , I received the first ad . &quot;
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
&quot; no one can tell me that I am coming to my own Father . I have spoken to my own Father . I finally told my own father . &quot;

this shows that no one can read the translation .
&quot; this is an agreement for older people and in an international city as Kyoto is un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the defective English translation was removed at first . the designation &quot; &quot; Universal Drivers &quot; &quot; was replaced later by the use of the most commonly referred to &quot; &quot; Files &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older Bosch &quot; ) . &quot;

&quot; it is really sorry that older people through the inadequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are diverse .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the actual text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
&quot; the latter requires the active communication of the target language - something that is in your language , in general , the conviction that transl@@ ates transl@@ ators to the target language - not in the output language - mother @-@ language . &quot;
you should translate the language in English in English or French . language : German . English language . language : German . English language . language : German .

but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was treated in this house like a daughter .
&quot; as a ten years old , she started to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta called the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work for school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money is over their min@@ ed @-@ year @-@ old son or her min@@ ed daughter , one another , Reich@@ stag , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not mentioned that the children for countless days of household goods must never be paid and victims will not be charged and victims of abuse and missions are not necessary . &quot;

&quot; on the one hand the family who make their daughter in the faith that they will improve their training in society , and they can improve their position in society and &quot; something out of themselves . &quot;

&quot; six years ago , President of the European Parliament have recently been approved for the regulation of the use of social networks and social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , the user must register their social media in Egypt at a government authority , to register social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , the law would then be set out to use citizens , citizens and citizens a permission to share social media . &quot;

&quot; the legisl@@ ature , which consists of six perf@@ ections , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Hong Independent Independent , defined social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs on the Internet and be used to communicate with others by voice , video recording and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is set out when it is accepted , as Egyptian authorities do not have a notice that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ use Satt@@ ar , President of the Federal Ministry of Law , told the magazine of Al @-@ Monitor , registered user recommendations and users in the tel@@ ecommunication sector and a password &quot; to come to the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those that would be required for the Egyp@@ tians and Egypt , to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known that such plans are not known .
experts and experts prior to the site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical support of the process .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Assistant Professor ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told the Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I have no doubt about the technical capacity and understanding the understanding of any authorities in Egypt , concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; my opinion , after that , as such as they control their physical public and private rooms , it could be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take them seriously , then means that they will receive a strong monitoring system to monitor citizens and not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to monitor them in the case . &quot;
&quot; this is technically , not realistic - but in Egypt , everything possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be approved as a law , the draft must be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session and the constitutional review before it goes into the plen@@ ary situation . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful , or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military of art in parliament , in whose senses the control is present and ensured that no different Nar@@ ration on the image area is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ka@@ y was a proposal for many years ago , in which a life imprisonment for those who had to be found guilty , the &quot; public order to detect &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the heart of Cuba ( Foto : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the people of the Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known that there are no n@@ enn@@ ant sugar on site . &quot;
&quot; it is two years ago , when the activities in the sugar cane design were laid . &quot;
&quot; according to the conservation of the sugar industry in the region , and the factory had lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ors remained in steel and concrete . &quot;

&quot; n@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , which is on every day at 4 : 00 clock , the crisis in the sugar cane industry is not for his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane , which have been re@@ active in operation because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something that he didn &apos;t need .
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Won@@ ita is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already had the case , the case of socialism , the low market prices , and climate change , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount . &quot;
&quot; a few decades ago , the message would have been a motive for the country but the poor are no new . &quot;
why was the k@@ ub@@ ary sugar industry in the industry ?
the old railway station of the church saw already a better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , which was to concentrate on annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; only the factories left the factories , which can produce sugar for each 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane , and the sugar crisis on the world market . &quot;
still the sugar price before a decade .
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the International Monetary Fund , of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutri@@ ent organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the present production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export of around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
everything went well well
&quot; the current day will enter into history , which were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; since then , the process of re@@ structured in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the work of a total of 98 sugar cane doors , more than 65 million people took their full advantage of the training . &quot;

&quot; it was officially recognized by the documents that would be removed only regarding parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were of U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Tor@@ o , just the ministers failed to have any compensation . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility has been over@@ looked and the letters came to be more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the closed factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot;

&quot; he was against his own will , he helped the factory , in which building he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part , he stretched , disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work site was deleted .
&quot; in many cases , no alternative alternatives to work and services that were created in the congregations in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president of the people saw , when he was guaranteed that the factories had no longer in operation , all the factories had no longer in operation . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only high through Mah@@ ab@@ ert . &quot;

&quot; after two years the people learned the Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i that many things do , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar cane factory , or better said , when they began to take them out , they heard them in the street , they were also depri@@ ved of any other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without labour in the region , and with advanced age , n@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories are looking for . &quot;
they have been rated to spare parts .
&quot; without the future , there are many young people the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , the food is created , whose production serves not once for the supply of the church . &quot;

&quot; in reports and foreign media about the &quot; &quot; struggle against the drug trade &quot; in Mexico , however , however , the extent of the human tragedy in Mexico , however , is not the extent of human tragedy , that is not the extent of human tragedy . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ cart@@ ells , the chief of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on day after a violent trial , anyone looking for the trau@@ ma or to the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind every body , behind each bone , the stories of the gra@@ ves , the stories of young parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never cure . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has become a digital project &quot; Apr@@ on a vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade &quot; ) to live with this sacrifice , and stories of people who tells the struggle between the criminal authorities and cart@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico &quot; &quot; describes the project so : &quot;
organic crime is not only in order to fear our lives .
the effects are much lower .
&quot; for example , if you close to the shops because they are threatened by drugs , and all municipalities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victim
&quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ enn@@ que c@@ ambi@@ an p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( german : &quot; as fear life &quot; ) tells exactly this stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father , who is looking for a weekend of mysterious gra@@ ves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost one day their father , their four brothers , their husband , and two of their N@@ eff@@ en lost . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every sun@@ day we prepare ourselves to the task of the task that we have loved us , and after the people who we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in a electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , for I am now with three children that need a training . &quot;
&quot; my mother , who is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it has no income . &quot;
&quot; however , the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , however , it is not possible to demand them because they want to demand a steri@@ lis@@ ation . &quot;
where are we going to get there ?
&quot; the editor of &quot; Apr@@ on a vi@@ vi@@ r con &quot; Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot;
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who show the fear of fear . we need to show the international community of conflicts , the Zer@@ u@@ ity and the state guide . &quot;
the project is based on stories by reading and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some stories from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reading from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the U.S. Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; this post has been edited 1 times , last edit by &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the disease and sensation of journ@@ alism I have been working for some years since some years .
&quot; I come back to newspaper newspaper and see the Tit@@ els@@ page with pictures , which can only be from a teacher &apos;s book for criminals or from thousands of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling , as if I am the one , the attached or sad . it works , as a lack of respect to the person who once had once . &quot;
&quot; as a result , I can not be liable or as normal as normal . &quot;
no review available for this item .
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 years of C@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it is not normal that people use songs on the &quot; &quot; hel@@ d@@ ent@@ aries &quot; , &quot; when it is great . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is that for me , they have lost those who have lost and those who have lost their fear . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are in a statistic .
&quot; it is incredibly difficult for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbourhood , that they were &quot; re@@ alizing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to speak of such trage@@ dies , if they are not , and quiet . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; &quot; four months &quot; &quot; in the main town district : as a family with threats was destroyed , until they had destroyed their business , but also their family apart from their business . &quot;
&quot; you remember all that you have lost , and how many people will change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; pain never goes , the trau@@ ma is too high if you are alone alone . &quot;

&quot; we want to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I have asked myself in these fear@@ ful days , whether there would be my deep@@ est feelings , but the response is no , for I have forgotten how to live . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The Forgotten Coast of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a new generation of violence .
&quot; in the introduction , he asked questions on how : who cares about the child of a miss woman and a man who was murdered from organised crime ? &quot;
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the edge of the sea of Mexican pes@@ o ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents can take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ ans and he tells us that he had to bring himself a egg , potatoes and warm , Tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the Bab@@ ies . this is his name for the preparation of the flame with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every life of life .
&quot; but they are innocent in comparison to the pain in his eyes - invisible for a young boy who had to live for the whole life of violence , and to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day of his childhood .
&quot; his childhood was already two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the blu@@ ff of his father was shot out of armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by the crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 was Ju@@ á@@ rez the most dangerous city of the world due to the number of mor@@ als according to public security and the government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Prosec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
&quot; these are only some of hundreds of thousands of hundreds of thousands of hundreds of thousands of thousands who are able to penet@@ rate the crime in Mexico , and into the soul of the land . &quot;
only a few stories live with always a new issue . this project reminds us of those who don &apos;t forget to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ on a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ uto project , whose aim is to investigate the complex information behind the struggle against the drug trade in the last four decades . &quot;

&quot; but how is it &apos;s time after something the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tend to be . &quot;
we take this photo of a horrible time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication in the first release , it was mis@@ guided to mis@@ ologi@@ ze for the creation of trage@@ dies , actually in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong coupling of image and event - &quot; &quot; false explanation &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; false context &quot; &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - don &apos;t deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but ask questions about our request according to images .
what in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank trol@@ ley the place in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explosion . &quot;
&quot; according to the civil war , Africa has been negl@@ ected in the country . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; tank &quot; &quot; fell into the victim . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a fire@@ ball led by a fire@@ ball , the largest houses , including a cinema in the near , which was full of people who was full of people who had the football world . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there is no limit to the problem . &quot;
many people were burned to the knowledge .

&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in the emp@@ uri@@ ous villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;

there were no translations available .
&quot; only using a satellite images , the subsequent time has been shown below . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack remained un@@ justified , but the armies of Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military court and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the picture made out of the DR Congo again , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the An@@ gri@@ ffs were presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;

&quot; so that the President of the United Nations believes that the President of the United Nations believes that mon@@ ks and politicians are involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image of S@@ ung . &quot;
the article was updated and at the time of this publication is the picture still included .

&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( inhal@@ ed ) , which are focused on religion . the first frame is focused on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims or - to the defense of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an afri@@ can life compared to a European or French life .
&quot; religion wants to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is important to investigate how images in connection with these efforts are used . &quot;
&quot; however , what happens , what happens when reading these images is no longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are plenty of people who have un@@ authorised the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the spread of the dis@@ asters have already been discussed at the same time ( for example ) .
&quot; a argument is that which comes from images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy , and sometimes they will be able to recognize these images even from the victims of victims . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the wor@@ sen@@ ing images of readers and spectators will take the ability to feel the ability to find out Emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the findings , and help others to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while it is important to discuss with regard to the news media , the fact that it is essential that it is essential for the current financial reporting . &quot;
&quot; to support the struggle against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; , &quot; you will need to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will need to be able to think about situation , which actually can be solved from the context or to completely ab@@ omin@@ able manner . &quot;

&quot; according to the information of Facebook , the well @-@ known social network was their mark out of the network because it was the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements of the Word is an extremely valuable con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly of ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ an against Muslims who uses a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight Hass@@ an , the company has a lot of useful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; it is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the Word is not automatically created in Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the context is important to # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they have been discussed in which they have discussed the use of the word , or doubts about the use of the word . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ous words with basic knowledge that have the same letter as &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on the Bur@@ ph@@ ar also &apos; kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters as well as others like &apos; kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( c@@ ac@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ iv &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ dle of My@@ at explained the various forms of words by words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of my friends was mistakenly deleted , because it was the word of kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on the spiritual way , whether they were sick , as he did his back pain , by taking a word of words . &quot;
&quot; the set of ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ naire ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - similar to the racial expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win is the opinion that they expect to Hass@@ an radical nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook analy@@ tic should be able before it will be able to spread all the reports . &quot;
read the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually manually .
it fil@@ let the word automatically .
it is not easy to understand what you are looking for Fac@@ ing .
&quot; what it should happen , it is carefully to analyse the post carefully and control him by selecting the above words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age b@@ sen ) .
&quot; the good thing is that this dre@@ amy nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ an , a pretty good thing . &quot;
now it &apos;s time to become one &apos;s nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action is a strong signal to everyone may spread the Hass@@ an , the efficiency of these strategy is not long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bel and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , where the users can simply start to press a new word or alternative writing of the dead word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ at My@@ at , like Facebook to delete his posts as he wanted to delete his friends , when he wanted to delete his friends , that the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is said : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to write my Facebook friends that the word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was under@@ lined the li@@ ken , posts and parts of contents for 24 hours . &quot;
Facebook has a number of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ a radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed with Hass@@ an :
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author wrote his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations were poor@@ ly poor@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have to do with the beginning of the initiative , for example the bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; on Facebook ACS at Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
these words fail to make these words even more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without the local context or technical support , so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even as they have found out that they did not do , they tried to correct them not to correct them . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have more respect for the 15 million benefit , the great revenues would be great . &quot;

&quot; in many parts of India , women with great care , the names of their husband or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a prono@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect their husband , as well as fear in the consequences of the consequences . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of her wife is also widespread in the name of name , even under men . however , they are much less likely to fear when at all , they should not come in practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health care as well as house@@ wives , a unique K@@ lub , and thus quickly became the main attraction of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , at which they discuss the quality of Patri@@ arch@@ ats and discuss . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which will be operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and for the disman@@ t@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; for seven years , for seven years with the help of their video cameras on the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s and AIDS In@@ dependence , and leads to these clubs . &quot;
they told them how they created a safe place for these women and they have made a safe place for these women and at the same time at the same time .
&quot; the first video , the raw ini in its discussion round , followed by women who do not call their husband not to name . &quot;
&quot; for this topic , because they decided to identify the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify women . &quot;
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands are not no@@ isy , but it is also that they never have to be guilty and never did in question . &quot;

this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman wants to respect her husband and wants him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t make this happen as a woman without mor@@ nings .
the tradition is so deep rooted that we have never done up to this discussion .
at the beginning she wanted to try to try her husband to try to try at home as it runs .
&quot; she showed the video of the discussion round her husband , and her mother nut . &quot;
Roh@@ it says :
&quot; my swimming pool and my husband died still , after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; my husband , my husband turns to me , and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;

&quot; many women had the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ at &quot; . &quot; some believed that there was a good thing because it was meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video project , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in gear . &quot;
&quot; it is the only way to say that there is a lot of people who want to do with different feelings - happy , ver@@ ily , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then asked him all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want to respect ourselves ? &quot;
should not be uns@@ eri@@ alized ?
&quot; some of these women have been married , and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husband over the lips over the lips . &quot;
Roh@@ it says :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the exercise of exercise , another decided to allow the whole de@@ par@@ able fru@@ stration against him and his family . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it .
&quot; even in A@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ te , we decided to have broken down the women that they would actually try to name their husband to name . &quot;
and she kept her word .
&quot; in the next days , raw material has a multitude of reports . &quot;
&quot; the husband has called a woman called the raw ini to and asked what ideas they were in the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; as their hard nut ni@@ bs , she got fear , and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a number of participants was less interested in understanding and the situation in violence .
&quot; to stop how women tried to stop others , such as women tried to stop other practices , such as for example the sli@@ ghtest red point on the foreh@@ ead , which shows the fl@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ ess red point if he would also do it . &quot;
he laugh@@ s only and I heard it to wear him .
&quot; the other women do not belong to the other women , but they are now working on a better position to choose him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can overcome their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not make a trip to any discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; usually , we have lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women who could hear what might hear , &quot; says she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they were in their own birth@@ days with cakes : they are dancing and s@@ worn over things , over which they never had never thought . &quot;
raw ini says :
&quot; I have been working for so many years of these problems and yet I also have some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our husband . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say some things according to say , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we have learned about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have been taken in the group since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to have a sal@@ ta @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , wear them . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes , mor@@ tification with the Sar@@ is and much more , it was connected with the Sar@@ is and more . &quot;
&quot; in the next few days they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear it and raw ini is sure that it will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion has changed something , confirmed that things slowly come into the rolls : &quot;
we &apos;ve been made only small steps .
&quot; some women show it a few times , but then we heard the name of their husband to say to the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , me , if they are , but only if they are alone and no other family members are . &quot;
only one or two others continue to bear the name of their husband ; only one or two women are now working at any time of Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ ead .
&quot; the women in discussion will know that the changes that they want to reach out in their lives - like the fo@@ oth@@ ills of more movement , or the own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate . &quot;
they are aware that they are aware of their self @-@ confidence that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
any of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ats .
I am also in love with you .
but this K@@ lub are every one of us that will change something .
&quot; and I know that it is not only on 30 families . it will be restricted to 30 families , when every woman in the club goes back home , and other people of whom we talk and what we do . &quot;
we sit down all in the same boat .

Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be like as Singapore on international level as a independent state is recognized .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore as a city . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; during meeting of a meeting of the international twin @-@ chamber of the state of the state of the state of the state of New York , the Minister , that many people were compared to the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared to other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one has set in question whether New York is a democracy ? ...
this is where most people have a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io , the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; logic to turn &quot; &quot; to defend the existing circumstances of the power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , this valuable land is to create this valuable land . &quot;
your email address will not be published . required fields are marked *
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my land , eat it ? &quot;
&quot; in the case of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am given reasons not very no@@ bel : he pointed out a idea , according to which the political system of Singapore does not measure the political system of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; in other words , Singapore will be compared with cities as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities which are permanently taken from a party . &quot;

&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion , since they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion . &quot;
I think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
but I don &apos;t understand anything .
&quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our beloved K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am going to be up to take this point , if he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by An@@ on on the blog , he has to read his comment on the critics of the conference , so that one should be better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better . &quot;
read the Contri@@ but@@ ors .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , he explained , why the elections in Singapore has been so important for us , even if we make us free and just issues . &quot;
&quot; in Singapore , Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party ? ) . &quot;
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is no country , &quot; he has no country in this sense . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appearances on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who makes a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Singapore said , very useful ... &quot;
&quot; at least , I knew about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that I expected , and not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not sure whether he believes that he really believes and aware of what it is . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review supports the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams himself :
&quot; as a result , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; needs a mistake &quot; or was there a fre@@ ud@@ der speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is no country , we will only be as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , the country will go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is located in the country and city . &quot;
&quot; because he plays an important role within the Government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am of serious significance . &quot;

&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I have visited some of this places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is made by a 59@@ th Anniversary of Mexico , a small woman with a cor@@ rug@@ ated frame and gold colored ear@@ r@@ ingen in a Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ular form . &quot;
the Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ o was born and was grown up in tap@@ ach@@ ula and has been grown up in tap@@ ach@@ ula . yet they know many among the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with k@@ ven@@ ous walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
the par@@ ser implementations we used for this check are based on Open@@ SP ( SG@@ ML / XML ) and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 ( XML ) .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ ary migrants here .
&quot; sometimes Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people in full small bus@@ ses and the upper part of the coast begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ?
at the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has been received 200 guests at the same time .
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already been made outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;

the family came from Angola to Brazil and continue to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; I feel that it fits , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Lady &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she is the heart of a mother ...
we feel very happy here .
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao go travel with his sister to reach Boston , to reach Boston , to reach its husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they already lived in Brazil , however , there is a few Afri@@ cans who are in the United States to make a first stop in South America and then towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other symbols of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often together the route , and that the Afri@@ cans were already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his journey , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and has worked as building workers on the construction site of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he has started his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest for months at home Africa : he sold a cards to save the necessary money to save the bus ticket to Ti@@ po .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez Contact .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we can never go back again , &quot; reply he smiling . &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages if they are sent to them or to tell you about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith of the drive of their work is .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have been brought to prepare for chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known but it is not the only Funk@@ y hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a sack to Is@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ci@@ ela .
this winter was recorded in Valen@@ ci@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
&quot; he is polic@@ eman , and found that the bus tickets to be sold to numerous African migrants . &quot;
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered his house for a dollar . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and cooking outside . &quot;

there are places where people help and others not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he became a Raz@@ zia on his work@@ station from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;

&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are compelled to install a Spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district , the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a phone noti@@ fications which has to install the District government , a monitoring application named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the course , the app is said that the app &quot; will be to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the authorities can also use the app also for more than the fight of terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive reporting period from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were taken at autonomous and Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had been replaced with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the police that the app lists and the distribution channels of terrorists and persec@@ utions , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective box for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block of porno@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ ans , and ph@@ arma pages to make sure how much time they spend online and to control the own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for minorities should help to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can be used in many ways .
&quot; for instance , the &quot; remote &quot; remote actors or even m@@ ower , the home network works to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in harmony with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while news about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China usually concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the Middle East and South , the reality is very often di@@ ster@@ er for those who live in distant , rising ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often have extreme ti@@ ens@@ ations and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely information on the internet . &quot;
&quot; this is based on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; images from main@@ land China &quot; , &quot; which was released by a Check@@ point in China , showed photos by an Check@@ point , which had been released by a Check@@ point where they had been installed on the monitoring application . &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in a series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the active part is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you will see yourself and understand that you &apos;re alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
&quot; everything has changed after and after the truth and a truth , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes her name all honor .
one who has to do in a list of ge@@ ance and press down which is not a metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you come back to reality , and you will be back behind the scenes - beyond the actors , beautiful scenes and performers - transform the characters in the essence of flesh and blood , and all lam@@ bs according to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth is going on the road of the un@@ hei@@ r . you will be clear that you have built here between the walls of your parents , and in front of them your grandfather , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father were arrested , but this was still not so that I could not &quot; &quot; my lum@@ ber &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security forces - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he added his power over us under the proof that he might destroy the simpl@@ est concepts that we k@@ issed .
&quot; five young people were destroyed during a peaceful protests , such as accidents from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; the town of &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; was placed in the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the city district , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ain , at the wrong time , even if I don &apos;t have no high demands on a city built up to the Ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in the third night the things had some cal@@ ming , after the power supply in the neighborhood had heard . &quot;
&quot; I saw the silence , by using several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends have enough enough to find that . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends came to me ; we burned to a beautiful picture that my expectations fully and completely filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you aware that you are the Spirit from the lamp , but you don &apos;t know you just in the smell . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; do you ready to meet us at the Military Security building . &quot;
he went on .
&quot; then I learned , no matter how much honey you go away - nothing can give you your voice to you , after you have given you all the way to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I came back there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now . &quot;
&quot; the col@@ lage of Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you are only to cry enough if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
the secret eyes were filled with me .
&quot; and thou shou@@ ld@@ nt know what to look up in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before the building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my foo@@ lish , E@@ it@@ el@@ essness ; perhaps of the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I did not know that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never heard you in the eyes , so why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have been said to me , but I have no word of what I have said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the last 7 days from the last 14 days from the last 100 days
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; Syn@@ drome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture which I was exposed to death . &quot;
from the last 7 days from the last 7 days
&quot; in the first office , I show everything I am with me . &quot;
&quot; then again , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear on the individual cells . &quot;
I pre@@ fers all the details exactly before I received the room .
&quot; unlike otherwise , they have shared this time for a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoners , and may contact me with just as otherwise on their permission . &quot;
&quot; after some minutes , like a whole life he left the cell , and I handle on an old @-@ proven communication method . &quot;

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; and in no one of the surrounding cells have a wide man of the middle , which is similar to me and &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , we don &apos;t recognize any distinctive facial features , and doctors there are no numbers : we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers must be entitled to His existence .
perhaps he was laid into one of the large cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; I was always convinced that black the colour of the b@@ ens is , until I saw the yellow light that we saw the Gr@@ ath in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to get rid .
&quot; so that the mystery of the secret : to protect the state security before us and prevent the terrorists into us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so that they played their con@@ sp@@ ies of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , that is no country ; it is a curse that they call it co@@ existence in order to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; cont@@ emp@@ ation , despite the facial express , that you &apos;re still young , you are still young , you can start so much better with your life as you can close this review and get to the demonstrations that will soon be found . &quot;
I did not know .

I really can &apos;t really say when loading and b@@ lows after a friendly conversation .
&quot; when and how happened , it was un@@ important . &quot;
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to be punished , though I had to be punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
a punishment in all of their diversity .
his command is to get me so much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; it is called &quot; &quot; gest@@ ure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it starts with a plastic tube , which probably dates from the monastery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t hold thee with him , and you can not hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; they were not enough for him , but not enough for the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first , I asked me whether the investig@@ ators had worked as garb@@ age as garb@@ age , or whether the normal work equipment was worked . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to present us from their point , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them , while I was still at the number . &quot;
&quot; my voice was lost in my body , and also my voice , why I heard to cry . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ke leaves the cooling down , and found no other in all , why he is as one of the one @-@ charged St@@ ab grip . &quot;
&quot; current state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art work , which has been developed by the European Union and the European Union . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched on the floor , was the perfect power . &quot;
the do@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again there .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided to meet his duty for this night . &quot;
it must be so at midnight .
&quot; I decided to put myself again , and say , that was my only option . &quot;
a couple of hours that came to me like a few minutes .
then the call to the morning .
&quot; the door opens up and the morning light is filled with the room &quot; &quot; R@@ ab with you , But@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer to the voice of a broken youth : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and away you , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .

&quot; the j@@ ord@@ al R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance . &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoke a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was edited by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b brings the most part of his time ; let it go on his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can leave , it is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers , or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ ni@@ cot@@ ine lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house in 1967 ; the year , in which Israel heard his works of the West@@ bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was compelled to hear from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a passionate activity which represents the conservative majority of gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression by art and Rap@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; with his music that is often confused with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry . all these issues are not only in his home city of Am@@ man , but also in cities which is from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself in his thinking not through borders , and he can feel his own statement with the people who are able to suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it is not open to the US American foreign policy , the American foreign policy has a particular concern . &quot;
the H@@ da@@ i@@ b makes his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
date Modi@@ fied User@@ name Field Change
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas , to do anything with its identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own lives , &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he added : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I think I am a man &quot; , &quot; while he began to fa@@ sten N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the Holy Month Ram@@ adan , in this time it is planned for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise until sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ al Law is in fact that the public ornam@@ ents of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking the old traditions ; on the other , a cup of coffee is a hot girl with an sen@@ timent . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the Schl@@ em@@ mer coffee and the best to the Kent cigar@@ ette in the nose is first in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes the Jordan , like a prison under free heaven , especially when you have a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s simple to do basic things - as in the midst of the Ram@@ adan water - to drink not in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Jordan &apos;s Ministry of Jordan has an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la before the second time . &quot;
&quot; some of the MEPs who support the Islamic State &apos;s Front - argue that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual trans@@ gres@@ ses Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , says and the main reason for the concert table . &quot;
&quot; in a interview with CN@@ N that the concert will have been told in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert will have been told in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; straight &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many say , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free movement of expression in the Arab world &quot;
&quot; in a public statement in M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ ula &apos;s people as &quot; progressive Supp@@ er of human rights &quot; , &quot; which still decided to use a intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to sei@@ ze the rhet@@ oric reality , but actually there are more serious reality in Jordan that reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2016 back H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional families , making his vision of Arab women , formed by the fate of Arab women . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of an impressive unknown woman , whose arms and legs up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who are actually trust .
&quot; in the past few years , Jordan took part in Jordan the number of &quot; honor@@ ary mor@@ als &quot; in Jordan . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary states in the year 2016 their peak ; however , however , the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support the victims of the victim or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on the break@@ age of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to internal families are often exposed to un@@ specific time in prison , and for their participation is often a long @-@ bureauc@@ ratic effort , and the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music is a great popularity and is well known for , too . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b showed that his work is politically , however , that he is his music , the full of explicit forms of sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &quot; , H@@ da@@ i@@ b took the question after the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are in the core policy can continue to continue .
&quot; in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b had a song with the title &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is often called &quot; &quot; verse &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and every other is also . &quot;
&quot; in the further development of the songs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is the world as a sort market , on which one wants to get in his words , &quot; &quot; is faith or non @-@ believe , environmental or hom@@ osex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that barely anyone in Jordan over the rights of sw@@ elling and Les@@ bes speaks , and that &apos;s comments for equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still in the year 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b was an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ al online programme of Ro@@ ya to find later that his comments from the context had been torn down , and his own opinion . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , H@@ da@@ i@@ b open open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that the tolerance towards homosexu@@ als are not of Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned , Abu Gh@@ ent , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in remembrance thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems in remembrance . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b said : if Abu K@@ alle , who was later on behalf of the cali@@ ber work , in the eighth century open to homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ ani@@ er does not work ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so h@@ da@@ i@@ b , nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was spoken to do . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new more that the government attacks on freedom of expression , and that the progressive regime will be brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; yet recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ ula news service took several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the reason they would have to be taken up to the comments in social media . &quot;
&quot; at the end of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs is just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him the progress of the progress is a difficult , but the way of progress - so that H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a appearance on the second time , but the path of the progress - so sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . it is sure that this changes will take place in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ ship society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other people , too , from an Arab world without intervention abroad . &quot;
&quot; he was not only to bring his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem , and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region offers music , art and literature of a real and basic openness . &quot;
&quot; as far as far as far as far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to be resist@@ ed and also resist@@ ed resistance . &quot;

&quot; in this history , the outer appearance and body care are so important as in this story , because they help to promote the per@@ enni@@ al youth from the Crime time and a le@@ ti@@ ful career like the hair@@ dres@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historical centre of Lima - a region with a very high rate rates , where tram and illegal drugs are daily daily . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - how many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance , and thus the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men , such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Brazil ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Brazil ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , even a annual event is inspired by the competition of the hair@@ style of your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are experts in order to show each other in order to show that by them the exotic L@@ ooks can create ( more videos on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , found in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to convince their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the best possibilities have seen dozens of people seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
&quot; the school was in front of the school year &apos;s school year of special training workshops , and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only technical school in the church and the district , which we have very proud to have this education of education . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great deal . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the written version of the writer &quot; love message to us &quot; which is published in the international online magazine Tea After T@@ welve .
the contribution will be published here in the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why write we only love to people who we know ?
&quot; it is not much more important , people who are able to carry out what you can do . &quot;
&quot; this question was about the two young colonial activists , Leonardo P@@ á@@ ra@@ ga from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer from the head and inspiring them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; first of all , their country was held in front of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to a peace agreement with the first aid of the longest armed conflict with the first armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the International Criminal Court has been so significant that the colonial President José Manuel San@@ tos for its services at the Peace Prize was received . &quot;
it is still a long way to speak to one of real reconciliation and peace .
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ il@@ la@@ k@@ eth , who lived for many years in illegal bearings , a war of war were killed and around the clock , now have to integrate their weapons into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; in some cases , the colonial society has to be in constant anxiety and in some cases deep in some cases , this now has to support them into their ranks , and they will help them to build a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young investig@@ ators help themselves together with integration process and integration process .
&quot; and exactly that they did : until now , thousands of young people were written - love message to former journalists , to be welcome back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former Member of us .
no Events were found with the defined settings Biwak # 17 : wild Food
&quot; in February 2017 , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian has been awarded the opportunity to speak in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there was Leonardo and Cris@@ tian the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people that we love to love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those forgotten that they need much easier . &quot;
&quot; in this year , he told him to share his love with people who were at the most urgent effort . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC have to write their place in society and to make a new life . &quot;
&quot; now , in the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities , like Cal@@ i , manipulation , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; I would never thought that someone would be for@@ given me &quot;
the first 500 letters were held on 19 March in one of the UN @-@ camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art in the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
members of the F@@ ARC created so how they had done previously in order to pull the commands of their leader .
&quot; but this time they did not received the commands , but letters of sub@@ strates from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; there was a very mobile moment for all parties . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can walk in only a few hours - from fear to happiness , and everything that is in between . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , had an unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; as we had passed the letters , he led me a former officer by the camp of the camp . &quot;
&quot; when I was in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of tabern@@ acle which I had to live ) , I saw a lot of things I wrote . &quot;
&quot; I had fear to go , because besides him on the bed it was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ lights , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ bracht . &quot;
&quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; How do you make it right ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that is written by me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless .
&quot; in my life he has never been written in my life , that &apos;s why I was looking for . &quot;
&quot; I um@@ ented him very tight , and set me apart from the gran@@ ules . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was the war , it was sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this cat , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never thought something else from life . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society where you are waiting for us .
until now I have learned how I have to work with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace is coming , I can learn many things to learn and in dignity . &quot;
a new voices
&quot; for the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC already in the bor@@ dered . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation to develop their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced how the social ine@@ quality of the peas@@ antry to develop in a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for one goal of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people hear , which have never been found dead , and to recognize that people who are often seen as monsters and even have learned that people who are often seen as Monster and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality that lives in the country is alive .
&quot; but in fact , all people - even those who are killed and so much damage can bring us something and a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many of the Jews have lost their letters to the letters . &quot;
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z , the Command of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote to Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
Originaltitel : the Storm ( TV ) ( TV ) ( TV )
this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it im@@ puri@@ ties , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to access the weapons and to protect their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) . &quot;
we of the F@@ ARC now on peace to a policy without weapons .
&quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace to - regardless of the breed , religion or ideology they belong to all those who live from a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our contribution to our contribution and bring victims , as we know of own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of the existence , are many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way it will give lots of obstacles , but we will overcome them . &quot;

hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ fied people who live in the Kau@@ kas@@ al region are exposed to a large range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence . &quot;
&quot; with terror , the reporting of the last months over the persecution were experienced in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat that like a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ine &apos;s LGB@@ T@@ Q community depends on night , not only about night . &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny to speak with us and with us about what currently happening in the Republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal position in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has published several months after reports that were published , torture and killing men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist , Elena Mil@@ os@@ ina in the Now@@ ak Gas@@ eta ; they cast a light on the methods of the tsch@@ em@@ ic authorities that were suspected of men , and they were released in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ ling@@ ton . &quot;
&quot; you have a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Sab@@ rina was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
since their childhood they felt that they had a woman .
&quot; when they grow up , it was aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no more safe place for it , why they came to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of the sexual intercourse , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; in fear of her life , she died in the US . &quot;
19.09.2016 11 : 40 Poroshenko : Ukraine still interested in le@@ thal arms deliveries from West
&quot; one day , I told me that someone did my help . &quot;
&quot; in order to send an email to this question , you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her to help her , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the Internet , with my phone and a picture of me . &quot;
then the photos of my documents by all W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the lap .
on 10 October 2015 I attacked .
&quot; when I was just a few shops , I heard a male voice , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you by your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I walk to my body , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on ch@@ urch@@ ill : &quot; &quot; how long will you take the family even so long ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I know that there was a young man , no more than 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and understanding the last angels in the hospital again .

the man was bra@@ ided .
the women had a nurse .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two key reasons in my right direction . &quot;
OC Media : in which clinical trials were laid out - in the men or women ?
&quot; Is@@ aiah said , &quot; &quot; My documents are ver@@ ily , as there is my male voice , but the doctor did and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for me .
&quot; when I told his name to his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ fied , a k@@ az@@ zy name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has gone with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
&quot; posted in English , English , French , Russian , Russian ministers discuss situation in eastern Ukraine &quot;
&quot; they called me to tell me - related to me , stran@@ gers , some totally unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a Alp@@ ina .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some other relatives .
&quot; a long time ago , I would like to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set the absurd demands : some said me , I &apos;m going to prove that I was in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , and say that I was not changed to my gender TV . &quot;
what would I have to say - what would I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people spoke once my mother at the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , that not only your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t let it , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother was too much , and put up a Stri@@ ck around the neck . &quot;
&quot; for happiness came the neighb@@ ors , and save them . &quot;
at the moment I had to change times several times the apartment .
&quot; I went into a flat and already a few hours later , under the windows a car with a dark window and a number of rows . &quot;
&quot; after it happened to the third time , it was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
but my human rights @-@ friends over@@ fill the Num@@ bers of Num@@ bers - it turned out that I was given .
OC Media : how do you hear ?

&quot; but I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I want to say that I am looking for them all of them . they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then a bit un@@ disp@@ uted . &quot;
I can still understand how it could be .

&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security , only because you have left the land ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you have gone . they know even your room number .
&quot; to prove it , it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 2,@@ 0@@ 84 173 &quot;
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
we don &apos;t want to talk about the sexual intercourse we don &apos;t know what is a tab@@ u@@ thema .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
&quot; but I also wish to meet these things , I cannot overcome these spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I say that , as long as my mother &apos;s life is , I will do my best to do it . &quot;
&quot; if we do with a camera , I can actually remember how the person may look out of their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current position in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do those who have stayed in their lives ?
I : I have a report in Washington .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
I spoke with someone who has one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ adan could hardly wait for the end of the Ram@@ adan , and he lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and related topics .
&quot; so that my way , I want to learn the relatives of the relatives - that &apos;s about the problem with the affected person and at the end , that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood . &quot;
OC Media : are you still pregnant men in these mysteries ?
&quot; 11 : 55 PM , Mar 27th , 2011 via Twitter for Mac in reply to fas@@ el &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or the relatives of their relatives were left to place Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be able to present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; should they be brought to show their bodies in television , and claim that they could be attacked any village or military support . &quot;
understand how to understand ?
&quot; as a result , these people were not simply missing , but under@@ lined to radic@@ ally . &quot;
OC Media : what is now only a suggestion or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I have just someone who had one and a half months in Ar@@ i .
he says that many people were gone in this prison after her b@@ art was grown .
there were nothing new from them .
they have just been taken out .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , these person had been taken for itself , as these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now they were introduced to Ban@@ di@@ ans , there were no reports . we decided that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you not allowed this people to sh@@ ave to you ?
&quot; in the past few years , however , in the past few years , we have been working in the past few years . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I know my hair always always long . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob . &quot;
I think it &apos;s been well @-@ known since 2003 I already lived there as I lived there and I had never problems .
be the first to rate this product
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , than the Sch@@ aria had never been problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; non @-@ corro@@ sive &quot; time , but ultimately , but ultimately , in the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria @-@ law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were fixed ; I had painted eyel@@ ashes .
the Ministry of Interior of Sch@@ aria has never been a hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theater in Gros@@ ny there were a place where every evening , especially on week@@ ends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , there were there . &quot;
we have never been offensive .
&quot; in the official language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; does not stop the evil one another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children if they make the crane gam@@ eplay .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes before you , because they believed , you &apos;re sick ? &quot;

&quot; you have never been wrong , never filled . &quot;
OC Media : how long gone this Gn@@ ad@@ den time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
&quot; as he was appointed as a prime minister , he began to speak on television . &quot;
&quot; he said not about us , but the priority over the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time when I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic of the republic . &quot;
OC Media : what activities do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work in the basement .
&quot; I don &apos;t know much - 700 to 800 dollars per month , in the United States not much . &quot;

OC Media : do you have a Name ?
I don &apos;t know what to do .
&quot; what is the nature of nature , that has purely nothing with religion . &quot;
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you with shame before the mouth that there is no sw@@ elling .
&quot; the same time , the Cab@@ ard@@ iner , which also have a number of Russians who have also seen in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it &apos;s un@@ comfortable to listen to me . &quot;
I tre@@ ach here as many men from the Kau@@ kas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and during the Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think of tran@@ sposi@@ tion of men who love men , and they believe that you would change their gender experiences to make more intimate experiences . but this is a Tru@@ g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exactly , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s most important to feel me in my own skin and not for my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;

&quot; he l@@ itt under certain conditions , depression , and he bow@@ ed himself for his own help , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z work and an@@ onym@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube Video , the moments , after he had set himself . &quot;
&quot; some people were fast to delete the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the valley of Ah@@ wa@@ z into the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to the local authorities , the combustion engines were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only self @-@ este@@ em that comes in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists before place that still more men could take a life . &quot;

&quot; their stories have a matter together : there were all family members , who fled to the persecution against the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ s and unc@@ lean , their families to feed their families and a safe work . &quot;
&quot; facets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of the Iran @-@ Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was a profound economic crisis , the local Arab population was difficult to ride their lives . &quot;
&quot; before a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an independent region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy took power , and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in the entire Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the A@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran @-@ coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most successful and valuable materials for the Irish agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , regional economy is still slow , and the native population gets only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of un@@ interrupted diseases , hunger and differentiation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime refused to learn more jobs in the local oil , gas and gas chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of st@@ ables , the water from the Arab areas in the Persian fields , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these pit@@ ches have only managed to destroy that in the region through the drying process , and the local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the unemployment rate was less than 25 % . &quot;

&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that the unemployment rate has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z , and a anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the control process : &quot;
&quot; as function@@ aries and institutions do not use Arab labour forces , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will receive access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young people , and to force them to force their lives outside of the homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their advantages and re@@ names to hide their name to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as well as Arab name at the workplace . &quot;

&quot; why I don &apos;t know with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality &quot;
&quot; detail of a photos , recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License . &quot;
&quot; the following article is an over@@ worked version of the opinion , which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , and originally on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as was published . the article was the object of several discussions which came to the expression of various positions . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I don &apos;t have a femin@@ inity , many women - especially white women who are themselves as inter@@ rog@@ ated fem@@ ini@@ ties - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; now , why I am not part of the movement . &quot;
&quot; for example , research and social arguments before me , why I should be Fem@@ inist , and why we should be generally speaking in all the fields * . &quot;
&quot; for instance , women are still less than less money than men . &quot;
&quot; that is why women are still under stric@@ ter , when it comes to what they do with their bodies . &quot;
violence against women a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still need to ensure that women &apos;s or later in various areas of life on a gl@@ ac@@ ne covering , and that discrimination due to the many different countries and buildings . &quot;
all this is aware of me .
I am convinced and I was double and three times .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I have to talk to skin color on the black c@@ is women , on black women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Fem@@ por@@ a . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all of us that women - all women should come together to sing &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing to sing the equality ( some of the women ) . &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about sex@@ ually violence a institutional form of racial or motiv@@ ating violence that we are exposed to black women on two times .
&quot; or about this , black women and women are less than men and women and women are less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black Sp@@ h@@ ears and women with migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want to make sure all men all men and all men have neither skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I can take it as a black woman not a movement , in whose center the white woman is unable to take into account , both on the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted , and will no longer be able to fight against my experiences in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented co@@ h@@ ort@@ ality that has always been rejected by me and countless other black women and always again . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I have no woman in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I asked me to receive a ideology that is in a historical context . &quot;
I asked myself to close me group that would like to close to a group of cultural and habits to drive their ego@@ ing program .
&quot; I will not try to try white women &apos;s importance of over@@ tones of skin colour and gender equality . for some of them will continue the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to make them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ist femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I cut it before , but full of femin@@ ism and me the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman into life , rather than a white feminist paradigm being celebrated than a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and we have created us to be created by us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hud@@ son @-@ We@@ ed , the author of the book of Afri@@ cans , the author of the book of Afri@@ cans , and not only the - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ rog@@ ated fem@@ ini@@ ties immediately after they have read this lines , please let us know about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , from which the black wife is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ending environment I can do black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm . &quot;
I will be recognized due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black wife can have a black wife , in a environment where my life is neither over@@ looked , nor are ignored . &quot;

most of the names were changed to the protection of the affected persons .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena .
&quot; since the end of their relationship was a little time , and the police said , their statement would be laid down to the files , but more could not do . &quot;

&quot; some days later , the second wife told her ad . &quot;
the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are at once display , they will not receive support from the Sta@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; in many cases the women also depends on the men who want them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , at all at all at any time . &quot;

&quot; there are various information and reports that there are various information and reports that show a social scientific research field in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that demonstrate the scale of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the available numbers are , however , are al@@ right . &quot;

86 % of the ads during the police came from women .
&quot; there was more than 5000 adverti@@ sements for domestic violence in the Peace . also , 86 % of the ads of women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads said 40 % of women , they were physically contrac@@ ted , 55 % of women said of psychological disorders . &quot;
this statistics show that the true level of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Frauen@@ ard@@ i , Bai@@ ard@@ i , only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; on every woman who do not do in Paraguay because of mental dis@@ asters , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who do not do because of the body of the body , two women who do not do this , &quot; explained it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , women are not allowed to document their own criminal proceedings as many women are murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists are at least 12 cases of women in the country . &quot;
the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days have a woman due to violence by men . &quot;

visible mission and a legal system that nothing under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he was appointed to him the name of all of her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , they didn &apos;t want to do it . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . &quot;
I have never thought that I would never thought to be victims of missions .
&quot; when I read about it , I thought that only women are going to under@@ estimate the only women because they can dec@@ eive themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
&quot; on the other hand , Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mission by Carlos Vera . &quot;
&quot; without name , they wrote them on Facebook , in which they were isolated and various attacks during their two @-@ year @-@ term relationship , and told how he had isolated it . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked how he asked the hand against them , and refused to know that his behavior also was a form of mission . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
it seemed to be almost as they wanted to say that victims of iniquity are at least a certain person .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who are not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partners are afraid . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that are all in any way victims of mission .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with other about their experiences , each other , and each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : you take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything started with mental stress . &quot;
&quot; as a result , their prosper@@ ous partners can finally convince them to convince them that they were valuable . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as adverti@@ sements for the authorities remained without result , and also by their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against their former partner , which was developed to a tight struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly for money , power and the influence of their former Partners . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of missions is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the United States , &quot; &quot; Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , is also great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , was discussed under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Princip@@ le ) . &quot;
this H@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non Channel ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law sees , fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent audi@@ ologist , as it has already been in the neighbouring countries in Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in some cases , the legisl@@ ature is in some points in order to win the MPs for the law , the fear of de@@ preci@@ ation of de@@ preci@@ ation , the currently in Paraguay , and to be punished with up to five years of imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original legisl@@ ates had been planned , the most part of the ( bureauc@@ ratic and economic ) process costs , the victims of violence against themselves . &quot;
&quot; if the law is not effective , the law does not be effective if the legisl@@ ature does not have sufficient financial means : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mission in Paraguay is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , there must be a re@@ think that violence is no more than a bit of normal . &quot;

how do they differ from those in Western countries ?

&quot; from the United States to India : as &quot; open source &quot; -@@ seed , the global food production may change . &quot;
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared originally on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank M@@ orton have been committed since the 1980s for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ ded , the first plant which has been used by N@@ ASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; more than 20 years of Mort@@ on work only through its own uniqu@@ eness , and the question how many sal@@ at@@ eries can get borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he told that more Sal@@ ate pat@@ rons became more and that he could not use them to the bre@@ wery . &quot;
&quot; the patents were not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics like resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more of such patents have always been used more plants such as cereal or cart@@ els sites . due to this trends they provide plant cultivation , environmental protection and expertise for food safety for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representatives of a year@@ ling old tradition , M@@ orton still still bre@@ wing , he needs to be more than now , since his work is more than ever more restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it is , when it is in a river a rock @-@ rock , which has to be her@@ edit@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding @-@ tradition &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents have to go to Sal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; and when they hold on the court , no one can say no more a new sal@@ at@@ ness because all the features are produced and tries to fix those features , which he would like . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tried to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it also has a movement that is always connected to the United States and everywhere around the world .
&quot; A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS , red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at at the variety of out@@ red@@ ness in the &quot; threaded area &quot; of the station . it will be tested , whether plants can be used in space space . &quot;

&quot; it is no accident that this name rather sounds like sounds , as if the movement from the IT area are not from the range of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the open source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; software . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that some of the plant species are protected , not as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , in brief O@@ ss@@ i , the US bre@@ eder can be committed to use other things that they used by them had grown free . &quot;
&quot; it does not mean that they do not continue to sell themselves with their seed . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder allows others to buy their seed , and not immediately em@@ bark@@ ed - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ern@@ ers . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .

a question of view
&quot; plants are designed so that they are commonly used characteristics - from such that their taste or color improved to such , due to them in certain environments , such as pest control or diseases . &quot;
&quot; the opponents of the plant leaves on plant properties , that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is now increasingly important than ever before , since the modified conditions caused by climate change could be much worse than ever before . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to Spre@@ ew@@ ing is important and also vital for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ ders and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan to promote innovation and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ype innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that allows everyone to follow , as soon as the patent is expected . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; such protection is not a innovation , but also promotes it by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; M@@ orton , that is different : 20 years old , to wait until a patent is certainly not a innovation . &quot;
&quot; and when you are waiting for a long time to wait for plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main point of M@@ orton is that genetic resources are always been very good and it will remain a general help for such formul@@ as , and mon@@ et@@ aires are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to facilitate the farmer &apos;s work .
&quot; this is what us know , and it is impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , M@@ orton with the concept to patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; we create the features not really . &quot;
&quot; the plants form they themselves and as bre@@ eder , we have no idea how to do the plants . &quot;
a mystery of nature .
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ State , and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Executive Committee , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot;
those who believe in the industrial farming with great Higher and Mon@@ ok@@ therapy could be needed for their products of this concept of agriculture .

&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are on international markets , but smaller than such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most of smaller seed companies can either sit and hold it for expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ded or both is the case . &quot;
Frank M@@ orton is looking forward to his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .

&quot; M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eder of plant pat@@ inated innovative , &quot; &quot; it looks like , as I have to produce my efforts to produce new ideas , stronger than companies . &quot;
&quot; I need to sell new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are being able to sell my competitors . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the USA in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding leader , the concept has now become rapidly growing rapidly on the whole world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Development &quot; ) , which describes itself as professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; -@@ seed program is the center with farmers and helps them to meet new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot;
&quot; it supports them , in open source &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed and their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organization doesn &apos;t work at a &quot; Open Source &quot; license , which ultimately has a formal and legal form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
