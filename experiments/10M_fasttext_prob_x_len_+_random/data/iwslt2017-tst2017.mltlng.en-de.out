this is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; you know him , because it won as New York Times @-@ reporter &apos;s Pul@@ itzer Prize won . &quot;
&quot; before the someone of Edward Snow@@ den had heard a book , he wrote a book in which he was spectacular . &quot;
but there is another chapter that should be a lasting impression .
&quot; in this way , he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic presence of US @-@ intelligence service , which gave the CIA to Iran literally over a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , you read it . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know what the chapter does not come out ?
the U.S. Government .
&quot; almost 10 years , the government against the Ris@@ en were determined and asked him to name his own sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he was to condem@@ n the symbol for the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ells and journalists . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right to use this information , if they cannot protect this information and if they do not protect identity of the Mu@@ d , they must be . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as the government of Ris@@ en ank@@ lo@@ ids , he did something that he had already seen before him : he refused and said that he would go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en had to go with the risk to go to jail . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , passive something special . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they had seen many years that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were left off . &quot;

&quot; instead , instead of getting to the statements and Ris@@ en to the statements you may have seen his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they use Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ ler , and to condem@@ n the current source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; however , President Obama said to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ook . but instead it has more than all the US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; since the 11th of September , almost every article on national security is the result of it that a W@@ hist@@ ler Foundation went on a journalists . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we set the press work on the game that is protected by the first constitutional complaints , because the government always has more possibilities to deal with . &quot;
&quot; but as the technology of the government allowed the rights of rep@@ lication , the press can be better to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take them from the moment , in which they contact them , rather than in the neighbour , in Zeu@@ s . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has not yet been written as ris@@ king his book , and it is much safer than normal E @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Help , a open source content management system for W@@ hist@@ ler , which was originally developed by the Internet of the Press Foundation , which was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; rather than a e @-@ mail , go to a news site , like the Washington Post . &quot;

&quot; so , the government cannot find more information secre@@ tly secre@@ tly , and many of the information that would be a request would be not available . &quot;
&quot; only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; however , it is to ensure that not only technology providers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to protect their mis@@ er@@ ections . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ook . &quot;

&quot; however , these technologies are not only for those who want to cover the crime but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .

the publication of this documents are a little insight into the mysterious world of tax ev@@ ils .
&quot; we receive an impression of how clients , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ ley Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need a anonymous company . &quot;
we see the e @-@ mails to the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works .

it is also reports that some allies have killed the brutal dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s assass@@ ination companies in tax ev@@ asion .
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a narrow friend from kinder@@ garten , a famous Cel@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; now , there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait for the next release . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good time for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it seems we@@ t away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go to what we do ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and mighty are able to hide their wealth in tax laws and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health , education , streets . &quot;
and this affects us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , are these revel@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world discuss media and leading politicians , such as the secret control of some few , you have to hide and wear them -- something that we have been looking for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people are very confused , and it is difficult to understand how this tax ev@@ ils work . &quot;
&quot; I want to be reminded by SMS , if Won@@ ita is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; this is a company in another company , in another company , which is almost impossible to understand what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult to understand and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is . &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are less reports about this matter .
&quot; probably , because it was not far from the American Americans , who came into these revel@@ ations , which came into these revel@@ ations . &quot;
now it is not so that there are no other Americans who hide their wealth in tax ev@@ ils .
&quot; but by the principle , according to this tax ev@@ asion , Mos@@ ley Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers . &quot;

it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this in practice looks like .
how does it work ?
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators found themselves as an African Minister , who wanted to buy a house , a yacht , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
us sho@@ cked it really that all until a lawyer of our testim@@ onies how he could understand his money .
&quot; there were all pre @-@ pre@@ fers . none of these companies took us as clients , and of course , in order to be able to make money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to see this not as individual cases .
it is not about an individual lawyer that has to be ren@@ amed .
&quot; it is not about a single level of anti @-@ inflam@@ matory , ver@@ aging themselves into a grave . &quot;

&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
&quot; this may mean everything very different , as if we could do nothing , than whether it would have changed , than if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen much more transparency about the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme was political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU member states on national level , who really is really behind companies in Europe , and who is controlled . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is back .
&quot; the representatives of both parties have a policy in both parties , but this does not do the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama @-@ revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of control , as a means for transparency in the United States and globally for more transparency . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
&quot; we need some people who are angry when they see , as other people will hide their true identity . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to quit the problem by laws this type of in@@ transparent .
&quot; together we can make the in@@ difference , which is now this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I get almost ent@@ angled and in the trunk compartment of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; a day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;

he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I lu@@ de him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you do it today ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I now ?
what does the situation do not know ?
do I have to offer a sleeping area ?
&quot; but I don &apos;t know it yet ! he says , he would go to peace , but I don &apos;t know if he was really plans . &quot;
this is a little girl room !
&quot; then I heard me , &quot; I have a air conditioning . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; h , how ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh my husband ! what I have done in it ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have permission to access / tel@@ la@@ friend@@ .php on this server .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I went out from the bed , on the door , and my sleep @-@ room is closed . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the art of art , which he had bought from me , depends on his class@@ room . &quot;
that was my first experience as host . it has completely changed my view angle .
&quot; perhaps the people who sold me in childhood as a stranger , actually , friends who are only waiting for waiting to be discovered ? &quot;

why ?

it was hard for people to give negative berries .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both host as well as guest reviews , before we received online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we have performed with Stan@@ ford one study . we investigated how probably it is that people are aware of it , like similar them to their age and images . &quot;
&quot; a little , we trust the people who are like most of us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less trust us . &quot;

how does the thought of part with money trans@@ forms together ?
it goes here for economic retail .
&quot; but it is simply just &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; as a result , economy is a trade way of human relationships . &quot;
&quot; people put a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; if you travel today , it is efficient and reliable , it is efficient and reliable , but for less authentic@@ ity . &quot;
what would happen if traveling a rich buffet of local history would be ?
&quot; what would be , if at every place where you would be visited , a group there would have been waiting for a group where you have never heard of a Knei@@ pp area where you still have never heard . &quot;
or if you want to learn food from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would share the apartments of reason for compassion ?
how would you look like this ?
&quot; what would be , if cities would have to accept the thoughts of the common interests ? &quot;
I contact the cities that allow us to make society and relationships instead of work .

&quot; it is not only to be attacked , but in the N@@ u , the acts of others were attacked by others from one citizen . &quot;
&quot; at the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA , to start into a new city and begin with the assembly . &quot;
&quot; I remember the first time , as we went into my seat , and I went to the first time , and I took the first time to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; we stayed in this night in our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw , and heard that I saw the warnings of the national Islamic organizations called &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday in the week -- the day , where Muslims will gather . &quot;
&quot; and again the warts : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw myself the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were un@@ think@@ able , and I heard also from attacks on Muslims , or of people who en@@ du@@ red to Muslims into the free distortion , and sm@@ ote about it . &quot;
there was a fire of mos@@ ques on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt on .
&quot; because people who attacked this country , our country attacked us . &quot;
I have seen the anger of people to the terrorists .
contact us ! I was also angry .

&quot; nowadays , we can say people say : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is to Muslims . &quot;
when will we come back ?
some people want to Muslims to Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my municipality as from a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we b@@ ös@@ ed or less ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or is removed as a whole .
the alternatives are sensu@@ ally because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are the invent@@ ors and teachers , invent@@ ors and Olymp@@ us . &quot;
is the closing of mos@@ ques and America ?
&quot; there will be a few parking lots , but not the terror . &quot;
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to people other faith toler@@ ant and to show greater citizens .
&quot; and as I was a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people will not actually be able in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they will be converted into their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
&quot; as a result , the person who believes in their community has been cut through their family , even from their family to prevent the extre@@ mes of their family , so that the terrorists do believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who believe their behavior and its ideology , is a ver@@ dict or from faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to hold people to hold the mos@@ que to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; some are still speaking , Islam is a violent religion . &quot;
&quot; finally , a group like the IS was their bro@@ ker with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a mother , when man , when man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their pre@@ conditions , when you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if one look at them , it does not stop what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their bro@@ ker who can read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Won@@ ita is on @-@ line . &quot;
a girl came to him because she would have to close the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether they have been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the contrary . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their anger , it was a main objective for the instruments of extre@@ mi@@ sts that you have a solution . &quot;
this is the link to God and its municipality .
&quot; instead , she showed her constructive way for a real time in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the Mos@@ que , enter them to close the IS . &quot;
this was a glimp@@ se like the Islam@@ op@@ ause me and my family .
but how does it work on the normal Americans ?
how does it work on every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour function of fear of any day to our democracy ?
&quot; a study -- actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- : if we fear , we are afraid of at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we accept it as an authorised government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; one study shows : if you give test messages to Muslims in those negative about Muslims , they are rather military attacks on the Muslim countries as well as the communications of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only a acute problem .
&quot; when you look for , when the mood against Muslims after the top run -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this three times , but never in connection with terror . &quot;
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two election .

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
so go back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
&quot; we went to the mos@@ que , and we stayed at home ? &quot;
we set it and for us it was no easy decision because we want to leave our children to leave our children : one that would be able to exercise our religion or in which we can exercise our religion .
we decided to see the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we met with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw myself . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Imam is a announcement , thank@@ ed and was our guests , as the half of the assembly were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers , believers , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to us , but in order to satisfy us . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I have broken down in this moment . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and the Fan@@ ati@@ m ?
are you sure to be sure ?
&quot; or will you connect to those that are : we are better than that . &quot;
thank you .

&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not do . I am totally normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usually as it is allowed .
&quot; if one looks at the Muslims on the whole world , and I did this with the greatest significance to Muslims in all over the world , men want a normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; yes , I have no exception . &quot;

&quot; during our research , we often use basic abstract questions to penet@@ rate the core of the thing . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such question .
they are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that suggests himself to inno@@ c@@ ence .
&quot; before decades , trained drivers were able to fly over two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear light . &quot;
we discovered that flies with only one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ astic , the mechan@@ ically bound flight , it was invented . it was invented before short . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ ots , hing@@ es and trans@@ atlan@@ tic , no further actuators or con@@ gestion surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically , it is very much to fly in the interior , so that it can fly very stable , and to move in space . &quot;
yet it does not exist with the elegant algorithm of the rear wheel . to bring it to the flies .

&quot; when the Mon@@ nier rack is an exercise in Gen@@ ü@@ ff , this machine is here that the Omni@@ directional with his eight prop@@ els , an exercise in excess flow . &quot;
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that it is only balanced .
&quot; as a result , it is an ambi@@ valent condition in its orientation . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he receives the utmost capability , &quot;
&quot; in the space in all directions , regardless of which direction he was fil@@ med or even as he rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight pro@@ vers . &quot;
the rest is only available in models where the rest will learn directly at the bike .
we look forward to seeing you .
&quot; if flight machinery is once a part of our everyday , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller flight machines .
it turns out in the clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise word .
&quot; if you develop them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong . a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or battery -- can continue the machine if even limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this now by taking a half way .
&quot; the last demonstration of the &quot; &quot; synthetic material &quot; &quot; is recommended for the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the coarse number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; as a result , micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weigh@@ s less than a disc bread -- and meet them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms . &quot;
&quot; each unit is white , where the room is controlled and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully these demonstrations are to think about new revolutionary ideas .

of course it is difficult to understand the influence of this technology .
&quot; for types of types like us , the wages in the development and the conductor process . &quot;

they put their energy but not in the form of light free --

&quot; the entire energy was submitted into the room @-@ time @-@ add , and the universe appeared in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot;

&quot; from 1.3 billions of years ago , multilingual life on Earth was built . &quot;
&quot; since then the ground has been brought to the ground : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God created us at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group was particularly brave -- R@@ ai White , and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser alignment to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves . &quot;
they did it for .
&quot; but enough people used as crazy Gen@@ ies , so that US National Science Foundation announced their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much har@@ dening work in the detector LI@@ GO : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ rics Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Ob@@ serv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in subsequent time , the precision of LI@@ GO was significantly increased to improved the performance performance . &quot;
therefore it is therefore called Advanced Light GO .
&quot; in the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was started to test some minor , hard @-@ hard problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only some days after commissioning of the detectors , smoke the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of both sides by the earth through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me

Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were emotional as this :

&quot; all of what I had worked for , is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and col@@ lagen Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ ker like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a balance in the ge@@ aring of space and time .
&quot; when the shaft can be stretched , the space and its complete content into a direction and into another direction . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there are no translations available . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even smiling . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched out of the waves and sm@@ elling . the stretching of an average person was 10 high @-@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means that 20 Nul@@ led according to the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1st @-@ year , the LI@@ GO staff are expected to be crazy . &quot;

&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical . for so , you can perceive a picture or a map of things by adding several points to you . &quot;

hearing aids have a wave length of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore , it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that gives you a lot of things : &quot;

the track is valid for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t work with them no simple pictures of objects in the All .
but by using changes in the Am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves we can make us listen to her stories .
at least one is at least for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in hearing .
&quot; if we want to convert wave samples in shame , we can listen to the All @-@ literally . &quot;

it is a kind of motion that will be drawn into the wave form .

AA : let us know what this means .

imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the meaning of Light .
LI@@ GO is a totally new way to the discovery of the world as they never been before .
&quot; on this way , we can hear the All lau@@ rel and the Un@@ visible . &quot;
so much in all we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not see .

&quot; using Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen , and we have no idea . things that we are just to discover . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO took place in the first place of things that we were not expected . &quot;
&quot; my Kol@@ ke on the WITH , Matt picks , a key member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this theme : me : the way of stars , the black holes , are the din@@ os@@ aur of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from the historic times . the black holes are the suction head for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO allows us a completely different view of events in the All , on the origin of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be able to be as simple as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great storage and the noise and circulation of the universe . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atives -- a very new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ ations on Earth and in All .

&quot; I &apos;m on the way to outside , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , magical you play ? &quot;

I am a neuro@@ log@@ ist .
how most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ log@@ ist , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , a very small ability to self . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lot of disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ log@@ ist .
what is a functional neuro@@ log@@ ist ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; they have a electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to affect the switching circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease .
&quot; neuro@@ logical , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of the brain development is the restor@@ ing of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to us .
a little help can help the brain itself .
the history began before 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time , I was studying Ober@@ s@@ ine and worked on day and night in the emergency . &quot;
often the patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain and the skull pressure rises .
&quot; in order to save life , you need to save the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for example , you have to remove a part of the brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what is my way to do ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not easy task .
&quot; cells from a ge@@ we@@ eds grow , is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you need to find the correct diet , temperature , humidity , and the environment . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many people , it was Jean @-@ François . &quot;
the saw he saw among his micro@@ scope .
that was for us a big surprise .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with great green cells that surround small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you might be able to transform the cells of un@@ ri@@ pe cells that transform cells into any cell type of body .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small n@@ ic of the brain . &quot;
it is advisable to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface of the brain tissue in the OP .
we made a further fascinating treatment : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
&quot; they die , they are unc@@ lean . &quot;
but these cells were kept differently .
they distributed slowly and after a few weeks died .
&quot; we saw a new , strange fung@@ us , which looked like stem cells . &quot;
we needed to understand where they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
&quot; this blue and red cells are hot , Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells . &quot;
we all have them in our brain .
you do not make 4 % of our large dial cells .
you are playing a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they make them for the use of the brain .
but why do they receive us ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they will take part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher levels of brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are in front of a potentially dangerous cell source , the brain . &quot;
we had to prove that .
therefore we decided to develop a experiment .
&quot; we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then the cells are exactly so cultiv@@ able as it is Jean @-@ François &quot;
and they are then mark to mark them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ating , we were able to take care of the individual individual individual . &quot;
call for Papers 12th IWH / IAB @-@ Workshop on Labour Market Policies
one of our first questions was : what happens if we do this cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we do the same cells in the brain tissue of the brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; the room is already occupied by a healthy brain , and we observed that they have been completely removed by a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we have a violation and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ating exactly the same cells and therefore remained the cells . &quot;
here you can see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ ter@@ ated .
&quot; the proof that they show them are these little points . these are the cells that we are in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also help to recover from a brain .
&quot; for this reason , we decided to use mon@@ keys with a manual feed procedure . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they made them very good .
&quot; as they had achieved a stable level of development , the last we had reached the mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex on the hand mot@@ orized area . &quot;
&quot; after that , the mon@@ keys were lost , they could not move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just like it would happen if people would happen , relaxing it up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are gel@@ ding and then try to recover from plastic brain mechanisms . you can recover from a certain degree , just like the mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; as we were sure that the A@@ ffe be reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation , impl@@ ant we had its own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the mon@@ keys that spont@@ ane@@ ously improved .
it can be roughly 40 % to 50 % of its original power from the injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we see the cells rei@@ m@@ anti@@ le : the same A@@ ffe , two months after the irrit@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since this time we have found very much more about these cells .
we can use them and later use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s . &quot;
but our dream is still going to impl@@ ant it during the people .
I hope that I can show you how to heal the human brain the means to heal itself .

&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried the permission to start the start of clinical trials .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to start it soon ?
then one needs to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select the patient to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .

democracy . democracy .
&quot; in the West make a big mistake , it is as possible to see them as of course . &quot;
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant which she is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to see them as an un@@ constitutional state .
we believe that capitalism does not lead to democracy .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ves from Singapore and his great desc@@ endants in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy depends on us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , as I presented the newly elected government -- the newly elected government -- was not mis@@ understood that the democratic process of our country -- not to affect the austerity programs in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment I thought that there would be no better functioning for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my own friends who would tell me that the democracy would happen if they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you a economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; we have to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of China , and even the Euro@@ group of Europe , we could save our democracy , but that we need a true and rewar@@ ded democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are given our societies , our future , and our great new technologies . &quot;

but before we continue to continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the board form into the open air and the poor as a majority of the government .
&quot; the ath@@ ic democracy , of course , of course , of course . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake , the importance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to this loss . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was , and is that they were not only the right of expression , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but not only the right to freedom of expression . &quot;
the ath@@ ic democracy has not been kept long .
&quot; like a candle which is very light , it is also very light . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal Democratic Democratic Democratic Democratic Party was not in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the gl@@ ary revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ ic democracy has been concentrated on the free of citizens and the working poor , based our liberal democracy on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a that ultimately was a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came to , as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process of democratic process , while the economy of business -- a democratic zone has been a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s Democratic Democratic Republic , this separation of politics and economy started a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead of the economy . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is not at a Deg@@ ener@@ ation of their DNA .
&quot; it lies in the government , and nevertheless not to the power , because the power of politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I chosen my hair with the capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about such a herd of evil that is so long as a herd of animals that nour@@ ishes them so long as they nour@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy , which is so far too far , that it is important to invest in itself by the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of the business grows , political goods , and the managing director of the business , and the managing director of the business is too fast to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the greater the people of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; of democracy , the higher will the twin @-@ brother , and the greater the disappearance of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if it is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreigners . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; the Marxist left , this idea was about 100 years ago and it was not strange . &quot;
&quot; the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only through a miracle , as in ancient Athens , without new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working poor are creating !
capitalism does not replaced by a low wage @-@ wage employment through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin beds will be higher , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we have to re@@ unite the economy and the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we will be aware that we will appear in a disease @-@ related monitoring , otherwise we can appear in a disease @-@ related surveillance , which can appear in a disease . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , whether the technical achievements , which he has brought forth , will survive . &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether the capitalism is similar to a D@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in the machines , and people serve their energy into the research of the Universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; in long conversations with the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; what does it mean , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , rather than the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot;
&quot; in the practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please contact a capital market in which you need money , while you work out of a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you just works -- it is property of those who work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and dis@@ solve , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to companies who are not working in the company , and employees who are working there , not belong to capital and labour , no large gaps between capital and labour , no big difference between investment and savings , and ultimately no big difference between capital and savings . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : imagine , in short , that our national currencies have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest economy &#93; , in interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world is in this currency -- we call it &quot; the universe &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; universe &quot; &quot; -- and every government paid the sum that corresponds to the commercial or trading income of the country , which corresponds to a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment subsidies are . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
&quot; it is basically , what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the board of W@@ oods Conference of 1944 . &quot;
the problem was that this was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have seen them in particular before the background of a re@@ mun@@ eration policies and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I preferred to you , is a liberal party in which they preferred to be privileged , and Marxist , because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the M@@ ül@@ heim of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ as , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; but above all the other is a world , in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
are we going to wake up in such world

&quot; &quot; &quot; as a liberal Marx@@ ists , &quot; &quot; as liberal Marx@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have spoken , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is the way of doing so , the technological development will create a so massive decline of the overall economic demand , which has been called Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , it is not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is relevant , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; and as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal party , and as Key@@ nes , and I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well aware of it . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very successful , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said . BG : in your lecture , you will have very clear what you have done from the sight of the West to China . &quot;
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal Democratic Democratic , we have a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to the policies , while the field of economy is a completely democratic @-@ democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some cases , when I say that in the beginning of the 19th century , is similar to China today at the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy , -- that is a mistake , historically . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical which affects the democratic development .
&quot; what is now in China , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now have to do to do what the West in the 19th century itself has done to hypo@@ cris@@ y for hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I am sure that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you stay six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , out of personal sight , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , for we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro crisis . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say , by the self @-@ confidence , and the di@@ oc@@ eans that ran a massive reduction line through the euro , and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to put on the basis of the Greek subur@@ bs -- the way , the first suggestion , which was the first suggestion . &quot;
&quot; it is right to make it right . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the Eurozone , will continue to be elected . &quot;
but you know what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get a economic system that is not over@@ able , through political will and Auth@@ ori@@ zation of the life , it will probably be a while , but when the change occurs , he is left and destroyed . &quot;
&quot; Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Tuesday , 10 November 2009 &quot;
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
go to the top of the page Skip user information
&quot; if there is a financial minister or any Minister , who claimed for 6 months in office , in particular in such a way , he has no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I have made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
but that gave it not .
&quot; they wanted to bring out our government , only because they did not want to deal with the consequences of the euro@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astro@@ phic program in Greece . &quot;
we lost a third of our output B@@ IP .
&quot; it is worse than the &quot; &quot; Great depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one of the Tro@@ ika of the money , who has given us this policy : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ s@@ al mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all the people , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of the conversations , you seem to be right per @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro crisis comes from someone , the Europe lives and love . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro crisis is not allowed .
&quot; for if they are not , they will destroy the self @-@ being , demon@@ ic and the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this is not alone for Europe dis@@ astro@@ phic consequences , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we &apos;re probably the most powerful economy of the world .
&quot; when we begin to beat the path of a post@@ modern 1930 which it appears , it is also unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Y@@ an@@ is , thank you so that you were in TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; of Roy Price have never been heard , although he probably never heard about 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes on the decision to return the Roy before three years .
* * LINK * * Pin@@ point growth sectors and identify factors driving change ;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; on Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content on the Amazon .
of course it is a very hard drive industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy does not choose something .
he must find shows that very well .
&quot; in other words , he must find shows presently on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the website , but the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this assessment . &quot;
&quot; your show with nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then one has a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The wire &quot; -- all the shows that make your brain : &quot; &quot; where there is more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should be enough to say what at the end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not aware of the left side of the curve , because I believe it needs special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thought about the middle of the middle , the average TV -- the shows that neither are bad nor bad they are simply not bad . &quot;
so he needs to ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon will do anything so that you don &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where it can be free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if the Amazon will be out there , you will be right ? &quot;
&quot; millions of viewers watch these episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they will be able to look at this shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team at all .
&quot; by Andrzej On February 17 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show them .
&quot; in fact , the data , process , process , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it seems that no many of these show may remember that they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only a average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is the average of these curve 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ ders at 7,5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team . &quot;
&quot; Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of a competition , he and his team know the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews which shows them , which shows them , etc . &quot;
take advantage of this information to find these little details about the spectators : what shows they like to show what are the actor .
&quot; as they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four transmitter , but a drama series about a bit . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit at least for the first two staff . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question : what is this happened ? &quot;

&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; for the logic , it should be said that it should work for all . &quot;

&quot; what can you expect , is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is something special because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to meet serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;
does anyone know the company multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no . ok that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one will ever come in touch with this software .
&quot; if anyone here in the USA in prison and in order to specify it , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ agreement is done or not . &quot;
&quot; but instead of Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; but even more years in prison are worse , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;

&quot; it worked fine , year to a year until it suddenly wasn &apos;t worked , &quot;

&quot; in spite of all this errors , data acquisition is a -- at the workplace , in the legal position , in the medicine . &quot;
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- one area , with some very smart people to meet serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy . &quot;
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be used .
&quot; do you need to solve a complex problem , do you do with two things : &quot;
&quot; in order to analyze this problem , so that you can analyze the details ; as a second set , you will be back together to make a withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and again . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
they are not suitable to cut parts together again and then enter a withdrawal .
there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good , it is good parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , then if the brain is not complete when it &apos;s the brain of a experts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; you can use data to understand their audience , what they would not have been able to understand . but the decision to take all these parts , and that a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; makes it not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that they were a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon are based on the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as it &apos;s around TV ideas , then as they called &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it led not to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I think that things goes wrong if you start to control our decisions .
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool and not to forget that device is quite useful . &quot;
your email address will not be published . required fields are marked *
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it will also be called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a single or No @-@ question , you only need to get the ball to get a answer . &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; &quot; -- just here in this moment . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I have seen some decisions in my life where I would have to hear about the ball .
&quot; but , as you know of course , you want to replace the data you would like to replace these by something a lot of compensation , such as data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in this way , it will probably be able to meet decisions when we want to meet some extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I find this as a very encouraging message that it is still to be able to meet decisions in spite of the great amount of data , and to make decisions to be a expert in which you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because at the end there are not the data , but the risks associated with which you can run at the right side of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
