<seg id="1106">"in spite of all this errors, data acquisition is a -- at the workplace, in the legal position, in the medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- one area, with some very smart people to meet serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"do you need to solve a complex problem, do you do with two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"in order to analyze this problem, so that you can analyze the details; as a second set, you will be back together to make a withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?"</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to cut parts together again and then enter a withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good, it is good parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, then if the brain is not complete when it's the brain of a experts."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe I was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you can use data to understand their audience, what they would not have been able to understand. but the decision to take all these parts, and that a show as" House of Cards "makes it not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that they were a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon are based on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as it's around TV ideas, then as they called" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It led not to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I think that things goes wrong if you start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool and not to forget that device is quite useful."</seg>

<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>

<seg id="1132">I have seen some decisions in my life where I would have to hear about the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, you want to replace the data you would like to replace these by something a lot of compensation, such as data analysis, to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in this way, it will probably be able to meet decisions when we want to meet some extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I find this as a very encouraging message that it is still to be able to meet decisions in spite of the great amount of data, and to make decisions to be a expert in which you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end there are not the data, but the risks associated with which you can run at the right side of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
