&quot; the large picture postcard were used for cities and congregations of detailed maps , so called Ur@@ bino . &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the notes of the Bayerische Vereins@@ bank , between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and the first de@@ position of the Bay@@ reuth Festival . &quot;
client : Napoleon .
&quot; the French Heer@@ es@@ ian leader had occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War , with Austria . &quot;
&quot; Napoleon knows an overview of the occupied country , and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria &apos;s order - of course , of course , of course . &quot;
&quot; even if the French troops took place with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighb@@ ors that were the idea of a surface area of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic coverage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Scope &quot; &quot; was founded . &quot;
the urine sheet for Munich dates back from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; compared to the other hand , the capital of the capital is the most part of the capital . &quot;
the city has extended into all directions .
an example of this is the send@@ ling which is relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; on the map of the map , in 18@@ 77 , the Munich district was established in 18@@ 77 . &quot;
today is the send@@ ling in the midst of the city .
&quot; in 18@@ 56 , the houses were built in 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named 18@@ 78 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian State of the Bavarian State of Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - on the first glance : in the view of the first glance : in writing and numbers : hand in writing , made from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ination &quot; , &quot; from which the basic tax has been removed . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers for farmers , but small farmers have no more than farmers , but small farmers of the plant in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; in the 19th century , Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz in the 19th century , in the 19th century , there was still a grass and no concrete . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or by the height &quot; &quot; on the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ halle , was established in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was advanced for his time and immediately after , for example the reason of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he taught the staff to apply violence against the workers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , first place was extended , later on 500 seats was extended . &quot;
&quot; some also , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ aissance in hair 1905 . &quot;

now the White House of Tr@@ ump is the Statue of Liberty .
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to begin with the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the sor@@ ption of the cr@@ um@@ ble Sad@@ dam H@@ uss@@ one on the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did , when he did a symbolic A@@ xt in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; to stay at fair , Miller is not the statue itself . &quot;
&quot; a hormone of bo@@ ilers and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have been made him , when he had done it . &quot;
&quot; but he asked their meaning , and especially the meaning that you was written as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the thought of thought . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta j@@ im@@ ed : &quot; I will not want to enter a complete list of history , but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that inhab@@ it the world . &quot;
the poem which you want to refer to which later has been added and not part of the original Liberty .
Miller Miller is the right choice but it &apos;s not really a story about history .
&quot; it goes around the contemporary steps of Laz@@ arus , the only one , in which a state does not only accept any of the poor , but the sleeves of the arms : &quot; your fatigue , your arms , and thy poor masses , who were to breathe for free to breathe for free to breathe for free . &quot;
there was never a time in which the waste waste can be better to see on our screens .
Miller is not welcome in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome .
this conflict between the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict to the importance of the meaning .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who want to place their words according to their death .
the sculpture should show the connections between the French and American Republi@@ can show by placing them in an un@@ used classical representation of the female int@@ ric@@ ate of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in their poem is the female figure not more abstract - it has a voice .
&quot; and she gives himself an entirely different names , mother of ex@@ il@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the connection of the ge@@ dness with the image is a brilliant fem@@ inists , and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m . &quot;
&quot; and exactly like Laz@@ arus the significance of the statue changed , the people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great read more than R@@ ush Lim@@ esc@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist church , argue that the Statue of Liberty has changed the American flame , but rather a early neo@@ conservative , which is the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
it shall also be the same as the law of the United States in the rest of the world .

quite unusual is Lim@@ ous@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is completely and a question of the perception of perception .
&quot; indeed , Laz@@ arus was able to see how they had seen from the numbered , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible travel on the de@@ ks of ships . &quot;
it is the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will to hear them .
and this is of course not the perspective of the Miller and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; her hair is not the way of enlighten@@ ed , but the hatred of power is the only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black Mobile members of the teams from Great Britain
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminded by a time , as only two bands for the team of Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; the performance Director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member states have a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of sch@@ ot@@ ene athlete was chosen for London 2017 , which starts at Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believe that &quot; &quot; being developed in Scotland &apos;s something special &quot; &quot; and the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something . &quot;
&quot; we welcome you and we are trying to understand and we will continue it until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
I speak with people in a Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has done something with what they did .
the sch@@ ental athletes think that it has done something with what they did .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; what is the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the sch@@ illing athletes are med@@ als with med@@ als , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ t and Andrew But@@ t on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team . &quot;
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
your chapter &apos;s speech was unbeliev@@ able , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were so@@ ot@@ table or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and true feeling , the E@@ ili@@ d@@ h was entirely of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alli@@ sts , which is awarded with its fifth world champ@@ ionships . &quot;
the best total number of athletes arrived at the World Championship was seven years of 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; the middle @-@ axis of Mu@@ ir leads to this way , and has set five British and two European records . &quot;
&quot; they will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m away . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another shame that you should see the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminds of their first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Sch@@ eme in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the Mann@@ ish @-@ capitalist says that they are very proud of the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only for team , but in some cases even in the med@@ als and with the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is a great honor to know that it was a great honor to know that my team is able to have a great honor to know that my team has chosen me for me , &quot; she added some very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the bags that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came to .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to go on the podium . &quot;
what is my speech as a chapter ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I only say that we have very happy that we have very happy in this situation because we have a home world .
&quot; so , it &apos;s really important to set up this home support and benefit from that we are again in the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will be just a great atmosphere in outside . &quot;

&quot; the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of the governor as fri@@ ghtened , and the online review was full of a counter@@ f@@ eit with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it &apos;s important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ ogan .
&quot; this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the consent of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the nation .
there is no reac@@ tionary heat .
he has a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict compliance of the principles .
&quot; it was also very easy to use Facebook as a pri@@ mer means to connect with his voters , and use his ha@@ ar@@ er head to chemotherapy on his site . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ers of individuals who come on the side of the governor - the public forum is known as officially called for employees who paid with public tax @-@ dollars . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Watch H@@ og@@ ans announced the acts of the governor , and argue that the block@@ ades of the comments nothing further than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of Tro@@ ut or Sp@@ aces or water @-@ filled people who use the P@@ eit@@ ch . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ ogan .
&quot; and that &apos;s only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a parish , no consol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; they said , they said that their comments are full of attention and not satisfied . &quot;
the parish church in his post and app@@ el@@ ated to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
&quot; Attorney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi S@@ arma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ as , MD . , was not h@@ ass@@ ent , but she asked to Hass@@ el . &quot;
&quot; I decided that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ elt and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the comments section of the news &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the same time , this idea is not to be recognized as a number of people at the same time , they will be recognized as a so @-@ called collective action and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors , as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; would like to name other likely &quot; &quot; language &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era is simple to cut a message , using just a critic blocked or a negative comments . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in the early time when you have done the same , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines and burn them to silence . &quot;
but exactly that happens just digit@@ ally .

&quot; for him , a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder to the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong was never corrected . &quot;

the governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the Party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Friday evening at a customer service with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the Dem@@ ok@@ ment have been removed from me , &quot; said Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ think ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will change my registration to the Republi@@ can change , &quot; &quot; Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said before a big announcement at West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not take the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who has been elected by For@@ bes the only milli@@ ard@@ ant in the state , 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes presents that he has made carbon in five states , and from his father &apos;s father . &quot;
he is about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Friday evening was a statement , in which it said : &quot; the party changes from Gover@@ nor Justice , is another blow for a Democratic Party who would rather go to work in order to make our country again . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Justice is only the final result of a party which is from above to below without leadership and not able to find a positive attitude towards the &quot; &quot; R@@ NC @-@ president &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ hin m@@ c@@ d@@ aniel in a statement to the CB@@ S News . &quot;

&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ y@@ la@@ kh@@ tin said , during the IA@@ AF congress at the front of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the name of his country was correct and that he has decided to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said he was sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , which were numbered of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments on the IA@@ AF Congress for the excitement of the prohibition , that in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) will be found in Russia after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ AD@@ A ) . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; IA@@ AF President Co@@ e has the rep@@ lication . &quot;
the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced that they have experienced some pretty hot times and everything worked to ensure that the Federation is newly designed .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again . &quot;
we need to do everything in order to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the ver@@ dict system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nine months Russian athletes will start with the Athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutr@@ alized actors . &quot;

&quot; the steel frame is rather complicated , &quot; explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so arranged so that they had to come up with each other .
it wasn &apos;t just about to build a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had to stand for the function above or below the right height .
this arrangement allowed the fan to place two rooms in full height with a lot of additional drama .
the frame looks like a classic copper windows of re@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ am@@ our@@ able living area .

&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family @-@ operation , but a sharp decline over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brethren 38 Properties in the value of more than one billion dollar , including the family of 1973 a business in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the West@@ co jeans founded the family West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 individual retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , and shopping centres in the subur@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her father , Colin and Paul was described by Paul as a &quot; main office and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis , about two thirds of the company and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; it means that it means that in the value of 316 million dollars , and Paul entered the value of 176 million dollars . &quot;

&quot; the brothers are going to fight against control over the existing business , of Colin , as Paul claimed to have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not true , but it is not true , but does Paul before , some owners in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early kinder@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says , he wants to call the dispute . &quot;

&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the new part of the White House plans to limit the information flow on President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform level . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new part of the White House of the White House , he received a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ aben @-@ white house that he will repair all the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff , that information about him should , whether on paper or in letters - because of the President of better decisions , if he would be good information . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to use , but it &apos;s not easy to use , but it &apos;s not easy to use it . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ aben &apos;s relationship on television is back - and now , where he is still in the White House , is his television advertising still . &quot;
&quot; when the candidate Tr@@ ump due to an un@@ fair reporting was productive , it was productive to convince him to convince him to convince him to convince him that he was a fair reporting of jobs that was to convince him that he was a fair reporting of jobs , said the former election was Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ unk Twitter habits under control , according to the six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media is a ste@@ aling price . &quot;
okay By@@ ee@@ e@@ ee Su@@ i@@ Princess
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ aben &apos;s habits have ever heard &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is smiling . &quot;
perhaps these Kamp@@ agn@@ es are something that we cannot know - that Tr@@ ash Twe@@ ets without their interventions nor more ignition .
we &apos;ll probably never find something about the Twe@@ ets who has not sent the Tr@@ ump .
&quot; if his staff had already heard some times , the anger of him , then have their efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has consistently uph@@ eld , that Tr@@ ump will be driven out . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that the people in a White House that encourages men in a White House , and again try to present their own agenda by using Tr@@ ump material , which may lead to their own views from the world . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - entirely with this history - told in May about the coun@@ selling advis@@ ors , the president of strategic reasons . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump members say that Tr@@ ump like a volcan@@ o to negative events can react , especially those with damage L@@ ooks , and that he can find out where it is from this date . &quot;
&quot; exactly what happened to the end of February , when someone wants to be a printed copy of a article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who gave the Deputy Head of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of L@@ ots &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was a member of Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he has no concrete evidence . &quot;
&quot; once again , Tr@@ ump decided to ask more to read more about Wal@@ sh server . &quot;

&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still more pulse of self , and his consultants are still under influence . &quot;

&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is deep , although its presence everywhere is present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle finger with the word &quot; &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; which is in the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two reporter in the three years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;

&quot; in 2010 , an interview was created by journalists in order to edit cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as in most of thousands of Mor@@ den , each year with drug trade and organic crime are linked by journalists only rarely seen in court . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , it is still waiting to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ unc@@ lean , and even though the terrain is still hidden . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very easy to use my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know what we know , mis@@ str@@ ust we all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez was the office of the Zeitung Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the city of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he was forced to drive a few blocks too far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was forced by two men . he was forced by his car , probably due to his car , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which with &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; river . &quot;
&quot; in his car away , and damaged it near . &quot;
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
the rum@@ ors of the rum@@ ors are in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an freely um@@ ber@@ ed .
&quot; but on Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans inj@@ unc@@ tions in the United States and the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the most powerful batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since riv@@ alled frac@@ tions are to fight to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the street , or that the cemetery is full of ench@@ anted , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ ades for drug royal , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; if only one is a bed that has a state of &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; if only one is a Kartell designed by the cows and drugs trade in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , which he could not make his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings are contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the most riv@@ alled cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children . &quot;
this publication may be sent to the children of the children of each copy of each copy of the issue as soon as they were sent to the newspaper .
&quot; the second error was in the Val@@ dez to force to force to force another newspaper , the same history was released to leave the country to his own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his pots is as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
&quot; he had so long , that his friends and colleagues do so that he would always be there . &quot;

&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; was it impossible to discuss journ@@ alism without causing the noise problem . &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper has earned a reputation because of the brave and honest reporting , and the revenues and the advertising . &quot;
&quot; reporter asked it , hard to publish articles without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the reader were read by a publication , where they could read stories that no one else would treat them . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee to protect journalists from the persecution of Mexican drug history , where they always led them . &quot;
he gave no fear that he had fear .
&quot; I would like to live , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Team miss Val@@ dez , the fun of fun , like a port workers , the friend , the gener@@ als and rats , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
confidential to his routine .
he would love to wear his hat .
&quot; he would always come to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , go and there is always at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for the routine ?
&quot; his death also gave them to the question of how they do their work in question , as they do their work on the best , and will remain in life . &quot;
&quot; they do not like to move with their women , their children , their clean@@ ers , their back starting point and run@@ way , to move to drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ confidence and self @-@ confidence . &quot;
to trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
&quot; if it is wrong , keep it away . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be done ... and then is the thing with J@@ avier happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ stri@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ates , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space , in which the employees met from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to the security training , we were not allowed to use it . days ago , the Spy@@ ware that will be sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
there were also two polic@@ emen in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a building .
they were not to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a middle class quarter of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; on the other hand , some of the reporter asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , the governor itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the reporter went to the Ber@@ gl@@ ar , where the drug prov@@ oked a fac@@ to under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce is on three main stories . &quot;
there was the murder of the brother of the former known pit Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; we also had a fantastic panorama to the state , which was concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there were a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the coup . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about it , or how it came to write , that it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally locally of drugs and authorities . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who was the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which is almost the whole century all political planes . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I Gover@@ nor were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; this entry was posted in David Axe , English . &quot;
&quot; just few months ago , the reader of Val@@ dez was the best known source of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; before we had already seen what happens , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the first name &quot; El FLA@@ CO &quot; because of his slender body work . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sticker that has been dedicated to the mor@@ ale of journalists , because the employees had never been expected that they had never expected . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , a few characters and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the office of the state . &quot;
&quot; two days after Val@@ dez killed three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the Western State Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a verb@@ al body was discovered and official , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; in all the country , journalists have become more stronger by taking them organized in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on the way and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez walk away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the Justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez said the authorities , journalists and they bring it to the truth because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , it has been asked to enter the government once again , because it is concerned that their anger is wounded . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had said that journalists in Mexico from organic crime , the government officials and of a constant society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; , he wrote that reporter &apos;s not to be killed , but also on the command of politicians and security forces connected with the organized crime among a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year more than half of the attacks on journalists , journalists and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you know because they would like to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , Mor@@ de is obviously a terrible effect . &quot;
no one thought about the death of the Blog@@ gers Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ stri@@ as before six years .
&quot; your body was found together with a note , the allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kartell was signed . &quot;

&quot; some journalists have fled from their home states , or even from the country . &quot;
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in the ex@@ ile , and watch it still the streets and seek risks . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are reli@@ eved , as there is obviously the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico , three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ik@@ or@@ ating decisions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and that &apos;s why I was asked , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors had already finished the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the office and tran@@ ken beer , when all of her Telef@@ one began to sum@@ med . &quot;
&quot; a number of li@@ que@@ ens with band@@ logo and security forces in the bathing place of Maz@@ at@@ lan , 19 confirmed dead . &quot;
the war broke down as it was promised by a series of Kartell by Kartell in the region .
&quot; from the board stone , they have the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about mobile phone . &quot;
the introduction had to be changed at the next day .
&quot; in the vicinity cant@@ een , near the centre of the village . &quot;
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a view of the polic@@ emen to see the guard in order to see whether they were in their willingness .
&quot; if they were at all , they were not afraid . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce his tracks . &quot;
&quot; as you can only think of thinking , Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day he was murdered , asked me to send her to the reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used Tar@@ get@@ to to make his enemies .
&quot; on the first look , it looks like a statue if even an out@@ stretched . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers found that the first @-@ findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain@@ eering were so good that experts have been described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa &apos;s Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that it was so good that it was so good that his trousers skin of r@@ öt@@ sch was - and they said , they could have something of a &quot; un@@ peaceful past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report published in the magazine &quot; Current Affairs &quot; showed him as &quot; the be@@ ekeeping din@@ os@@ aur , which ever was found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur items of the world . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ossi@@ l is a new discovered type of No@@ dos@@ ages , which lived in the middle of the circular period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ balanced state , researchers , that it is as &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ ored plant eat the best in its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or , Mine at Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , to the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met a little bit of the surrounding rocks , and decided to see more precise . &quot;
from him discovered F@@ ossi@@ l was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years , the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth . &quot;
&quot; according to all these hard work , the finished result is ready to be closed . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to believe only a little with the eyes of blind , you might want to believe that it has gone , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creation is to see . &quot;
&quot; as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur items , the mon@@ a Lisa &apos;s Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers found out that this plant @-@ eat @-@ eat , although he is covered with a arm@@ oured tank , probably due to meat @-@ eating din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong @-@ arm@@ ored din@@ os@@ aur used a red and white Tar@@ ga to hide from heart , and used a par@@ agli@@ der technology that is known as counter@@ sunk . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix up better in its surroundings , and to say about experts what it suggests that it was threatened by major din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
&quot; the 110 million years old , from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , has taken part in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ at@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; researchers have now called the wild animal , and it is called B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta to the museum @-@ techni@@ cian Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ 0,000 hours . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and shape of pol@@ ymers and arm@@ ament over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the con@@ junc@@ tiv@@ ist , a common defence method in animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the cre@@ atively dark@@ er was dark@@ er than their base . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ quer@@ ors are common , the results are surprising , as the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far away the living animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of enough pressure through meat eat din@@ os@@ aur , that the evolution of evolution as a means of over@@ life . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals who use the con@@ gest@@ ure - think of R@@ ey , Zeb@@ ras or hip animals - are a lot of smaller and vulnerable as prey , which sign@@ alled that this No@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to survival . &quot;
&quot; even from the beginning of the world , the world &apos;s most famous Din@@ os@@ au@@ rs will show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs dies from the circular time , said Brown . &quot;
no Events were found with the defined settings Biwak # 17 : wild Food
scientists also investigate the animal of hints about his life in order to figure out what it did as its last meal .
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur , when he died , in a river , where he was driven on the back to the sea side . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was so warm like southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans probably probably more cru@@ el than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because he is fully covered with con@@ dens@@ ate skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of animal re@@ tains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today is nearly as looks like in the early circular season .
&quot; you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it is . &quot;
&quot; the circular time was a time when the huge Ther@@ mop@@ odes , meat @-@ eating din@@ os@@ au@@ tic , which stood on two legs . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ som@@ au@@ rus Re@@ x , million years after B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was the arm@@ ored din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ au@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of hard monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest insights into the journal of Biology , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta after death in the sea , and in the slu@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn , when he was arrested on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or , Mine at Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , to the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the most durable din@@ os@@ aur in the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely removed from Schn@@ au@@ ze until the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 metres ) and have up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which are made by the shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the arm@@ ored plant eat of the Western Canada weak@@ ened by the Western Canada , until a over@@ hau@@ led river into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater massage of the din@@ os@@ aur separates his arm@@ rests in exquisite item detail .

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s yes , &quot; &quot; thought &quot; &quot; thought . &quot;
but the death was for them and their fel@@ lowship nothing new .
if you want to return your mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive will return to the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who said to be a shield with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have killed my un@@ armed Son ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they have a live support in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a b@@ ell@@ ant dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common . &quot; &quot; this is not usual . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder which we have used for us and that we can see typical .
in this moment I felt our bulk material .
I was angry and we@@ pt .
at the next day we went home to the next day at home .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two at the next morning after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on would pass . &quot;
&quot; in the following three years , Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on passive , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the cinema starting from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of over@@ life and Protest@@ ant , the love and the losses , the strength and resistance is filled from the point of people who live in the community and the streets are filled to ask answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , a flower @-@ dress , and a matching crown , the two one conversation , which they had countless times before the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; just imagine how I have given you , when black people have to fight for the fight , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered that what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that didn &apos;t work correctly . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a high peak of what happened in the past .
you need to know and see it in it .
&quot; you have to be well developed , not only stock and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have luck , you have experience a experience in which they personally experience personally identi@@ fiable rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove their bad service to keep them . &quot;
&quot; the first station as she was in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was found at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place against the police , which was at a Camp@@ bell , as the activists on the possible non @-@ indict@@ ment of the Vienna &apos;s courts . &quot;
&quot; there are Fer@@ rell and her daughter with a local business , lunch . &quot;
they made bags before and hal@@ ted them on the demonstr@@ ator .
&quot; slowly , a new type of stock is returned for Fer@@ rell . &quot;
&quot; since the 9th August total , she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; said that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Association , and was concentrated on Es@@ ther justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches . &quot;
I had no experience in the organisation .
it &apos;s all about .
&quot; later , Fer@@ rell died during a evening demonstration in Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , &quot; &quot; Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to the sense : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these Sk@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of White - in a community that pro@@ hibits from their pain and its resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and brought up their voices , and we wanted to make it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already been working together with the later co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the field , which is known for its de@@ vis@@ m rum . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to the project , together with six other people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browser . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us , or with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it comes from movement &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it was a community who comes together in the film , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it was the most obvious of the participants in the film . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose goes without saying &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; a personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , how she married to her and her wife married . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked &quot; , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , as they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that it has to be done in this work and in the human being of black people , to give a certain level of damage . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history represents the role of black sw@@ ings women in the wider black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founder of the movement , who have created the black teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in social media are identified as sul@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have been carried out in the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women must be the main last load of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement is really a black women and many black women .
&quot; it is , however , that &quot; this is not a natural type of action &quot; , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell due to her identity as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person responsible for this energy , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no accident , although she was at the front , because in a life of these cru@@ ises than a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the news breaks in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on long gone , but the rac@@ ist links between the municipality and the police are still continue to continue . &quot;
Fer@@ rell sticks for 2 ½ years due to the block of a demonstration in a demonstration .
&quot; she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that they called their home , &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and she feels like a song and she feels obliged , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the street . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .

&quot; in front of all , the small market conditions in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;

of which there are enough space in our city .
&quot; it looks like many shop shops here , for some months and years . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is the more important that at least the brand shares will remain . &quot;
&quot; the product segments discussed in this data report include : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Consumer Health market ; * Pin@@ point growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; as you see , retail shops will be rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , because the dor@@ mit@@ es are often not portable for a single company . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what it is still remains , then it will disappear again . &quot;
Wolf F@@ ight : &quot; a shopping cart with a brand portfolio fits for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where are the farm@@ houses during the construction time ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration , when the bit gallery is actually happening . &quot;

George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping centre , which is empty , does not need no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery . &quot;

an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings
&quot; in the middle of the room of the FRI@@ D@@ MAN Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost unbe@@ atable - the cab@@ ling of the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ers and Hair@@ styles which were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old boy@@ cott of the prison in Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth where the former intelligence analysts had made a 35 @-@ year @-@ year imprisonment after they made known for diplomatic messages on the website http : / / www.g@@ fb@@ v.@@ it / 2@@ c @-@ st@@ ampa / 2006 / 05 / 030@@ 6@@ 55@@ 5@@ .html &gt; was successfully checked as XHTML 1.0 Strict .
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is A B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ em@@ ari@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline have been converted into technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ gres@@ sion and murder , who had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ ar was created by the algorithms of the DNA that could look like this genom@@ ic data , as someone with this genom@@ ic data could not only be interpreted to the For@@ mb@@ ark@@ en of DNA data - the many wise men , as they can be interpreted and the tough@@ est determin@@ ism of this interpretation - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward born , but already since its Pu@@ ber@@ ty has been openly about the identification as a woman , including six ver@@ aging against the spy Law , computer science , and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her picture gave her picture , so much that it was only a single photo , a gra@@ dient , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which the m@@ anning is probably on a driver &apos;s seat , and a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which it was associated with it . &quot;

in this produced the artist portraits from the for@@ en@@ ian art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette numbers and ch@@ anting in order to produce the DNA from the garb@@ age to create a picture of which people could look like this people .
that was the time where she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they performed a interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and they could not visit this time , and they could not be asked to make contact with Chelsea and asked her to make them a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her in@@ gest@@ ed M@@ use were given to three dig@@ its , which gave several letters into the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they want to see one of Sho@@ cks Kan@@ ung@@ o also illustrated images , which would like to convert a future , in which President Chel@@ ated , and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama has only a few days , after the book was published after seven brutal years in a military prison , a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there are also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and powerful , as Donald Tr@@ ump has a war against In@@ dependence from the government camp and against Trans@@ nation@@ alism , to find new , digi@@ tization sched@@ ules , which actually should fix the star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things out of a certain reason happen . &quot;
&quot; in one of the Gallery of the Gallery , the artist called M@@ anning with their over@@ sh@@ old signature among them ( which &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart , whose foundation of gender , breed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the front wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ ale DNA sequ@@ ential - a thousands of vibrations of Cs and G@@ s and As , in pencil , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , represented by the involvement of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ides after the highly developed scientific institute of the artist ) , such as amazing , at least in biological respect , we all are . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why people could say that our Gen@@ ome didn &apos;t care , who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and such as subjective , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ ar , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to see . &quot;
DNA data can tell a lot of different stories that are more than 30 of these stories .
the last piece in the exhibition which is placed in one &apos;s own room is a page of the above mentioned comic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le .
&quot; it shows M@@ anning , as they are in the hand of the east of the United States , such as king @-@ Middle East . &quot;
&quot; when they set your speech in cold , they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she has written me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , the artist , made from Philadelphia . &quot;

&quot; the exhibition is not personally ever seen - so as it should be seen in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , it will be greeted by their own genom@@ ic simulation , which is like Hor@@ ses by Prot@@ esti@@ bu@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; this was also true , as everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which their gene@@ alogy of H@@ ap@@ log@@ gia were written . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human quantity , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ ar from the portrait . &quot;
&quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea , as the movement that is also behind their liberation . &quot;

some have their tri@@ ght parts and show the back of sweat of the first day of the training camp .

&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A , two @-@ days exercises to simplify the burden of the player , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finale on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training of U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 a.m. to start the player already fully @-@ packed time zones of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , at the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the summer school and during the summer school for the first time during the summer school . &quot;
you should hold in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal action plan for its rise against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he is the control of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add the opportunity to add a further point of the player . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous loads of three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they saw it simply , they are pressed , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we have come to Saturday and we have more time , it is really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , what the camp is finished by the clear majority of its fields and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the built class , which has already been disc@@ arded by foot . &quot;
&quot; the hotel will be the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial , that it might be a problem , as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a true problem , and it &apos;s not far too much to think that people will rent there a room and then set up a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video of video , it &apos;s a fairly good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;

&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; &apos; A Castle in England &apos; from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , coming British artists , Bri@@ ghton May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on a Archive : it wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that he was un@@ expect@@ edly asked . &quot;
&quot; I have written on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double ag@@ itation in the 1700 years , who worked for the Jak@@ ob@@ iner , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb pressure ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and letters smell always after smoke , because at that time there is a fire of light because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as would it be even more . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who lived with old pap@@ a , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council , and almost four months in a castle . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the historical &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and the many treasures of the Castle of the Castle and the bottles to study the centuries in the Gr@@ aben . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and said with Land@@ lords , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes even with the artists who were working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; at night , at night , &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust has received the full access to the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as a Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he said than &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oph@@ are said , &quot; Oh , don &apos;t know it on the roof . &quot;
&quot; books , books from the time of the German Emp@@ athy , maps that would show what they did , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but it was a pe@@ ke to have two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection , use the castle as a starting point to begin on wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who built a man who built the newly built Castle , to close the farm@@ land of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there are a record of an open @-@ party , the 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kne@@ e of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area and I thought , an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are present at the history of the Castle of the Castle , as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of Jes@@ u@@ it , who tells the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the German Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the Or@@ g@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell sticks out of the 18th century , which was made with stones ( a discovery that was recorded in the first year later , when his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men &apos;s stor@@ ms seemed to be able to make money and money for things that they didn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men par@@ ked their school crises , by taking them rich old women - I want to me as a bunch of great guys before , with a talent in order to gain access . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his application , Rho@@ des is on the search for another unique introduc@@ tions &quot;
&quot; he has a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic @-@ Roman about El@@ em@@ igration from the early 20th century , since then in the early 20th century , since then in the early 20th century . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready to be ready again . &quot;

&quot; the rise of sex robot is real , and we should not worry about us . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are a big thing .
&quot; recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years , in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ eri@@ alized professor for robots and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to begin to take their Ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of nail . &quot;
&quot; the people make it funny but the companies deliver every lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently to see , &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o have developed their powerful partners with a silicone skin which is warm to be warm - with conscious human reactions to be achieved through the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot as well as in accordance with its beliefs , as well as everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the chest , to the type or color of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still very calm , since many robots are the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; , which would be a step@@ ford woman . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o have developed the robot with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties that they want to find them how to install them .
&quot; and then there is still the true comp@@ lexi@@ ble Ro@@ xx@@ x.@@ Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; the impression of how &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; , &quot; the impression of an adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality that is easily adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot;
&quot; may you like what you like , and don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it has also its endeav@@ ors - very like real people ! &quot;
&quot; you can be tired , which may be fixed or it can be &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this Ascen@@ sion of sex robot - not least because they are real human relationships - but the underground female properties , which can be seen on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , be@@ au@@ ght one of most . &quot;
&quot; in a few minutes , a few days later . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots not only a fe@@ eder or for just another kind of sho@@ oter . &quot;
&quot; her teeth and her increasing sophistic@@ ation to a bit of Dun@@ kl@@ eres and Ti@@ es in our culture , based on a return of the gender equality in our culture , on a desire for sex with under@@ tak@@ ings as optional . &quot;
&quot; most men will do not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R will remain their increasing popularity , they remain temporary on the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is out of the boundary zones , it can live in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are no strange , or offensive , to them the free market for the permission . &quot;
&quot; however , there are a certain risk that these highly developed sex robots in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened , in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House of the White House . &quot;
the most important aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images that has been forced into a smooth body and the is@@ och@@ us eyes but as realistic this vision .
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a jump , but the moment does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal of this sex robot is to create a physical condition for real women such as technically possible ( if there is free choice propor@@ tions ) .
their builders want to feel human beings that they make the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point when it goes around their &quot; &quot; personalities , the robot is no real women . &quot;
they can &apos;t go from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; you have no communication or background history , nothing that could affect independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of the imagination . &quot;

&quot; in this way , the power cord is less than a long way to bring families together . &quot;
&quot; I mentioned this because my c@@ ousin , a lin@@ ks@@ in who lives in Chicago , and has been busy with the republi@@ can in our family , I visited New York . &quot;
&quot; however , I think that the unity is against a common enemy can have a mighty effect . &quot;
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can transformation , suddenly , suddenly , and all over the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it falls me into another context that this is also significant risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the ent@@ angled effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push ourselves to the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ assy way that we don &apos;t have to go out of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a still possible long @-@ term country scenario , in the Tr@@ ump republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; &quot; which appear to appear in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find it nowadays from an active No@@ stal@@ gie for Mit@@ t Rom@@ mel , the dog on the Auto@@ roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax ev@@ asion ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump ? &quot;
if Tr@@ ump goes to qualify the next candidate of the republi@@ can only mental health to qualify as undes@@ irable improvement .
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the town was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ avan park in the New York Park , and the best three dollars , which can be seen in the city if you don &apos;t need c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are sc@@ ur@@ ns and the animals are turning to look great about her own shoulders - very fin@@ ster and the climatic per@@ taining music . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not work . &quot;
&quot; five and thirty years later , and I am still not quite aware of the day when I found out that Swiss Apartment is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage - but a large round@@ about in the North Lon@@ d@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ ade is still a strange experience , as here two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ moon and two women in the 40 @-@ age years , and all of them have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I would be able to rate the carousel , I would have been given to the full score but for luck , nobody has to be asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could stop my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option that comes with a 15 % reduction - this to buy something about the load table . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a slow@@ ing of what is a neutral exchange , but also print pressure on the server to make personality in a situation , in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the merchants stood guard , while I made the experience they made my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; meat products , dairy products and chocolate could help to lin@@ de IB@@ D ( inflammation of the det@@ on@@ ment ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can be sound like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study conducted exactly the contrary : a diet , which is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could the symptoms of patients with inflam@@ matory anti@@ bodies . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , around 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300@@ .000 jobs , causes stomach ulc@@ ers and blood accidents , weight loss , weight loss , loss loss , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , people are not able to avoid meat and dairy products , researchers found at the Washington University , that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop a toler@@ ant disease . &quot;
&quot; researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that are able to hide in food , not in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of reducing the inflammation of the cells , the tolerance and protect the body , without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is far towards inflammation , it may result in an anti @-@ inflam@@ matory effect . &quot;
experiments in experiments was found that a kind of tolerance of tolerance of the immune cell in mice is common to carry a particular bacterial infection .
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins in order to get the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial infection - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ il@@ lus and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the M@@ ice in their food , the more they had them from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he sm@@ ote the combination of L. Sh@@ ter@@ i and an an Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ate , less inflam@@ matory intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes Bar@@ ra@@ ffe has developed a kind of immun@@ ity that has been promoted to tolerance when she found out that a group of study such cells had to be separated , but the other group was separated . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oms of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually life in stomach ulc@@ er @-@ tra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; the dem@@ ons of the mice have been found DNA sequ@@ ential and it were found six bacterial types that were in mice with the immune cells , but without them in the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice have been removed in a ster@@ il@@ en environment , so that they were not developing a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they had been developed this kind of immune cells not developed , and they received the L. Man@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria is based on the immune system , the researchers said L. Sh@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and led little quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate cells .
&quot; as the active component from the liquid was clean@@ sed , it was known as a side @-@ product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ aboli@@ sm that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers discover the quantity of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , the number of such cells were killed by about 50 percent , but when the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ese values had half the number of cells in order to half the half of the cells . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ ffe explained that people use the same toler@@ ant cells such as M@@ ice , and that most of us L. says . &quot;
&quot; it is not known that Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. is developing to develop humans such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , were found with anti @-@ inflam@@ matory drugs . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to support these cells to control the inner surface of the dar@@ ms . &quot;
potential can lead high Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ al values in the presence of L. Sh@@ ter@@ i to an increase of this population .

a trade union would like to make a trade union at Man@@ age of Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie about the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company have been trained across the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ er site . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the work , next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea glasses . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owners Pla@@ dis said he had invested more than 5 million pounds .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be first know if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s request , concerns the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Managers Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win from General Site manager no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ ern , it concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have been working on the local community and the large power of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social affairs . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage labor and prosperity , and before the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing life of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing life of the production costs , the east end of Glasgow , a flor@@ escent production line by Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ er said , &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ o has received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond to the continuous commitment to employees and trade unions . &quot;
&quot; we had two months ago a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ ern , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the staff that we do , as all companies that are in an extremely competitive and un@@ reliable business climate , our business processes continue to remain competitive - and that is valid for all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in the last years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operative improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ er as a production hall and completely at all . if our operating system will change the staff , the employees and their union representatives will be able to learn this . &quot;

the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were created between 1945 and at the beginning of the 1990s , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sex@@ ually . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it was just a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other stakeholders , many victims of the general humanity are estimated and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; in other words , he also appears as a Ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection@@ ist , which brought up to the Ö@@ f@@ 1918 . &quot;
how do you consider this report report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the effort and the whole of 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in this case . &quot;
&quot; it is just eight pages dedicated to him , and he becomes clear from any kind of court or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;

&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is a very excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding of children &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; according to his honor , it must be said that such education methods have to be reported in the fra@@ ction of the 1960s and the 1970s , far as parents as in teachers . &quot;
do you know such a bre@@ wery methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have found this even in a world @-@ school school , a state of state . &quot;
&quot; compared to this report , what is happening in this report , namely , the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violence on the subur@@ bs , are also Bag@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is a lot more about it and his role as a brother from Benedict XVI . to do so many media are just sitting on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who had never understood it , still alive . &quot;
the truth is : the Report ent@@ el@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , the report was much more about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the report report also any obligation to provide sexual abuse for the burden of sexual abuse ?
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
no one of the 67 victims of sexual dis@@ appears to have been familiar to the Cathedral of the Cathedral .
not once the parents were numbered .
&quot; I have never imag@@ ined to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I was very embarrass@@ ed for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the true problem of sexual abuse was , and is that most victims of shame will not be the victims of shame . &quot;
&quot; if they didn &apos;t want to be parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a choir of a choir , who would have been a col@@ ony of a col@@ onel . &quot;

&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : one of the most sought @-@ in school , he said : &quot; &quot; regarding sexual dis@@ sem@@ ination ... see no case , in which he would have had been able to stop in the world ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) . &quot;
&quot; however , I think it &apos;s not an absurd idea . I think it &apos;s quite absurd than her parents or more clear or more clear or rather than with their parents , Intern@@ ships , confidence @-@ instruc@@ tors etc . &quot;
&quot; you have to register first , to connect to this user . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report on the very clear result : &quot; that it is not confirmed in advance and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is it is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; in this way , it cannot be thrown to him , not to be prevented from him or to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these milit@@ ant crimes , as it was in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
the former Foreign Minister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is arrested in the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s a big problem that in the reporting all mixed and failed , was a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is a misuse of the report .
&quot; it is clean through between the pre @-@ school and school of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say , rest . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report reports from the time since 1945 , so that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; the entire terrible testing of ped@@ agog@@ ics , the cases where they have been ab@@ used by sa@@ di@@ stic teachers , and among them were mentioned in the camp in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ ill@@ ful states have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with whom the Cathedral of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when she had already been on the dom@@ inion . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , as most witnesses , the subject &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; menu . &quot;
it was only happy that you come to be and see the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : since glori@@ fied discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the report that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all efforts , the report also define the report only two times in which it was reported on the subur@@ bs of the subur@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish and responsible for a school in which he was not , and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t hear , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
&quot; Ben R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the feed @-@ up , for the ears of the ears ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , since 1989 , he wrote an letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ar , the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in the course of this , he will continue to practice this in the pre @-@ school school . &quot;
&quot; in view of the risk of negative press public authorities , he recommended urgent steps . &quot;

&quot; before , they were in a legal position , like every one of us still know . &quot;

&quot; but one can &apos;t say , he would have always been ce@@ ased . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter .
&quot; in 1980 , the exam@@ in@@ ers of schools have been officially recognized in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we talk to the historian from the &quot; case of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; so the danger is to assess the danger of today &apos;s moral principles . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but this is of course not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ sent to all times , and not for what in the subur@@ bs of resistance and violence against innocent children , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
that &apos;s all very terrible and I am glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all that had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means to prepare and in@@ suffici@@ ency , so @-@ looking and in the hair and ears were widely used in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; as a physical exercise , it has to be kept strictly prohibited . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Time was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger as in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : now , in the book , it is the life of his brother Joseph , and Pope Bene@@ dict@@ ts X@@ VIII . &quot;
&quot; however , I was not at any time that he led it to the present reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , it would hardly be possible to form a institution of space in Europe and its musical tradition that would have been in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 ) and Japan ( 1988 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons , you have no big singer and Bon@@ b@@ ons , no big singer and before every success , even in the area , but always discipline , passion and self over@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; as for a man , you have experienced a book in his book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : thanks to the work on the book and in addition , I studied Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well in the book and in addition as wonderful , hum@@ ility , deep and heart@@ y people , which could not imagine that he could not imagine that he could do something else . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact him , he will visit him - he is almost blind - and it is a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t forgive him , that he was strictly strictly to them , so clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always had a good , v@@ esti@@ al teacher - a stric@@ ter father , certainly , that may be , but also a loving understanding that she was still alive . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly , everything that you get to it , education methods that were at the time of the day &apos;s day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long gone this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ real , a man , just because he is the right thing , and a well known brother , for medi@@ al sinn@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is the evil one , that is not too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , the report was published , ent@@ el@@ et him . &quot;
&quot; now it would have acquired a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great services , and perhaps of Germany probably no one of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen would go to peace in peace . &quot;
