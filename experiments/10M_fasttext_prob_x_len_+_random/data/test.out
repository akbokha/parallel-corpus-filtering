&quot; he will be able to drive progress , and he makes it easier for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private companies and for companies . &quot;

assistance to new labour markets : demands for new labour measures

&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) , the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demanded his entire Council , from early September to more labour measures . &quot;
the J@@ DC said that there would have been ministers to be able to worry about the contract on the contract .
&quot; Reddit Posted in David Axe , English , Politics in General &#124; Leave a comment &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who have chosen for elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government has been rejected by the government . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in worship of the J@@ DC board , the proposed new contract will be able to reject the proposed new contract . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the Government , the J@@ DC Executive has set a formal application to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council , to begin a return program on a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council . &quot;
&quot; in the history of the N@@ HS , the first overall impression of the N@@ HS , the first total loss in history of N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA Club , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana stood after the election of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the B@@ MA , which were recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he said B@@ MA members during the sessions , which had been found before the coordination of 54@@ 0,000 associates and Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ud@@ dly , with that the contract is not accepted and accepted . &quot;
&quot; according to the Commission said the health Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt , that the contract for physicians in England would have been introduced . &quot;
&quot; Russia and Turkey : &quot; &quot; alliance of outside wounded &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a rock that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up the hands , and an official end of the eight months of the war of the words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace , I can &apos;t believe that Ankara cannot make sense . &quot;
&quot; yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; but coup in sm@@ alli@@ ous , and he moved back heat , even for his back relationships . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ ogan , said from his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he said , that the relations of Russia does not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even even further . &quot;
&quot; on the next day , a newspaper that Erd@@ ogan had been so ben@@ evol@@ ent , as would never happen something to happen . &quot;
I would like to have the contrary to the contrary .
&quot; but one of Putin , Putin showed that the State of Russia has nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in its expression . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ asted .
Putin accused Putin and accused Ankara , Russia into the back . &quot;
&quot; that was even greater , since it was quite bigger because there was a better friend . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ art @-@ controlled media are the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed to be the door for all the iniquity . &quot;
&quot; most of the most serious crimes in Syria , that Erd@@ og@@ ans would benefit its own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which might be controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ism state . &quot;
he has proved this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message that it was time to look back to the front .
&quot; finally , this meeting was only for this meeting , because of Putin from the President of Erd@@ ogan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is clear on hand . &quot;
&quot; Erd@@ ogan requires all friends that he can get after the last month at a failed state , almost all of his am@@ ended . &quot;
the terrorist attacks on Turkey took place .
but there are economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have been made in Turkey , in particular the ban of Char@@ ter@@ gau , which are usually several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;

&quot; a report in Ve@@ oli@@ sta form@@ ulate it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there for long , tom@@ atoes here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; in Ankara , Ankara &apos;s reaction to the West , since it was a response to the tried of power as a moderate answer . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the increasing Gro@@ ll on the Schn@@ eck@@ o of the EU membership negotiations and Putin - the desire to pull out of the cool mood and the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state in Ankara and security had a bonus for the chosen state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art support for the chosen state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is true for Moscow and a self @-@ understanding , which has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ ents before reg@@ im@@ e@@ change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this massive palace on the sea , Russia and Turkey , as it was a analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of outside wounded &quot; &quot; alliance of outside wounded , &quot; &quot; alliance of outside wounded , &quot; &quot; alliance of outside wounded and poor@@ ly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public aton@@ ement between the two still major differences . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently received the role as peace , but where Russia and Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it could be possible that after almost three hours at first talks , both president told both President on the press conference that they did not have ever been stolen . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey is set to answer a question about their differences , while Putin has decided to empha@@ size this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus about where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months , the hos@@ tility and the potential for a perfect balance , as the NATO member of Turkey in the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et , it is certainly better that the two state awards at least once again . &quot;

I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy about that it has happened to New@@ market , because I am reading more than 30 years ago . &quot;

&quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best products of the Modern and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone , only a few before him . &quot;
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it &apos;s his tactical bass that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a fantastic ambassador for the race , his debut album and Char@@ is@@ ma fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said , Frank@@ ie from some weeks ago by Ep@@ som , that he would have already been awarded 6@@ .000 entries , if he would not only be a weekend - and large tur@@ tle jo@@ ckey would be ! &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already released almost 30 years of winner , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British racing , but it is an incredible adventure . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying balance
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to flying dis@@ mounting , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been a hanging sign of the British flat flat . &quot;
it was ner@@ ven@@ ous .
&quot; a whole series of large tur@@ tle , including its famous &quot; &quot; Gl@@ or@@ ical &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also lived a airline , and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he returned to the difficulties , when he returned from his six@@ sm@@ on@@ gen sperm , but he showed an impressive strength to return to his branches , and to return to his funeral . &quot;
&quot; and he is still not at the end of the end of D@@ ett@@ ori once again , that he will continue to continue until he will continue to continue until he will continue to continue until he will continue . &quot;

&quot; one generation that played the game , when she was still younger , she decided to pull off the sofa for the search of the sofa . &quot;

&quot; many public support campaigns to health , people want to bring people to take advantage of 30 minutes to take away from the sofa , because many public messages are boring and they come out of people who look like . &quot;

it has a breakthrough .

&quot; we used crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings , so that we said to &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon .
&quot; instead of only about the products , we wanted to talk to a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on a interesting type of ways .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the Director of the film , added : &quot;

there are many things to take into account as this property is probably not so beautiful part of the walls .
the family is dedicated to the family and their reputation .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that the family had made the family who had made the family who had made the family with bas@@ eb@@ ans , drug abuse , drug trade , and excessive persec@@ utions . &quot;

&quot; we stood on , because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not the same . &quot;
&quot; now , where they are finally , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Association , said that it would have been promoting the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;

&quot; this was a very difficult moment , since the behavior was extremely difficult and its acts to be horrible for their neighb@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the congregation , which are bound to us and we have made the information we have done . &quot;
I hope that this development will not be toler@@ ated and will not toler@@ ate the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .

&quot; the defeat was not too bad in this day - and they were able to be proud of this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament - and they were able to continue their efforts in this tournament , in which they were New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 at the same day could fall back on them in the final day . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji was formed in this form a 15 @-@ man team in order form . &quot;

&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , but it &apos;s hard to use them . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athlete , which reflects the surface with elegance of sw@@ apping , what is not the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es to go@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold of the Ru@@ ge , a Bat@@ ail@@ lon is willing to make the difference between the difference and there was none of the trainer that was before 30 months . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
and that &apos;s what I thought about it .
&quot; if you do not do it , it is everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a fairly bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start the start at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , what the inter@@ ruption of a minimum , if the inter@@ ruption is at a minimum . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , therefore I had to go better . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital , and ran around around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they told that some steps would be enough . &quot;
how to start it .
the Ru@@ ins is already a challenge but that makes it too much larger .
&quot; in the middle of the victory of the victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning a bit more than otherwise , and that tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; the scanning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a use in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was a emotional w@@ reck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much me that means , how much I and Helen and even Robin was working . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
it is the best trainer of the world .
I would have no better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena bells and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not mi@@ tig@@ ated .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , as the teams made from New Zealand and Denmark , the scanning and bells too much in Reserve . &quot;
we were very excited at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; lead in the process , lead to the process . &quot;
it is really important to do with it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something wrong .
&quot; we wanted to get a complete result , we wanted to go a good result , and win the race as we did . &quot;

most people sing in the choir and share the joy of the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by means of regular meetings , the social contacts made up and maintain . &quot;
&quot; as often , social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; these experience also has a certificate of Ur@@ sel in its choir , and to organise themselves , and to learn to learn from another - a choir is a very special form of life . &quot;

&quot; even if it is about to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; at the older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Government of the Senior Citiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher value to the daily life , both in school and leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz is often observed that the S@@ ingen or horns of lights are often associated with older people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; with li@@ ed@@ texts and especially melodies , themselves de@@ men@@ tia themselves are taken for long periods of events . &quot;
&quot; at S@@ ingen , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , it is possible to concentrate on its own voice and to adapt to the other singer - that &apos;s a big challenge . &quot;
&quot; there are many people who live alone , not only to concentrate on itself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that you know through the S@@ ingen in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;

anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate to do something - even if he wants to have little talent .
&quot; if you are not alone with 50 sin@@ king people , who hear it , if there is a sound ? &quot;
&quot; in search for the right choice , have a variety of options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;

&quot; although there are no direct references to the government , the government will have to change the reports to change the reports , it shows how analysis is exposed to the pressure from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress was clearly positive as it was the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military intervention of Mos@@ sul@@ s already mentioned in April or May 2015 . &quot;

&quot; democratic members of the intelligence service published on Thursday , Thursday their own insights into some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Force Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has been an excessive process for the development of re@@ building services to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; at the representative office Adam B. ship , in a opinion . &quot;

&quot; in the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are too late , the Olympic Games are the Olympic Games . &quot;

&quot; it is , as would be the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el himself a fire@@ able st@@ ab , who will protect the s@@ wimm@@ ers from the w@@ s@@ wimm@@ ers to the Lord to the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can read the TV , a newspaper or the conversation of your neighb@@ ors in the waiting period , without over this photo , K@@ atie Le@@ ase@@ y or the battle between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is at the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s women , would have been sent to the Prime Time , which would have been sent to the Prime Time , when he would have a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Bash@@ ar or even F@@ og@@ a . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ int@@ ur@@ ns of gold . &quot;
&quot; the Olympic flame is lit , not every event . &quot;
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade , the sports are not recognized : air guns , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast to swim and may keep it long .
&quot; but if I make a modest arguments for my particular attention , then let me make the attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ comes already has been a Olympic event , when it was in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so that many that I had hoped that it was at all at all at all . &quot;
this could be the local ignorance of ignorance .
&quot; although the US athlete said to the competition , it has never been a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 a athlete that has been done until the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for men and Chinese and to share the can@@ opy for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ ines has a certain outdoor table , partly because it sounds for the invisible ear as the Olympic Games sounds like the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; I would like to admit that I have no expert , but I am an expert . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ical quotes - but also the gra@@ ves of the gymn@@ astics and do@@ ves , which combines two types of sports , which combines it . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; dates back from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means so much as &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; up to 30 feet on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , take almost up to 30 feet in the air and must have a number of the movements ( Dre@@ es , H@@ encing and sal@@ tos ) before it comes to the feet . &quot;
&quot; they will be evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ ogram to design , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ sided athletes made from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic stadium is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts have to continue to go to gold , fast , sometimes , and back to the destination , sometimes , and back to the playground . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re not only the Zi@@ ell@@ line or the output wall , but in the television transmission , but in the television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; it is important that it is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , and it is enough to stir even a viewer to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also that what I want to look at this games as a little fatigue .
it offers the tramp@@ oline a breathing break .

&quot; American military and secret services are closely linked to the Ethiopia , in order to fight terrorism through the region , especially in Latin America . just few countries in Africa , when at all , get so much western help . &quot;

its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new feature of the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; but when Ethiopia , all other than a model for democracy was the opposition of democracy , the opposition in the country was limited to the opposition in the country . &quot;
many were killed in the ex@@ ile or prison in prison or in the wounds of the desert .
but this could change .

a generation of generation .
there are numerous complaints that will cover everything from the ground use to power for power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a wide range of items , the reg@@ ained party and its allies expect the last seat of the opposition and control over 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ack@@ ness , controversial line called in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analysts believe that the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ liberation front or the National Socialist Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were in the last years more or less than less than 30 days , the tur@@ mo@@ il and armed forces could be armed . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of age are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first thing seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many branches of Ethiopia were able to communicate with social media , as the cheapest way , and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular ab@@ brevi@@ ations , especially with protests , many people still still communicate through Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , the hide where it is . &quot;
several young judges gave us that they gathered themselves up to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ anol in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; the am@@ aic of the am@@ nesty produced by the Am@@ har@@ as who come from the th@@ op@@ i@@ ens , mostly in the politics and economy , while they live the O@@ ro@@ mos , from which many Muslims have to live and in flat areas . &quot;
but even that changes itself .
&quot; we are able to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tiv@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
no Events were found with the defined settings Biwak # 17 : wild Food
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos , the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which is dominated by around 6 percent of the population , and in the military , in commerce and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the im@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death at a non @-@ profit disease in 2012 17 years after his death . &quot;
&quot; he was a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that it was particularly noticeable in the early signs of dis@@ satisfaction , and to use them to carry out opponents , and to make it un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing in this fundamental situation , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot;
&quot; the Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , has been selected for the position of Mr. Mel@@ es in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region North @-@ Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south . &quot;
analysts say that it is not the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result of more blood shed will be shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was born in 2005 , after thousands of elections in 2005 , after thousands of elections were destroyed by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the last months , many prot@@ agoni@@ sts were killed , even when it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively fast . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the new pend@@ ul@@ um leader for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ul@@ um , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress at the Arab@@ s . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of internal mis@@ understand@@ ings of the Iranian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; the last month of prot@@ agoni@@ sts in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , by Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred against the tiger &apos;s social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests of the United States and other Western allies are in an independent position .
&quot; the American government used the Ethiopia , as basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ heim , even when they recently closed the basis that it has closed this basis . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he wants not to be that his allies had already postpon@@ ed in a few months . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin tomb . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim in Washington .
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last framework to scatter the campaign , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the founder of Islam@@ ist state , not serious . &quot;
&quot; in this case , new questions to the communication skills of the presidential candidate of republi@@ can , whether it is clear and understandable to communicate with American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his fellow students who strive to take him during an event in protection , to explain that he could not have no meaning . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the presence in an election , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made it to an election on Thursday and was found in interviews that he really did not intend to point to the President and Mrs. Clinton . &quot;
&quot; but in a early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the second day was the previous day , which Mr. Tr@@ ump in a series of interviews , he said : &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy it , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate won &apos;t know anything . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism from the criticism of Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to get the focus of his campaign on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton &apos;s speeches on economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump started to return to this subject . &quot;
&quot; by Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already been brought to his defence .
&quot; in the end of July , he was strong criticism on himself as he said , the Russians should , Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons , however , he said later , he said later , &quot; I said the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the linguistic limits of politics and then return back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages taken from his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication partner , that the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to hold his statements , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; rather than the tone of the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has been accepted as a result of their tone as its change@@ over values have gone back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour in the Federal States of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and an head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; during Mr. Tr@@ ump , he tries to know his critic , he said his critic was frequently asked to understand his statements . &quot;
&quot; but while he strengthens the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et will have to be able to be able to stand his clients in the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ oked his statements . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says ? &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was founded to the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ unk statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton in the Islamic State would have been established . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Obama did an almost unknown , small organization , he called them . it was totally wrong , and therefore it happened because he came out of the troops from the Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the artists rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton , as an outdoor Minister , they have allowed themselves to raise the situation in the Middle East to control the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election of Mr. Tr@@ ump , Mr. Tr@@ ump his attacks on the media came and cast them before any of his words , and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; the poor , poor , j@@ acu@@ ated , television experts who try to understand him , and said , &quot; You cannot understand it ! &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a French director with Jewish roots was a member of a media player after he knew that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin is not listed in Berlin , since the Arab guests had been given according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin . he wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay we tried to find Israel on the country list of the hotels .
the country was not listed between the countries that can be placed directly from the hotel room .
&quot; as is in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible to eliminate Israel , and deleted by Israel ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol is an opportunity to choose Israel on a own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director was re@@ formed by the director . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the first quarter of 2008 , the German authorities said that the &quot; &quot; clear decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason , who stood behind the director , was still more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s , and they have given that the pre @-@ election will be deleted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ akov Had@@ as , called it a &quot; large shame &quot; , reported to the South German newspaper . &quot;

&quot; trade between Russia and Iran , suddenly down from 71 % to -@@ RT Business &quot;
&quot; with the aboli@@ tion of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ ans@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade union between Moscow and Teher@@ an in the annual comparison to 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in the Russian companies have been strong in the country in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
Russian companies take the existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the more trading construction was one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ ans@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the trade union between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imp@@ air@@ ments in Iran around 9@@ 1.5 percent imp@@ air@@ ments and bet@@ ru@@ sts $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trading ship was reached by deliveries , Land@@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ ans@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan stands for this year from a record number of Irish tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian Cons@@ ulates around 35@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , first line of travel as , on Irish citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran is the top 20 of the countries that affects the tourist quantity in Russia . &quot;
&quot; it could say that the record numbers are Irish tourists in Russia from the last year , he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time there are only relatively few Russians in Iran , something that will change the ambassador to change it . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit to the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of ancient civilization in a good condition . &quot;

future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the for@@ age of energy efficiency
&quot; the future of the aluminum sch@@ illing of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - are standing on the game , as the system operator will lift the energy supply agreement and thus provide all delivery contracts . &quot;
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria in the beginning of this year .
&quot; one for 20 years , sub@@ vention runs in November from November . &quot;
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ mond in Port@@ land , are available on the game . &quot;
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect , could be avoided at a closing date . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to Dom@@ ino@@ effective , since the melting of around 10 percent of the total electricity generation has been used . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , Al@@ titude the point of Henry melt , which led to a closing of the fishing gate . &quot;
the melting of ageing in Port@@ land loses money and risk a loss .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation on the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which is the big aluminium mel@@ t@@ ner with his Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ or@@ Valley , said that it is that three additional owners will be asked their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is located in a joint venture of Al@@ ben@@ ina and Al@@ um@@ ina , which the Chinese companies CIT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni boats smaller shares . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , AG@@ L said that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; backup jobs &quot; &quot; who would have been able to force in force in force . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of time so that it will be 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L will help the contracts in the financial year 17 to the income , &quot; said the power supply . &quot;

&quot; he said that the decision to book the contracts that book al@@ co@@ as ... the melting of Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting of the melting of the melting of the melting of the melting of the melt . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that it was a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have been in force in force , even if it is still a statement , why it is still under the contract . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the industry is based on the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closing of the Port@@ land mines in Victoria , and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysis of the analysis of the analysis , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land has approximately 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; however , both systems should disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction of demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

England must expand the Olympic Spirit and He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and in all London , but in all the land of renewal and prosperity . &quot;

the Olympi@@ ad met great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .

&quot; as in London 2012 , it will be able to think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is large . &quot;

now they are ready to deliver a third balance sheet which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row also will be another success .

N@@ ASA climate amo@@ dell : Venus was once be@@ amed .
the Venus was most likely according to the project of a new N@@ ASA climate control .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the N@@ ASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that are similar to climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if the Venus is designed with its hot , water surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously stated that the slow down of Venus will be explained by their tight atmosphere .
&quot; the latest simulation indicates that the Venus might have a thin , similar atmosphere , and still slow down slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the Planet , probably the more dry areas as de Earth , but was once enough water and ge@@ opoli@@ tical vari@@ ability to host lives and more quickly inc@@ iner@@ ated . &quot;
the early Venus benefited from a Sun that was up to 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow down of Venus has been increased by the sun nearly two months , the G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; the surface and produced rain , which has a thick layer of clouds , which has a thick layer in order to guarantee the surface of a majority of solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperature , which can be cool as the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought a history of Venus , which was similar to evolution . &quot;
&quot; even though it was probably be@@ amed , the Venus -- in the course of several hundred years of heat and ultra violet light . &quot;
&quot; its oc@@ eans and its water vap@@ ours was removed from ultra violet light . &quot;

the latest News with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ zel has helped A@@ stronom@@ y to collect the full catalogue on Rot@@ ating rates under the stars of the star of the ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data will help the A@@ stronom@@ y to understand why the stars in the star can be rot@@ ated to different races as well as in which the red @-@ time zones can be found with the plan of planning .
&quot; we hope that we would like to learn about our results with another star , more about the relationship between the mass of a man , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a research on C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s disease and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ j@@ ades of the ple@@ j@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years from the earth .
&quot; there are many stars in this star , which have been created in approximately 125 million years now , now the adult age . &quot;
it is now on the fastest time .
&quot; at the top of the moment , these stra@@ igh@@ s large amounts of con@@ junc@@ tions were made . &quot;
&quot; because these win@@ ches are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a strong effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , it begins to slow down its rotation rate . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each action by giving the time between the appearance of a scientific star line -- such as paras@@ ols -- .
the latest catalog of Rot@@ ation rates has to make sure to turn up to massive stars as a less massive @-@ stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull is like the stars with dances , but larger stars slow down to a smaller pi@@ rou@@ ch as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow down to be massive to be solid , even against faster rotation to be very bright star , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star of the ple@@ j@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star of the ple@@ j@@ ade offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar Rot@@ ation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much about us to learn how how , W@@ ann and Why stars their red ones slow down , and so to make their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have detailed information about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the ple@@ j@@ ads , which soon appear in A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called to buy fire@@ able cars in the last weeks . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied by now the inhabitants of contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; &quot; has been referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms at the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ hof , with 300 police officer , pat@@ rol the police three weeks later , pat@@ rol parts of the street and held visitors from the street , and held visitors from the street to the number of 94 . &quot;
the renovated construction workers in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court that was illegal was illegal , and a day later , the police and construction workers were under the Ju@@ bel of sympathy and accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on this summer , the road was peaceful and parents go with children . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of building projects there is a basic school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; the left force is not the main character of many an@@ onym@@ ously : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in 1999 in the neighborhood , and Jana * , who is here three children , especially from the police station . &quot;

&quot; in 1990 , there are numerous houses in the former East Germany , numerous houses in the former East region , including almost the whole main@@ board road near the Rig@@ ger Street . &quot;
&quot; during the Main@@ zer , many of the projects have been inhabited in a right @-@ right side , many of the projects have been inhabited by the Riga leg@@ alisation and will have been occupied by the people who had inhabited before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city in the last years are increasingly to the magn@@ ets for tourists and artists from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings were attacked as a symbol for this development : it det@@ ects them on designed discs or fresh baked , which were disc@@ arded with dy@@ es . &quot;
&quot; no other street , this year was so often together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ in violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is why not all the neighb@@ ors do this as a problem , could be affected by the Crime time that they are not necessarily affected by the crime . &quot;
&quot; the most significant part of the criminal cases do not damage the damage , rather than the newly built @-@ in houses and fresh renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been inhabited for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , can be no speech . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it is important to me : the people in the 94 are their neighb@@ ors who are not allowed . &quot;
&quot; as well as the famous fire@@ able cars , it is now no longer a longer time . &quot;
&quot; for the studied archit@@ ec@@ tures , their street is no criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here is one another , lives together on the road and gets more than one another . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it was so important that the local residents get back to their street : from the police , politics and media , which suddenly suddenly stopped the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents , such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken into consideration : by sc@@ aff@@ inity of new buildings in former construction builders , the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are the apartments which are not interesting for many here - here they are more people who are not so good , &quot; says she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I can do absolutely no harm . &quot;
but what should you do if one never hear someone else ?
&quot; it is on all sides of fru@@ stration , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for instance , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , has a little understanding of the work and the left scene . &quot;
&quot; those who look like to be aware of that - exactly how someone who is in a Knei@@ pp area , there is bad about noise . &quot;
