<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of age are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first thing seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many branches of Ethiopia were able to communicate with social media, as the cheapest way, and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular abbreviations, especially with protests, many people still still communicate through Internet proxies, the hide where it is."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young judges gave us that they gathered themselves up to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethanol in Ethiopia."</seg>

<seg id="36">"the amaic of the amnesty produced by the Amharas who come from the thopiens, mostly in the politics and economy, while they live the Oromos, from which many Muslims have to live and in flat areas."</seg>

<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos, the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of ethnic group of the Tigray, which is dominated by around 6 percent of the population, and in the military, in commerce and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the imrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death at a non-profit disease in 2012 17 years after his death."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>

<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this fundamental situation," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"the Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected for the position of Mr. Meles in order to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region North-Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that it is not the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result of more blood shed will be shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was born in 2005, after thousands of elections in 2005, after thousands of elections were destroyed by the government."</seg>

<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of internal misunderstandings of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the last month of protagonists in Gondar, an amharic city, by Tigray guided shops and the hatred against the tiger's social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests of the United States and other Western allies are in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used the Ethiopia, as basis for Dronenheim, even when they recently closed the basis that it has closed this basis."</seg>
