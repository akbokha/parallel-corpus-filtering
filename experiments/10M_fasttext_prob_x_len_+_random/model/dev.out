this will happen when the parent increases the interest .
&quot; interest income , and the domestic interest will come into the wake of a return for bonds , and the economy will come into a recession . &quot;
let &apos;s know .
what we do not know how long it is to take and how long it gets .
&quot; in particular , the history of economy is very low for business . &quot;
a recession came into recession after only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of the economy and financial assets . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representative of the US Central Bank will inform that investors should not be able to concentrate when it starts to increase the interest rates but rather on the period that the norm@@ alisation is needed . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables have a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement of a tor@@ ing interest may be out@@ spoken . &quot;

&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of the United States to normal levels , but still to a low level to fear for sei@@ s@@ mic shock , which seem to be afraid to fear . &quot;
however does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a historic survey based on historic economy based on how some areas of the economy could react .
&quot; like the market in the last month , the guar@@ di@@ ans of interest @-@ control things can be depos@@ ited for a few months . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase has begun , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; and there are apparently a tendency that seriously under@@ lines up 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ ses in a newer study conducted by F@@ ed Li@@ bor increases . &quot;

&quot; in contrast to this , this is obviously low @-@ slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest in which the F@@ ed has been waiting for the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has so far more than 74 months . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted themselves on monetary policy . &quot;

experts are critic@@ ise for the public Health Organization about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; allegations are a state financial agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes less harmful than smoking were made of 12 persons , partially with links to tobacco industry , they said . &quot;
&quot; experts within the British Medical Association ( BM@@ J ) write , L@@ anc@@ et began to critic@@ ise L@@ anc@@ et by taking the public health Health ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
the PH@@ E published the &quot; fundamental view &quot; in the past month and describes it as an &quot; comprehensive investigation of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have placed the capacity of the data in@@ lay and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial department of the medical specialist magazine L@@ anc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; was an excellent foundation on PH@@ E to his most important conclusions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there are two additional researchers in the BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for the European Public Health at the London School of Technology and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ ologist , professor for Klin@@ ische Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies to be able to improve the effectiveness of the effectiveness . &quot;

&quot; PSYNDEX is the most comprehensive abstract database ( not full @-@ text ) of psychological literature , audiovisual media , intervention programs , and tests from the German @-@ speaking countries . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a firm called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose head to have received by British American Leg@@ ion Medi@@ ator ( BA@@ T ) . &quot;
he wrote also the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report .

reasons To Buy • This report provides you with valuable data for the personal accident and health insurance industry covering travel insurance in Spain .
several other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
the tab@@ let@@ op line also took part in PH@@ E .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; means &quot; means &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no such connections or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the statements of PH@@ E that &quot; there is no proof that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a path to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking .
&quot; Frank F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that the statements made by BM@@ J was previously re@@ acted in advance . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking .
every second life long smo@@ ker dies at its lowest point .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risk of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to these are low , but that we still have to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to information about what is the proof and does not , especially if there is enough public confusion over the relative risk of tobacco compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National health system of two billion pounds a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear clari@@ fications that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence . &quot;
&quot; in the event , we need to give up a political alternative to the Afghan population . &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said before the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give her right arm to the right arm as the Albert Square Soap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the radio fee is only used to make the type of programs , which do not be sent by other UK transmitter . &quot;
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC to ensure that it publicly announced publicly @-@ legal programmes that probably be seen by a smaller audience , in hard dism@@ issed newspaper frame against the most popular shows of their rivals and of Sen@@ als such as BB@@ C2 . &quot;

&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programmes have been there or sends , which would be un@@ interrupted by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , Johnson said Johnson to the upper @-@ communications committee on the occasion of his investigation via the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I am medi@@ ated or working for a good idea , it should be at least on programs that do not make any job or job . &quot;
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they wish to achieve a large support for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive wheel programs are financed without subsidies . &quot;
the Voice is such a program established in East@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; in honest , other channels would give their right arm to their right arm . &quot;

&quot; the scientists said that the power of a new process called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;

the ampli@@ fiers of ultr@@ asonic sensor can be named as the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the seas@@ oned cells .
&quot; the sound waves achieve the opening of these particles , enable the cells that are assigned to the cells that are assigned to the body in such a report . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound all @-@ controlled N@@ emat@@ odes , changed Chal@@ de@@ ani @-@ gene@@ tically , so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels can carry out . &quot;
&quot; when he sur@@ rendered to the altered cre@@ sts , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied and transferred into the wor@@ ms when they switch the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the method has several simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground breaking tool , the scientists allows to turn out and off the neur@@ ons of light in the light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to a optical fiber on the desired location in the brain , the low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic tissue can happen quickly and can be shipped in the brain of top to the skull . &quot;

&quot; for light over@@ weight diabe@@ tics , loss loss may be useful for weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of weight loss surgery for light over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes is estimated at least 5 years after a new study of at least five years . &quot;
it is still too early to say whether they are often over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss for longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .

&quot; obes@@ ity or Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , use various methods to enlarge the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce fat and borders the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; obes@@ ity operations are proved to be effic@@ acy , but most studies have been carried out in humans which are disease @-@ related with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or later . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I - some degree of weight in regards to size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ valued , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered as fat . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study used for the new study used by Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng &apos;s Hospital data , which they have been collected in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ posit@@ as @-@ surgery - Mag@@ ist@@ as , ga@@ stri@@ ction , for medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people who are easy over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I below which controls this operation , dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
the BM@@ I remained below the BM@@ I for those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments ( approximately equal to 29 ) .
&quot; among those who under@@ pinn@@ ed a surgical intervention , 20 % of the diabetes disease is entirely up to 28 % . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL @-@ cholesterol , generally better at the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients also benefit patients in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glu@@ cose levels in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is kept up in 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level was around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in medical therapy group , however , it remained stable in about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how to re@@ prove themselves in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - increase is not the dying in five years , so the guiding researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team showed the average results in the case of two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the bypass surgery group had lost weight ( 18.@@ 7 versus 14.@@ 2 kg ) , larger set@@ backs in the BM@@ I ( 7.6 % and 2.@@ 2.1 % ) and awarded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.8 % vs. 2.7 % ) . &quot;

&quot; although the new study no advantage for survival at the surgery of patients , Black@@ stone , it was cal@@ ming for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because they say that this operation is lower , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone has added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient has reached its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we wait for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I think that once they have found this genetic change , that is associated with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a recur@@ ring is difficult . &quot;

&quot; even though the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria knew the efforts of the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile over several thousand refugees will look nice , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly thanks to education , for these Muslim countries . &quot;
ultimately we must think how killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama explained the problem of violence and commented on George Bush@@ s action after the terrorist attack from 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after the 11th of September I reminded my opinion in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;

&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was completed in January above his best friend , and even though I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I started to be afraid . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would have a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see rules in the United States , and as often more applications than places are available , a ma@@ ze lot@@ tery will take place in order to choose who choose . &quot;

&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and cle@@ ave a pen to draw what I see . &quot;

I think that it would have been better for them to do better . but they still thinks it is wrong which I do .
&quot; Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of things I said , and written . &quot;
&quot; he says to me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international reporter was present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help the death penalty . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is guilty . &quot;
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would reject him to be a special attitude of fact .

&quot; however , while they were given the points there was no classical character of Laurent squ@@ ads Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he became a game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , which he started his career . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ hill in the Champions League . so , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win and relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to have been perfect in the course of the season . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;

&quot; but except one kiss of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ ic , who passed far on Kevin Tra@@ ys P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they headed to the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes going on , with some mis@@ ses and bad caps , not least in the first half of the first half , and then before Cav@@ ani has used him after re @-@ start after the re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; he had much more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and was a passage from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , Di Maria in a revol@@ t , which was passed by Wil@@ ly in the 5@@ 2nd minute . &quot;
