Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
these two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an at the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , it should also go about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ States solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zed Israel &apos;s ongoing settlements in Israel and will ensure the lack of will@@ ingness to renew the peace process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deal of the Obama deal for Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the two had deterior@@ ated further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the invitation of the US Congress in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partly appointed to Obama &apos;s aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting held this with regard to the agenda to be im@@ min@@ ent in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call you have shot a friend who shot his friend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb is told with a slightly z@@ ailed voice of the police , that he was shot for his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside the house , the officers came out against Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a hand@@ written notice that I was trying to make it happen . I loved Amy and she was signed from Lamb in the letter , and it was signed from Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who instructed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississippi , had already 300 miles to the school in which he was killed and killed in his office by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University Eye employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Lamb has made a fatal emergency call sometime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after the shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to check out what Lamb is motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details that were published by the investigations on both ends of the state have expressed details , as well as those who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but maybe some difficult teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students said they were looking forward to teaching some classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Gau@@ l , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written from him , in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both educated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lines to be proble@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said , He also seemed very excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had asked from the Delta State University in asking for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; latest amendments to the University &apos;s employment policy , meaning that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked hard , would give him no warranty for an automatic way to appointment as Assistant professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said that he got nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something said in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are questions , which Lamb can no longer answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the escape from the campus the police found Lam@@ bs track after he came back to the Mississippi of Arkan@@ sas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car was running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb grew up in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did his doctorate in education in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs proved him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said that she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy , who tried to teach the guitar game for some years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was the W of Women at the time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all girls are melted away , when he was there , hair@@ ston , now 40 and located in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously together some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency Lamb Lamb , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you had a bar@@ k called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that joins an Ba@@ you in Gau@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police told that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had been and a daughter who had been 19 years old now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the bottom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , Lamb is never met , but he &apos;s heard because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , argu@@ ing music and playing blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail got both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse which worked online for several companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes a enter@@ tain@@ ement coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ l , said that his Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night ended at night before a terrible audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no sign of evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple &quot; he said .
we were scra@@ pped and rus@@ hed together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the University of Kansas University in Kansas , and became President of his br@@ otherhood and the Student Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including faculty , staff , students and members of the church on a candle light celebration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ piece Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff were also part of the Mah@@ n@@ guard , while the university &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students &quot; return &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io So@@ lis reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and and Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ on P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried this report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb didn &apos;t shot the emergency call that he had shot at the emergency call P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s while his wife were shot , but there is no indication that the two had ever been married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
toys R Us plans to hire less labour power for the holiday season
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products says that he will currently give a chance to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that she was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centres across the country . in 2014 , 4@@ 5.000 workers have been hired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be part time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start this month with job interviews , and the number of employees will rise from October to December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the holidays itself are still months away , the Christmas shop is closer and companies preparing to equi@@ p their employees to stock stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael J. Fox dances over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is next to me , and it will gradually be sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a sim@@ ulated stit@@ ch and a diameter of it bin from Wales would be at a date with the princess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; is a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd and director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really good for me &quot; says Spiel@@ berg , &quot; unc@@ anny was the biggest trip film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinema in October .
UN Head says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon calls his response to Russia &apos;s stronger military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict and more weapons and mis@@ ery to wor@@ sen millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and take an inclusive and inclusive negotiations to finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since a press conference on Wednesday , he plans to discuss the Foreign Secretary of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the insur@@ rection in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this situation is in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he insi@@ sted on the five decent members to show the same solidarity and on@@ eness in Syria , which they proved to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 und@@ ulations to show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to stamp it on the flop .
others have abol@@ ished it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in the p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some start to be seriously asking what is meant for the chances of nom@@ ination of Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that trumpet is likely to gain the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys took the lead on the rising tide . none of them won only a state in the Nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
but outside groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth can now begin tr@@ umps to flow and start to flow their dollars to rush into .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some current survey values , suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary period is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ umps popular properties have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans had seen the estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa , last week noted that 60 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of drop@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ tor GO@@ P would be happy with dump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Republi@@ can said they were either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied . &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two of 10 say that they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they are &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about pumping over ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the nearest in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; dis@@ ma@@ yed &quot; if Y@@ eb Bush , the owner of the establishment , the candidate would . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans does not see tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive voters , 52 percent of the Irish people believe the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post takes place on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is in the first monetary state of the nation , the federal state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a commander in the same week , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his post , and nearly six of 10 independ@@ ents say that His temp@@ er did not suit the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they sit up their scholars , please make republi@@ can elec@@ tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from the past week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change from time , when four of ten ended her money in J@@ eb Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P elec@@ tors had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry was able to gain nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless a wide variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ ump campaign is shown as plau@@ sible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when the Re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump performs almost everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that this sh@@ utter field probably contributes to tr@@ umps lead , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump @-@ support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other Can@@ didate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a presum@@ ed head @-@ on @-@ head between t@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump res@@ cu@@ res the majority supports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he scored 13 points ahead of the Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points before J@@ eb defeated 19 points and finally before the end of Paul , John Ka@@ isa and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who sm@@ ates him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a presum@@ ed head @-@ to @-@ head race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says , that they have made their minds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only little more than half of the voters can support tr@@ ump , say that they have awarded their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , a lot of things can happen to change that , and no one can really say that you can never change my mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 percent said that they can leave the door open to another candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters think they have formed their minds , are twice as often for pumping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ des with dump on immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump came to his election campaign about two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration to a pi@@ ration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of drop@@ outs will keep central His@@ p@@ ano American by the Republi@@ can Party and will avoid re @-@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the issues of immigration .
so long does the immigration in li@@ mel@@ ight remain ) Donald Tr@@ ump is apparently doing so .
the fru@@ stration about the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son won about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , notably by their out@@ si@@ dian status . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post and you prefer a political foreign group as someone with a experience in government experience .
and they are also li@@ vid to Washington .
a study by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Iowa showed two weeks ago that three out of four Iowa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress of 54 percent . &quot;
Munich and Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street , a square meter of a dead house cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited , so in the study it is thus the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows how a square meter is most cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top residential sites , the price is just like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Eth@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential premises - with square prices , in di@@ zz@@ ying heights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter per square meter .
but well who can afford it ...
the way : Munich is just not at the top here .

the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick game in the Champions League during the Greek record double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry . ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth position in series is to be the first step toward the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola is finally aim@@ ing to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his 28th competition in the Champions League , the champion gave good help from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had to pass a f@@ lange face shot of the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate that Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the play at the Kar@@ aj@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the translation held in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a focused and committed mis@@ conception without to shine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piraeus had his youngest six home games in the top class , including high @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was held in Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , defeated seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they gra@@ ci@@ ously ran to work with her obvious efforts but often too much to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacks were often induced by shift bearings on left outside , leading to the previous brown Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Müller made more luck than his flan@@ k from the right se@@ field in the left upper to@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski was the best occasions in half of one .
first of all things Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown has hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee @-@ par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern was working out with domin@@ ating game so Pir@@ ate was able to put pi@@ pe@@ ti@@ lit@@ es .
but he was susp@@ icious at the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , as he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola was def@@ ending a quarter @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the Centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario I@@ pag@@ ans , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , initially spent outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup @-@ Her@@ o had given the green light only after the closing training , &quot; said Sport@@ ony Matthias Sam@@ mer in &quot; Sky . &quot; he wants to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the distant Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear about 13 minutes later , Müller made a fine again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the game it was come to Kra@@ v@@ all in the stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of some dominated Bavaria @-@ fans in her audience @-@ blo@@ c , the supporters of host Pir@@ ate had been prov@@ oked by words and gest@@ ures , attacks against the security forces and went out of ra@@ ging against the Munich trailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was wounded from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes ) has a higher risk of losing their teeth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you smoke , it does not just harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this is close to Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good news : the risk is falling down quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , the risk of losing their teeth is pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to make the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
major causes of dental loss of c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ums are st@@ resses the DI@@ RE@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis .
the connection between smoking and the loss of teeth is therefore frequent on frequent gum infections with smokers .
not be defined if smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who had hearing with smoking , but may reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it couldn &apos;t take more than ten years until the haz@@ ard is on the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ du@@ p Thomas Dietrich showing the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to convince people of it , non @-@ smoking , the study manager H@@ einer dropped from the DI@@ RE@@ E : &quot; smoke short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for the lungs and v@@ ascular and leads to our insights even to good dental health up to high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of insom@@ nia , the DI@@ BA@@ E took part in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier investigations were advised that smoking rise the risk for early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .

EU Commission proposes the TTIP a new trial
the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to def@@ use the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the controversial private con@@ ciliation facilities for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system , equivalent to much more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens &quot; acknowle@@ d@@ gment the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström today on the performance .
the Swe@@ de before attemp@@ ting to call the proposal for a European negoti@@ ating position to the US trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings will be put on concrete terms , that EU states and the US are jointly independent judges for a new Admini@@ strative Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU and the EU and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is scheduled .
it would allow it to lodge against the verdict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the operations involved each other committed to arbit@@ er , a claims against their judgments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term she wants to work towards a International Investment Court in the long term .
there could then be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) in particular ought to be one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration shall be cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ism , to control national laws , national laws , or fall of consumer or environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first reported , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act agreed upon the proposals by the European Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is mainly critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated a free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ u ( SPD ) represented the plans as a great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the Reform &apos;s Reform substantial points , the Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel have worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private bit@@ ral courts may be from the table .
French Government also welcomed the plans by Malm@@ ström .
the European Enterprise Association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned to restri@@ ct the business possibilities of business by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises can be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed last Wednesday .
negotiations are running since mid @-@ 2013 .
but until now the focus of investment protection has not been discussed with the United States .
a framework for the agreement should be completed by the end of this year .
this appointment is considered as not acceptable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in eleven years , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to it , a fli@@ p@@ chart is set on which the shy C@@ emin@@ ently pre@@ emin@@ ent to the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt @-@ sti@@ ft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught in Stev@@ ens lecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells stories about various places , which he always records on the map , wor@@ r@@ ying his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where they came from and how it looks like it looks in his home .
since then Stev@@ ens has proved a wonderful Irish Irish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smar@@ tly composed songs , which can be harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time beautifully @-@ ripe dri@@ fts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it arises as rum@@ or that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a rejected series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be ens@@ hr@@ ined in succession .
but already in 2004 and close to the se@@ am &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and breaks a positive expectations .

the album climbed up into the American Bill@@ board charts and won &apos;t be one of the most influential music media in no time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following exceedingly productive experiment , Stev@@ ens is able to use the Age of Ad@@ z ( 2010 ) to very extensive electronic failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still very broad , but performed by program@@ ing sequences or beats and plays with a variety of effect and rever@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although here nearly 2000 guests have banned in their chairs , the rich@@ ness of the Stev@@ ens is back to the in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without alig@@ ning a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide enriched album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , one hears the lecture : the lecture was &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can cast off the &quot; record &quot; basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ ations
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister has been eag@@ erly awaited for its election by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ y Council and to create David Cameron for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will inc@@ ur to ask about the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his media is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from the proximity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that he can skip some sessions , to leave her colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary testing for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ let and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during the celebration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence be prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands on the core of several fron@@ tier pages in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them ! has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; He would have been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , ir@@ respective of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve as leaders in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they were called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth @-@ th of the Parliamentary party had originally supported him as leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ ch tells that political differences can also be st@@ acked within the Labour Union and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s remarks on position of the European Union and the limit for profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C @-@ conference that Labour to put Labour in order to remove the whole idea of a limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that she had only risen to 23@@ ,000 £ and £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory @-@ boss , over the last decade across the disp@@ lace box in parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different political approach , says that he made &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions about Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ y of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front , and that he will be under@@ pinn@@ ed by serious problems , such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the shadow of economic minist@@ erial in him if he is not participating - for example , Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally gras@@ p the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he had to remove himself from the Prime Minister &apos;s style . but a few years later he cleared the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since she was sent on TV first in 1990 , a leader with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of its leaders and his position among his parliamentary party and his position among his parliamentary reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Po@@ und rose slightly to data , showing a rise in the growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the growth target of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , the income climbed to 2.9 % in the United Kingdom compared with the same period of the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this percentage had been the quick@@ est of the world since 2009 and had a higher interest rate at the time of interest .
the Po@@ und rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index completed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ Z was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % due to the take@@ over offer of the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and make brands like Bud@@ ì@@ jo@@ vice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bur@@ berry Shar@@ es were after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods by Ri@@ chemical , 0.9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most recent sales figures suggest all expectations , and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - will se@@ duce growth again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE shares increased by 5 % after the mining industry , that he took 2.5 billion $ by stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest clubs in the index , namely , with a fall of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sachs has had given its assessment for the company Rating on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % after the sport @-@ changing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages increase expansion .
managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more sales force in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this department will exp@@ ire the higher labour costs from his company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

ever since it is turned into a barbecue sk@@ ewer that is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .

met@@ cash starts ground fighting campaign in comb@@ ating al@@ di@@ - her@@ fall
Met@@ co seeks to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
cash wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ level campaign in order to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar invasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Al@@ di opened the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets build their relations with local food suppliers and build up the social media , well above events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ig@@ A tra@@ der and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in IG@@ A @-@ shops and shop@@ ke@@ epers to sell exclusive tickets to the South Australian soccer league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash published further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ aler being passes for food , alcohol and equipment to its annual investors strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot on the game that uses South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ Lad@@ y@@ Industries and generate higher profits as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally Provin@@ cial &amp; IG@@ A retailers are a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia as compared to around 14 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stanley is believed that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of his first markets will cut off five percent of the food market in these two countries , but mostly self @-@ standing single han@@ se@@ ago@@ ing sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley is estimates that IG@@ A re@@ ta@@ iler could lose USD $ million per year and cash cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this progn@@ osis is based on the acceptance of that Al@@ di will be 25 subsidiaries in SA and 30 , and achieved a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in food and grocery supplies and amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high Fi@@ x@@ net cost could cost CHF 13 million pre @-@ tax profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the cash shares lo@@ oses by Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the most faithful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Stanley is expected to increase revenue in food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2015 , to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass and the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business lunch in Melbourne that met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to react to the comments given by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is assumed that a board member of met@@ cash is received in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2010 , IG@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s foods and food retail , which has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the wholes@@ aler is denied and invested more than 150 million dollars to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ acc@@ ths for hundreds of products every week with improving their shops due to fast @-@ growing fresh food and deliver better choices on private @-@ label foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says , that the prize runs and loading rehabilitation programs will be an award for the first time in 2017 , for the first time in four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as cri@@ tique for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deserves to view the president of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly rather praise his own behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ coon ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os that is repeatedly mentioned as &quot; Special A@@ KS , &quot; at the Montreal Masters with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA for the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying player in Cincinnati soon Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to propose instead of the refer@@ ee , with whom Harrison had to propose the Cy@@ ril and I should beat the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he was last seen , as he struck a tennis ra@@ cket after a potential U.S. open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is def@@ y was defended from He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow and competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I can make me fairly , is the fact that Th@@ an@@ asi was recru@@ ited a little into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was broken up as he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat of Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved himself very well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative conditions with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too strictly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old guy who works very hard and he has never seen a problem with the other players he is working hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to participate in the deci@@ de@@ dly decision that begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long @-@ lasting part to the team to return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is concentrated in the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ ril &#93; &quot; said He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Nick did a very fast asc@@ end on what people like Feder@@ er and Murray , he goes up into the eyes of the spotlight , and he has deser@@ ved some time out of the spotlight and it &apos;s best for the squ@@ ad and it &apos;s best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary proclaimed Not@@ with@@ stands The border with@@ holds refugees back
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary proclaimed the emergency call and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the tried to move illegal into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos followed the limit , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted to a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with rebellion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people escaped from violence , for an unknown time , stuck between the two control points of the countries and built there tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ stration went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them failed , the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and they cried ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian Police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some extracts from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister declared that it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back to Greece , while there are more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and will not be a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border brought a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels could not agree on joint immigration policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who would have taken refuge in Italy and Greece . by the end of the year , the EU states would have achieved further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit on the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the mig@@ rant crisis of the continent .
but Hungary had not put hopes of a bal@@ m action from Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the emergency call in two southern regions gave more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could stop streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants and the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata stated that even the prisoners of prison were deployed to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ ght from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and are not for protection - a view that is strongly contra@@ diction to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws that come into force at midnight , make the crossing the boundary or dam@@ aging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us who took the government along the southern border with Serbia for a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation which resulted from mass migration , the Hungarian authorities asser@@ ted emergency state , &quot; said Government Spe@@ aker Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must vote on the commitment of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ter from Associ@@ ated Press has been on the limit heavily armed by armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs as early as day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes Safety Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others had penet@@ rated the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come across from damage to the fence , and they are now accused of off@@ ences and off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities are thus quickly repair the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungarian officials also had two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday , after a train venture with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed the main border pass close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put it in a crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 20 took it out but thousands were left outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they arrive to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s &apos;s advantage in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
Hillary Clinton &apos;s former U.S. Foreign Minister continues to hold a two @-@ digit margin in the democratic race to nom@@ ination the nom@@ ination on national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders her face to the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has now received the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the presidential elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders grew second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
vice president Joe Bi@@ den who has not announced yet whether he is accredited for the presidential Office to receive assistance from 15 percent of the democratic voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion can be found on what candidates they will assist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supp@@ orter is in its choice as one of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ news survey , Clinton had lost some profit during some profit after demo@@ graphic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates ; but these high @-@ jumps have adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage in democratic voting under 50 years has evapor@@ ated and they are now on equal height .
Clinton has a big advantage over the older elec@@ tors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , Clinton was front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , which would be supported by enthusiasm Hillary Clinton would be nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some pre@@ ference , and a further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it was not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters have been impressed by all of her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are stronger at those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about one quarter would love them enthusias@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton , say less Republi@@ can voters over their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters in an open question is asked why they want that she has the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by the fact that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) too .
consent to deal with the problems and the voters will be quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Vice @-@ President raises the potential for the presidential guard in the balances , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though one third believes that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the democratic voters are asked of the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers more than half , that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the nomin@@ ee , Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s advantage will increase from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters want to see Clinton as a nomin@@ ee , with the best chances of winning it ; however , this figure decreased by 78 percent over the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is a second at this measurement , but the percentage that watches him as the &quot; sel@@ f@@ est &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for candidates , Democratic Vot@@ ers have questions about the voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for the voters turned out to be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates achieve good results in some important characteristics with elec@@ tors from the party elections .
Mehr@@ ing@@ us consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the top of the three candidates in hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters of the presidential elections usually see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ch@@ ide@@ ological according to their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all these measurements about a quarter of the Democratic Vot@@ ers has no opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since questions relating to Hillary Clinton &apos;s utili@@ zation and a server as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers will be pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came from the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that her mind has deterior@@ ated even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s mostly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 , who say that their views are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is viewed by the voters of her party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 % saw them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
62 percent of votes they do not hold for a honest and trusted person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the elec@@ tr@@ ums nation@@ ally see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good marks during guidance .
Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush will best fit in hon@@ esty of the six tested candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority does not see anything else than honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters during the period is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves at the national tour close to Donald Tr@@ ump .
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest of C@@ BS News / New York Times and Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two candidates already accounts for the half of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out before the Fox News Deb@@ ate last month and 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found that Car@@ son in demo@@ graphic groups is well received and l@@ ump in republi@@ can voters with higher education teachers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ isa , is hit at least 2 % with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ sc@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bug@@ fix for the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus , or Min@@ us 6 % , which was carried out in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son dates back to 19 % with the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the pump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump sharply in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view over one in the last week , Tr@@ ump took some hi@@ li@@ f@@ ters for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son had ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask for@@ ging faith in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are measured in distance only , a trip to the Mediterranean has enough to see warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no more to the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North Sea , the Baltic Sea , spl@@ its the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mediterranean @-@ temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic are at peak 25 degrees and in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ing bur@@ dened
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly two years after a student during a regular student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ che will be submitted to five persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood res@@ orted to Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tions ritual to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , divided the police with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he had been bur@@ dened with band@@ aged eyes with a 30 pound backpack @-@ filled with sand , and was repeated when he tried to listen to a frozen field on one goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about headache and then hum@@ bl@@ un@@ conscious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood called not the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g s@@ wo@@ oned and was report@@ edly waiting an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police took him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they had time to exchange D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the school began to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in his injuries next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a Autop@@ sy report , Den@@ g is repeated with bl@@ unt power of injuries to head , torso and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charge due to murder of the third count of the first five members .
two @-@ Thir@@ ty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g and accused of ar@@ dent attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make responsible persons responsible , but when there is an organization that - officially or in@@ formally - this is the case , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the br@@ otherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raising a rate of interest and the house is run in fuel , ren@@ ders for bonds are rising , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , how long it will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the economy offers only little guidance for the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor here as the economy and the financial investments are respon@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. bank under@@ scores that investors should not focus on increasing the interest rates , but rather during the time period , which is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several variables play a role in fact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , however , market participants could determine that the entire excitement maybe exagger@@ ated due to interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal high@@ s , but still at too low level to be to the seis@@ mic shock to bring many to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy may react :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the forec@@ ast@@ ening of interest rate causes things can volati@@ le for a while volati@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the impact is not so dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ated assets within 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study happening on the F@@ ed for interest in monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely in the past 35 years , the market has mostly been on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , causing Bob D@@ oll , Head of the Group strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks will later be increased , and its return will start to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest rates they often encourage them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the present case , the F@@ ed has faced some conditions which could not exist before and could speed up a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gross domestic product is extremely remarkable , so that the gross domestic product will be close to the F@@ ed for the lowest point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 countries had risen only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only a few months ahead of the Atlanta F@@ ed expects the third quarter to include only 1.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inser@@ tions in a frag@@ ile economic drop could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participation has made itself the whole year on a hill hike of the F@@ ed ; and all eyes were fixed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strategy and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could give an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all subsequent cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with the momentum of the GDP and on @-@ rec@@ essions , very rapidly , after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow rest from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession , and the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income was also volati@@ le , since the market takes a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase is made in the cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the raise cycle the bond yields were immediately falling - the Deutsche Bank said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strategy of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in closer and short bonds closer and close to the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ interest loans often bring better earnings in such a climate though , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ sti@@ n at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , increasing profitability is flat , lending volumes and volati@@ l@@ ity increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has sharp@@ ened its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in large and whole , companies involved in the larger part of their business activities in the USA will benefit from making interest rates and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debt are getting worse , since an increasing dollar concerns their products on the global market and likewise the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares ten@@ ds to react very positively to three months after initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts at a report to the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with strong balance sheet sur@@ passed companies with weak balance sheet as of 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with high capital yield and low volume equity at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest rates , Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consumers can also benefit from the rising dollar outside of the stock market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spar@@ k could see profits through higher earnings , even when experts are different , how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM who says CEO Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament became a member of the Parliament because of his &quot; stupid &quot;
it argu@@ ed that he is increasingly blur@@ red by commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also went at the BBC Music Awards , saying that she only im@@ ited the Br@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament College E@@ ien Coll@@ ins put the show The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns to Classic FM , says a leading member of Parliament , increasing new pressure on the station to prove that he does not do something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ories of MP Andrew B@@ ingham said to have said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ law radio radio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is increasingly blur@@ red by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; stupid &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM . &quot; he said .
he was also at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , will seem to be just under another name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously mentioned examples where you are actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC @-@ General director pointed out the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competi@@ tor if it comes to the public in live music and education .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 I &apos;ll learn about classical music nowhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and commissioned new works , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to engage and engage in the public , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 was however not the only element of BBC production that was under fire for the selection of culture , media and sport under fire , under fire , to pedal commercial ri@@ vals on feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MEP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins access The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you see , why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as the judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he would like the company &quot; a hit from our country @-@ country barn , &quot; when it was the next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or give money to the commission for other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Internet sales in August at slow@@ est and black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the lowest result since the record was recorded in 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones to go shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed its expenses in November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , this virtual shopping is bo@@ oming and many UK &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into extreme cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but experts say that there are signs of online sales that stagn@@ ates online , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the record of records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ates , after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , Andy mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y said , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G selling complex of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that the online sales were strengthened by three years ago , as buyer began to make purchases in their cell phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could shop online and could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now that comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon used by America is cited as a reason for the demand @-@ due revenues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , winner was five times the average number of buyers for their computer to bar@@ gain their bar@@ gains , and over@@ threw some dealer websites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , to which the buyer could hold the buyers , buyers , buyers , and buyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium figure out that £ 5 was issued a bit more than £ 1 online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people buys clothes and shoes online instead of in@@ putting into the inner city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims bury the Muslims in Mekka at crane accident victim - Bin Laden &apos;s family will sanc@@ tioned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead bodies of 29 victims are carried by Muslims in Mec@@ ca on the roads , born in Mec@@ ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia is laying down the collapse of part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered to be buried as 29 of the victims through the streets , killing those who were killed as a crane to Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ cked filled , deeply dressed in white , the distance to tender their respect , when the first of the dead sat down their last trip to the Al @-@ mo@@ a@@ jo@@ m Gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cession wound on the Holy Site , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then the praying collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of Bin Laden in the disaster , which had the 3@@ 94 injured , had a san@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 operators that were killed , when a crane was hit by the Great Central mo@@ ck of Mec@@ ca , was borne by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead were S@@ q@@ worm Ak@@ h@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , the father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage , when the crane over@@ thrown himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr A@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Carnival in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia is already saying that the H@@ add@@ sch goes to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to get to the city , will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group did not stop the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news agency &apos;s English intelligence agency has told this detail , but said that the leadership of the company out@@ law@@ ed abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ man was praised in early this week , causing the fall of the Cranes that collapsed in a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ z@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims left the H@@ add@@ sch who later took place in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the Royal Dec@@ ree was ad@@ ored the group because of no current security measures and because it did not collabor@@ ate with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes sur@@ round Mec@@ ca &apos;s big @-@ mosque as part of the massive building project that is headed by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and assumes greater building projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an Ab@@ d son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crash of the Cranes also came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government representative assigned that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to members of the killed and the same amount is the last one .
other injured ones will get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap East European ar@@ tis@@ ans is past
Brit@@ on employs increasingly ar@@ tis@@ ans ; says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe has a rise in
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to another 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim to aim for tra@@ des@@ people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales Exhibition nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City of chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that Br@@ its its h@@ amm@@ ers and pa@@ int@@ brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European ar@@ tis@@ ans , who perform works in their home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you sk@@ ill@@ fully handle a hammer or a brush to painting walls , it is now apparently a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because British focuses on increasing ar@@ tis@@ ans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique L@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her who has the DIY chain said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer services to deep prices is out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 additional screens can open to open tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 show@@ cases of B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said that she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop will be taken by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment the men were silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to place the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of males in our branches .
we have to move that into a balance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our clients consist of 80 percent of the decisions about buying items through women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a major role in making decision making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women listed on the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also structured their top team to reflect a same number of men and women in executive positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , occupying almost 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; This was a conscious decision - there is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year income before income , after the Group was utter@@ ed at the cost of the stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for trends the King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
function of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of fi@@ del@@ ity in trial
at the District Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday there have to be responsible for two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of del@@ ity and dis@@ car@@ ding education .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them had also been indicted for abuse .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postp@@ oned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ober@@ sta@@ ate Robert Ri@@ ffel , in 2006 , the accused were cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the def@@ endants were not allowed to display societies in their functions until 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results will be reimbur@@ sed to about 400@@ .000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also being ar@@ ra@@ cted for financial passing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact , however , expi@@ red by the President of the archipelago , by Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence believed that the association was not created at any time by an heritage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports@@ men would have been expecting and pay the sports club for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and in whom they had invested a lot of time and money , with the Pas@@ si@@ va equ@@ alled some 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back then we stood in front of the situation : do we further stop or lock the club ? &quot; is one of the def@@ endants in the bread department of the financial department .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we had the money we had laid down our life insurance as a security at the bench , &quot; he said during the entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , only debts may be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the payout of the compensation expense was to be st@@ acked until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the allowance was given only years after , when a plus on the account has been paid out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also included l@@ ump and un@@ detailed bookings . refer to the former ob@@ s@@ ob@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and savings accounts managed the two def@@ endants jointly , while the second def@@ endants said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why the club &apos;s payments were not disclosed in detail then the judge affir@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the financial impact , just as the debt crisis has been , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when in 2011 , an amount of over 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were the def@@ endants , explained the def@@ endants .
this securities account expi@@ red on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not acqu@@ ainted with the association according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
for a long time the interview was asked no answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he thought finally , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something happened to him , no one would have knew anything of that money , the prosecutor dropped in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accused had informed himself the function@@ ary of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim of damage . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? they refused to know judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first def@@ endant , however , did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never incur@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; all of you are all from the hook . &quot;
&quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the function@@ ary , he never gra@@ b@@ bed a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on F@@ AD di@@ eting the club was charged 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort had been much higher than he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accused could not show accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were dis@@ counted after an operation , in which everything has been judged correctly , explained not more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all jo@@ st@@ eries are in cash , with whom he must travel from his place of international law to the bank to lead in Abi@@ d@@ burg , he stated in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard expands another 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the ongoing deficit reduction , the computer giant has further jobs in the company &apos;s re@@ deployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no end positions to the positions at the US Computer @-@ Computer H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within its restructuring , the US @-@ technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its clients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the costs will be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the move will lead to a special loading of around $ 2.7 billion , which will start from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disman@@ t@@ ling of 5@@ 5.000 jobs in the past three years is not yet completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
retro@@ listed was the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share 2.3 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large group based in California Palo Alto , the computer and printing business , is now converted to a new society - separate from the se@@ minal areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a more dis@@ appointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate clients followed the world &apos;s second largest PC producer to Lenovo .
sales of PC and printers grew by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of financial year .

the revenues go back from 16 quarters in 15 quarters .
HP answered with a spl@@ its and massive positions on change in the industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted to buy smartphones and tablets instead of common computers , and do more and more businesses with it online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Whit@@ mans re@@ lin@@ ation plans for a total of about 55@@ ,000 jobs in total .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would however mainly agree to ref@@ using : 54 percent had agreed that 35 percent had agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other countries fly air@@ strikes to the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent found positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 percent are on the contrary to engage in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with the Syrian ruling , Bashar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of respon@@ dents would be 20 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border on R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tr@@ ash and water designer against several hundred injured refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent collapse at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind that a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was ready to use a f@@ row@@ er .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones and plastic bottles after the official .
the officials were initially cra@@ ck@@ ling pepper spray .
thereafter the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of lac@@ ri@@ as was contra@@ sted in the direction of refugees .
the group was thus dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have withdrawn a bit now .
a pregnant woman and obviously injured woman was removed from the zone .
children that had met the tr@@ ash before .
other refugees sack@@ cloth in themselves and suffered under breath pressure .
the police force of the Serbian police suffered injury through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of interest over interest rates for US emergency bank
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is watching when the U.S. emergency bank is coming together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , the interest can be raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists , which were assessed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist and the interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed Interest has set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach the situation where a large central bank will leave the zero range , and a process of norm@@ alizing interest rates will begin with the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is based on relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less massive view on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets for an increase in order , but the evidence suggests that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 : 00 CET on Thursday
causes of death at the Delta State University leave sorry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after casting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot up his colleagues later day , Sh@@ annon wrote a note that he had made it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb told the staff of the emergency call , that the police must be re@@ printed in his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &apos; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but nobody can &apos;t b@@ other , but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb has no explanation for his kis@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could even und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday night when the police captured him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said that he got nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something said in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ but@@ ler relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was created by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en that said they were married for about seven years and described as a &quot; good man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a daughter , which is 19 , and it was &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were her daughter &apos; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s served online from home and according to statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s who had a dog called Light@@ ning that had met up for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had called up to a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a polic@@ eman approached the highway 1 near Green@@ ville to one night , Lamb ran his car to the side , fled to the forest and killing himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was received from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , and a doctorate obtained from the university &apos;s website in spring 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convicted of drug discovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this requires your tribute .
Eu@@ rosci@@ ence : Lufthansa is building the trust
Lufthansa is planning a large group of Group transformation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the year , the Lufthansa Group will save alone with a better organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 150 of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the workplace .
there is no new negotiations with the pilot training .
Lufthansa is setting up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ level new@@ row@@ ings .
the goal of the real@@ ignment offers an annual contribution of around 500 million euros a year from cost and earnings syn@@ ergi@@ es on Wednesday .
among other things there will be no executive board for passenger business in the Lufthansa future .
the low @-@ aircraft f@@ row@@ ings should be developed as much as possible .
managing board of CEO Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for eu@@ char@@ ings in the Karl Ulrich Bei@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of eu@@ pping , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the organisation of the 120 000 employees was strong .
airlines fly under the roof of the passage Air@@ line group which represents three quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tari@@ q conflict , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court hear@@ ted strike on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this divided the union .
topic of talks should be the turn@@ key control for pilots .
cockpit wants to come in a year with a projected record result &quot; as soon as possible to viable results .
the conflict between Union and Air@@ line led to a different strike in recent months .
background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background supply , the pilots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fore@@ seen that Lufthansa in battle against competitors arriving at the group &apos;s own low @-@ minded cli@@ row@@ ings will be located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months for a double fac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w at the Champions League defeat of Manchester with PS@@ V Eindhoven a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this brought the left qu@@ ender for wines and exclu@@ de him from playing for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was inserted into the PS@@ V area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes on the field , and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double gas@@ ket and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps a day later and operated in Manchester .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very difficult and then perform terri@@ fic , and then happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the changing cub@@ icle he had an oxygen mass@@ aging .
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fl@@ frac@@ ture , it will last six months , and will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have a red map and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er and has not punished the Mexican guy .
van Ga@@ al thought that the Italian arbit@@ er had not mistaken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that a eleven @-@ meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery is now , I come back stronger again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which is related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the European Championship in France , the England advoc@@ ate has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Phillip Coc@@ u as the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said : &quot; there &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves this kind of injury to place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , it is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it wasn &apos;t possible to see the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball coming down in another direction was that it had been touched as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly does David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite child@@ r@@ ens book was decided to visit the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which came from Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message to the company of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , touching , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book which I would like to give up a picture or message which we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all well and good , except for the following paragraph , said in Cameron said to reflect a description of the film version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to enhance the fairly short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ id@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ em @-@ Ville , where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y has been fulfilled , his real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and died in 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if this is not susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron doesn &apos;t work well , like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is designed and even the air is a commodity , hoping to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he is to be able to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the action of the book by walking , trees , thro@@ po@@ unding lau@@ rel , &quot; that is , in the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , that The Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times in a row with a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come from the Camer@@ ata Elec@@ toral Office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at the exit from England &apos;s squ@@ ad but it &apos;s still hard
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having pushed Pakistan to the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res , the UK for the tour , is a repe@@ tition of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series failure not on my card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a reverse victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ks site is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ ups in the battle and the Community spirit is strong ; they will not bear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ball develops as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this word @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th complet@@ es from the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course great to analyze as its head coach in York@@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ers are focused on results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I have told this to make players their own best selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long time ago , the run was extended by Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when hopefully further runs out for York@@ shire it will bring another chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t give so good performances , and this did not surprise me ; he is primarily a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man gets to set his character is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Comp@@ ton gets the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation , which you can lay up was that England was first made in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alex H@@ ales came in and he is a bu@@ zz@@ ing who I sets up highly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , which we saw at York@@ shire early in this season as he achieved a position 2@@ 36 on a tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must collect at least the same opportunities as those before him , but of course it depends on the team line in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea , mos@@ ques next to Cook suggest , which would generate an extra spin @-@ punch and four quot@@ as would be released , and I have nothing against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a b@@ ats@@ man couldn &apos;t punch there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious dam of cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ een may not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s not a number 3 for her and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop in 2001 before coming up as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred vines straight away and did not look back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second man Ans@@ ari comes to the ca@@ ster as a back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited view he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no big number of backup tra@@ des@@ men who kno@@ cks their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some smart additions at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ di and the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est score of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is responsible for the white ball stage of the tour , bringing energy and powerful use into the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights of which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in changing rooms , even though the messages are in line with the previously forec@@ asted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham is not used with Dur@@ ham and Ben St@@ okes and won &apos;t have a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree but Co@@ aches and team performances do not determine the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that as with players , their jobs will depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ xit camps ( Bre@@ xit = Aus@@ se Great Britain from the EU ) could reach Zul@@ u , the economy could reach a F@@ lau@@ te in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
David Cameron &apos;s Un@@ balanced new negoti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day and without the election of the brilliant nam@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who was strongly viol@@ ently broke off in Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ acy group , voc@@ ally said that some member states , have deeply dist@@ ressed in various crises , as the EU is now created and un@@ disturbed sexual changes which they mostly not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not matter if they compromise social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers have risen to sum@@ mits or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies to reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes for looking outside the UK in the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; L@@ ass us alone , says that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s war@@ dent German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been the power for 10 years before it looks good for them as it has been doing so far as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 14 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
French François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or its implementation in 2017 .
he is also a released force .
Poland possibly has a nation@@ alistic right government and Spain one left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are helping to tear down a leg to prevent the Sel@@ fie Br@@ its from the UK , something they should not want it , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , some such ministers may sometimes do not imp@@ ly any helpful comments , while the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was &quot; Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain did not win anything from the new trial . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europeans know how to be aware of the Fle@@ et Street at its expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , but did not have the beginning of 1973 when he supported it with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sten , who made itself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ber Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all his promises Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ y countries and p@@ seudo non @-@ in@@ ders included most of our major newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir had similar about her , but stood firmly that if you spend with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you will get better ban@@ anas to get him away instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it was more Bla@@ iri@@ aner as Bla@@ ir himself , because Bla@@ ir had refused the principle of the Constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press has never forgiven him for this .
but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cla@@ p on the back in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to suc@@ cum@@ ber@@ y to the 80 @-@ s strategy of repe@@ ating a mistake at that time and today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may take but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC couch has left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I put it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ble trend and the wild cin@@ emat@@ ography of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ English can probably say Yes to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns became appointment of provo@@ king John McDon@@ nell as the Chancellor of the Chancellor John McDon@@ nell ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminds me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father continued to work on television to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and lose his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Stru@@ g@@ gle was still more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight , in order to remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ i expressed - this was not what McDon@@ nell said about what J@@ C told his colleagues and dep@@ u@@ ties on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up Image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to tell me that he has even touched me - news and remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the ma@@ el@@ strom of the social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allow him to help Lab@@ ours support in a matter of course , like McDon@@ nell Douglas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but McDon@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are basic am@@ big@@ u@@ ity to EU membership - in line with its lead its lead under the left dissi@@ pation , whose anti @-@ capitalist past is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with his am@@ big@@ u@@ ties to NATO - Tom Watson is fel@@ sen@@ ing convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will try to try to find proper sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin w@@ asted political capital , they have also susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if things can be po@@ int@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government on the power where the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum was called on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze the public health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking , originated from a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who are writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , surrendered to the Government of Public Health in England ( P@@ he ) in her report about e @-@ cigarettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; Basic Law &quot; last month , and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but some researchers have questioned the strength of their data , and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lanc@@ et &apos;s medical journal , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &quot; seized by the P@@ he his main conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two further researchers write BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on efficacy evidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public is expected to asser@@ t that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking , at a detailed review of documentation and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this testimony comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to introduce their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis . the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting offered a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , the president of British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report they said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants stated on the meeting was to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he report@@ edly received from tobacco companies Philip Morris International , added to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for the selection of the committee are not delivered , but include several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which include a number of domain financing in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco leadership of P@@ he participated .
the research work of the group &quot; is indic@@ ative that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most crit@@ eri@@ ons &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that the claims of P@@ he , that &quot; there has been no proof , that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and well@@ being of P@@ he , said that on the claims of BM@@ J has already been re@@ acted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggested that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are small compared to that , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is occupied and what not , especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative dangers as compared to the tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 80,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clear instructions of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should quit East@@ En@@ ders and says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give in their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square so@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for the fact that they are openly seen in public law , which probably can be seen by a smaller audience in a hard disputed time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals such as BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to come in touch with the BBC for six years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be commissioned , or sent it clearly by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fees , what I do mean in the middle or long term , you should at least put his production on programmes that will not make or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they send The Voice in an exec@@ ellent time@@ frame because they want to achieve a broad support for the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive operating tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly contain both self @-@ productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ estly other can@@ als would give their right arm for it .
I strive to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , directed a entrepren@@ eur for series production , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the ambi@@ tions of people who work there because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of BBC will give back what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Book lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal NGOs would go to BB@@ C4 but they can argue , but they can be argu@@ ing if they have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put it in a time@@ frame in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcasting fees , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for people who are worth £ 150 a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , as they are not consumed so much from the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said in front of the committee on Tuesday said that the BBC should check their mission for the mission to form and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of the BBC &apos;s production was officially classified as a formation - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio , and it should change to the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television is going to go online and make it available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ oc@@ e@@ &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ at@@ oc@@ ytes go the direction in that moment , in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by ben@@ ches of sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny Nem@@ at@@ oc@@ ytes change the direction at the moment , in which they have as high frequencies for the human ear , which are to be punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impul@@ ses work by switching to Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , that are genetically modified to react the membrane channels , react on ultras@@ onic waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers also said that worms showed the power of a new method , called son@@ o@@ ds , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thread ret@@ ards do not act on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani pointed that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then inv@@ ade the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structure that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
sound waves can effect the opening of these ion channels and activate cells which they are assigned to Nature Communications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms that carry some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ gens TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he turns ultras@@ onic to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ pu@@ ffs and turn into worms that turn down mot@@ ion@@ ised mot@@ ion@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ . , a ground@@ breaking tool enabling scientists to activate neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ata could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to light , which has to be reduced to a optical fiber to the desired passage in the brain , low frequency ult@@ ran@@ oise @-@ shaft tissues may occur un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that creating a therapy and a therapeutic virus is enabled , the approached human neur@@ ons are vulnerable to making ultrasound signal for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin production cells . he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : drive from September 15 to 18 September with D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the D@@ LR line which turns into the image of a pin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , a s@@ warm of arms trade with D@@ LR ... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used the Ad Space H@@ ack Packs , a 6 £ -@@ pack of bus@@ bar shut@@ down , which claim to gain access to around one third of bus stops on the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work out of the audience outside of galleries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists make their work within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside in the real world , so that their art has an influence on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Am@@ nesty video has been viewed on Facebook for more than 100,000 times and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , the non @-@ profit organization with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ over @-@ artists who works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed about the silence that was around advertising for the weapons event - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic v@@ ambi@@ valent corporate culture , but &quot; more intense &quot; through the background with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made a fantastic job by helping us to def@@ use awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step forward by the British Government , and the guarantee that fo@@ ols cannot be traded in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the weapons event comes from within the range of Excel , where exhibitors w@@ alled fantastic eu@@ ph@@ istic products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful of students in a student residence , but now I remember the strained smile of those that I have put on - and on the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of which I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student dormit@@ ories is enough of slightly ner@@ ge@@ tic to an absolutely terri@@ fying way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to gos@@ sip : people tell where you come from where you come from and where you can &apos;t really love Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in serious , guys , it is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe in through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find the people you may not speak to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were in the fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ isher would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people die .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms of people often transform themselves into beverages arrangements , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people attract people and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is related to : don &apos;t remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a room @-@ to @-@ room w@@ bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allow you to tell you : &quot; I like you , and I want to go back , but you must go out to get the energy back I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send SMS to a SMS instead of .
apro@@ pos the way : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you start the university at the point of back @-@ mania , the kno@@ ck is closer to the doors of people to introduce less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to close friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your mates will feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself , and will associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
naturally you depend on whether you are a decent ch@@ cker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; badly missed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping , when you kno@@ ck down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an eternal crime of student residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a ste@@ aling , but does it take a drop of Mil@@ king for your tea too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check it with the milk owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chances are good that they say to self @-@ service , even if they cook inside the interior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone claims your stuff is that anno@@ y@@ ingly , and you have my sympathy - but try to treat more balanced as my fellow worker who added her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is in prison now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not make any noise , anno@@ y the people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being an independent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the human being sitting in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl in my way asked their neighbours , whether it makes them something more quiet , drum &amp; bass is somewhat more quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they acted with still loud music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she finally heard around 5 in the morning , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she shut up their own music and went to her three hour test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would it not be Roman@@ tic when your future partner would im@@ print randomly in the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be ab@@ us@@ ely embarrass@@ ing if you have a co @-@ resident for your future wife to take a look and see them every day , how long will they bring together all our common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the heart is his own way - but when a hot tub is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to speak a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment , in which you can notice that someone has its keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a bo@@ k and bul@@ lying f@@ one , as it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good quest is funny but it takes just moments until he becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give through a precious and am@@ using lesson on security - but never send someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lock her door , and place her keys in a glass of water , then place it in the freezer , but put their dom@@ inions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terra@@ ced houses for refugees who are engaged in a single company
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a lot of money in the mid @-@ Fran@@ ces Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only mother and the Ger@@ sh@@ ofen company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how to buy and build today ... &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old interview
thousands of refugees are recru@@ ited on the domestic market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowledge , how quickly the living room can be created : he builds for refugees in a project for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner and many refugees are heading for the housing markets .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : a massive accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great part .
considering the refugee flow we require sufficient living space in the next decades .
a ban@@ qu@@ ant , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a dancing house needs less space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
it is different if you put the people in blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses , which are built just in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every living unit has two bedrooms and a bathroom and a lounge and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be changed easily after each needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square metres of living space per house is € 184 000 euros .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the building took six months .
this is reasonable .
did the construction work complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have legally moved my project correctly .
it is especially complicated by the threatening line of dam@@ s and the parking space .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will still sub@@ ordin@@ ates who creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house ?
g@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who gave me accused of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but are you ag@@ grav@@ ated in the competition to affordable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true is however : we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but the luxury apartments were hardly able to afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my project has the message that even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees but also the alone M@@ um or the Ger@@ sh@@ ofen company .
I am showing how to buy and build today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple released is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by launching the App Store , select &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s ready , the phone provides the option to download and install it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered even after installing problems , since they receive an error message that is issu@@ ing the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack is reset or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space , but Apple has more likely to do so by adding it to Apple when you insert a special tool using apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worth to make sure your cell phone is charged during actu@@ alization , or is located near a charging tool , so that the battery is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple cannot be said that the update may be stopped , as the phone may turn on half paths and this could lead to a breakdown of the updates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago , Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; has recorded yet another member of his ranks , and the number of members increased to 19 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess player and tennis player who held himself more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the vehicle of the Federal Reserve 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which received Alfred Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus it is possible to record chess players , which cannot perform membership dues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
youth work and job search should also be driven .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contacts to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as the expression of its connection with the spa town .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely many benefits of the insur@@ ers are not being taken away because the complexity of insur@@ ances will hardly be understood as well as responsible for the Anton@@ ini and the citizens Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to the deliber@@ ations the new Qu@@ arti@@ s office offers prevention , health care and wellness .

men checked on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witness the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ oral : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ oral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point the group was at the level of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also 3 people on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now cried with the young people , and smote this with his fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al cra@@ tic and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when his two friends were rus@@ hed and ended up on the rac@@ quet , his victims suffered from his victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last young man was moved home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their flat and drove past several hundred years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we saw the vehicle more , the last one was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there he was attacked again by the rac@@ quet and another male person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under conditions of an obst@@ acle , one was tested on the face and th@@ ig@@ h of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller on the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
furthermore we are also looking forward to di@@ vin@@ ist mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , who promoted U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places on the land are missing Doc@@ tors - As@@ endorf , however , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is reti@@ ring on his successor in the next few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened his practice on 12 October again , up until then he is investing 3@@ 10000 euros into the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy to the first sight when the Fel@@ ste@@ aus@@ ing was met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , which is currently completed in practice in the German hospital and is coming to practice later year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was done I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea of operating the own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old m@@ iller .
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage he see also his own boss .
and so one became lon@@ ely and the gar@@ bage got the home with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen - Vil@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a two @-@ time family father Frank Müller raised up in several medical practices in Hanover , and also in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is currently working as an assistant in Sul@@ ingen in 2009 , and in 2009 he was appointed a Senior Physi@@ cian in the Di@@ ep@@ wood district and is held on voluntary in DR@@ K @-@ read@@ iness Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ er works as a physician , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) has specialized on Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land@@ fills and both inter@@ ni@@ sts and want to settle down as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after conversion the rooms are modern look .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ term loading and loading EK@@ Gs and need a language room more .
the system is also completely renewed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a subsi@@ dy of € 50@@ 000 ( € 25@@ 000 per person ) and the municipality of the municipality ( 12,@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12,@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are in practice that the practice is continued . &quot; explains Sam@@ t@@ gener@@ a bourgeois @-@ bourgeois Bernd Bor@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ ad , about 2000 patients arrive in the practice of Fel@@ ast@@ ausen , in the North German average group there are about 500 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another house general practice .
a positive side effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the village of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found she would have gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , those who go to Müll@@ ers , will continue to be kept in familiar faces : he will assume the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their departure at As@@ endorf , after all , the medical doctors have practiced 30 years there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms &quot; reminds you of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
a little melanchol@@ y feel it after the long time already .
&quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients surely yet . &quot; says the intern@@ ist .
her husband is refreshing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter @-@ space . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always been pushed against gardening but it could be otherwise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to the parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before it is clear that everyone wants to ask a asylum application , can also &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and security of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows as well as the Austrian @-@ Slov@@ ene border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering the corridor &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is denied
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would go ahead for future refugees towards Austria and Germany , and also cor@@ ridors to refugees too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this did not look at the Minister of Interior in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is as an outside edge of the Schengen area already very contro@@ l@@ dly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Minister of Minister , Slovenian plans to conf@@ use his limits for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system will not work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees tried to travel on Tuesday in the night @-@ hours at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian police tried them to reach in the near corn fields .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars will constantly meet new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about Syrians and Afghan , including many women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country is about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , carried out to the Hungarian border so far , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade is , however , that it is the way people like to identify certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor will we do this , &quot; it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , anyway , a first bus with some 50 refugees came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the course of the day , further buses would expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria on Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ mates were the whole night of the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has agreed , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it could actually be a forec@@ asted shift from the present Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece to Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a bit further west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously st@@ resses that his country for the fall of a strong str@@ ust of refugees have prepared plans for possible damages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not name details , but he pointed to that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive capabilities for crossing the border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one quote rigor@@ ous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have consistently seen a good witness , as concerns the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ ade au@@ n .
according to the media reports she spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border , it is un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Serbian Minister of Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm on Wednesday at a local eye for refugees , after the Hungarian border is now shut down , for early days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would not be a very high refugee camps .
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or a different country .
advise migrants - hazardous - Alternative
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute land maps on which alternative routes are classified by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still no cleared mine fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team was sent by mine clear@@ ers in the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market exchange @-@ h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als who have been thrown out to have been reviewed yet again in un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR news@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information carriers were to be made to the financial markets with the necessary information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , in total , the investigations were awarded a total of over 100 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders must ultimately be tra@@ pped , &quot; said it in S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case against 32 further fittings in the case was di@@ gest@@ ed .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are supposed to be uni@@ tised both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce camp in Mannheim has been operating for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz is the business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people carry out their expectations , partly quick de ste@@ es , partly comfortably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you control the stations of the Mannheim Autos@@ al@@ on at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ sing , rest@@ less life with stunning autumn sun and thick , four big boards each with the title &quot; Before I die , I die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce has attentive to its 20th anniversary and is absolutely faced with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is all life , so we went with the campaign in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce help stands for questions and discussions at their disposal as the volunteer staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some serious action is spontaneous to the chal@@ k and the sentence around &quot; my life saving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop the war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or not so far I &apos;m not &quot; and go further then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again , on the ver@@ ge small discussions develop across the action , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also just a site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I &apos;m sure that the end of the world comes to me at any time , &quot; says director of the di@@ ac@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ er with the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore this public @-@ effective campaign was good for the 20 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate openly in the tables let it understand@@ able , finally , handle it a very personal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of death and dying was still def@@ icient in the years before with Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement has done much in recent years to open the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ and@@ roid .
the death and funeral service belongs to the honorary positions of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when faced with personal experience using the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was searching for an official call , she immediately reported herself and had been present in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ dd@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected people and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce St Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ and@@ roid can be combined well with her task and the experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another warning , it &apos;s precious to precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of an ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical wai@@ st@@ shop is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial support of the insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations facilit@@ ates training as well as training and super@@ visions of the death and funeral service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every two years training is offered for new employees .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ appoint results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant confirms its earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his Bo@@ d@@ transport service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the firm also said that she plans to recru@@ it approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for their vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to take hold of 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. agreed to earn a $ 10,@@ 40 dollar profit in the financial year , which will end in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts expect after a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower view proceeds in spite of the price increases , aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent and , despite the higher supplements for soil transfers from heavy and large packages which will be raised from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it was still anticipated that the result opposite the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and because of growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will deliver solid earnings , considering the weaker yet anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for vac@@ ancies have been announced a day later than the rival UPS , who is planning to stop 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , about the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million donated $ 6@@ 92 million over the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research compl@@ ains analysts predi@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked the analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decrease in international priority shipping to stagn@@ ated sales in his unit express mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices due to higher working costs in the cargo business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares will be $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the most anticipated meeting in the years Federal Reserve performed two days this week at a 27 @-@ foot @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
threatening above them at an end of the ver@@ ted , two @-@ storey seat sa@@ id@@ al there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and her colleagues need to set the economic interests of the nation , before all other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Bank has received a second @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices stable , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed Leader has recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this third party could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to fore@@ see it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to we@@ aned by the un@@ preced@@ ented interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the economy show that they are solid , the latest turbul@@ ence at the global financial markets will ampli@@ fy these volati@@ l@@ ity by the abo@@ lition of interest to bonds , and be it just around a quarter percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing in which they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief of chief econom@@ ist Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , the increased in@@ security is enough to maintain the global market enough , &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which secu@@ res himself the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , which were advised recently from Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a interest rate this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the financial markets are expecting an agreement of the F@@ ed with a key Indi@@ c@@ ator representing a 30 % chance for increasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strategy suggests a blow by their promise that further increase is far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average was at 2@@ 8,@@ 89 points or 1,4 % at 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy held the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this point , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , it would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they should not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argue that interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would deal more uncertainty when the F@@ ed would deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence of 0.@@ 25 percentage points to this month , the first small step in a slow disappearance of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the spring and early summer of summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest has been around seven years and close to the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets all over the world were added to the end of the month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average earned more than 16 % among its high level , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten the global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the Dow now saving nearly 10 % below the rise of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation of the market where one should increase interest rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events were not performed on financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. State Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he tells us that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty regarding what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data which describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main ones in F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically during decision making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere notice of the former conductor Ben S. Bern@@ ad@@ joined in 2013 , that the F@@ ed gave their monetary expansion &quot; close &quot; with turbul@@ ence around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are to be imp@@ ec@@ tom@@ less , the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives can be met with other central banks and experts who can also get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements which apparently cannot be linked to the economic foundation data . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ pper , vocal member of the Federal Open Market Committee , indicated for a interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia delivered the F@@ ed to reduce its mark by 0.9 percentage points in three sessions , despite a limited impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives made this cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should put on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market leader in 2008 , former member of the Committee for interest closure of the Bank of England stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recent turbul@@ ence doesn &apos;t come close to that level . he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to put into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest rate , because the markets aw@@ akes up , &quot; P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should fore@@ face time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little life help for refugees
there are always more refugees in Germany for these days .
to prepare a warm welcome does not work without the engagement of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
she still likes to do with her 74 lum@@ bers .
every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is quite different classes than at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande promoting healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SP@@ RS &apos;s Brazilian organization is trying to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during a breast@@ feeding time . you are doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are painted with represent@@ ations of unusual foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which require babies all the nutrients you need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment which should be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet did indeed affect the genes of their baby and protects them from developing tum@@ ours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately a un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2,3 million euro area .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited gym in the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports area is moving forward by step : in the latest general meeting , the excav@@ ation work was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to this , the committee had decided to apply a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; , it was possible to permit a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a roof @-@ roof is set to be built with a non @-@ not@@ ch first and roof top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the planned use of roof@@ ers for solar plants : &quot; this means we got a wonderfully large south @-@ roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberation movement , in turn , went to be prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is greatly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the pen@@ sion@@ ment is not &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der community is usually referred to as a case for exemp@@ li@@ zation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when Turn@@ halle began , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create any preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports hall division at the sports center is a community project between the community and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at cost .
grants are expected from the school and la@@ titude promotion .
the building application for the 18 x 36 metre area will now be presented to the landing page for the trial .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees are moving by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with Be@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was confirmed by the surprising plans by the Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one decision about the meeting is to the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ ini@@ ening next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans should be implemented , then all of the almost 50 employees would continue to work at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of them should move with fishermen and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in W@@ eil@@ heim , the staff , who can not be offered with ju@@ g@@ au , shall be offered a work@@ space in W@@ eil@@ heim , as well as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic until the beginning of the year and is now transfer@@ ed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the question who is to succeed , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; went into play , who prepared to take over the line and change his team to Be@@ ong@@ au on 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was a &quot; recovery &quot; and a wider range of services in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next two years Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to offering both houses , which has still more than 35 beds , should be finally closed after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the District band had planned this for 2018 , when the current restoration of the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital is concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , represented rum@@ ours that the House , which is owned by the Federal Office , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close my sleep . as with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are currently a short @-@ term treatment of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ haz@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric Dis@@ orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; so Fischer has been res@@ ett@@ led by the W@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch who had been positively received by the employees &quot; positive and understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective on the house , whose fishermen have been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital , formerly known as 100 beds ) over the past few decades , was threatened with shut@@ down , such as the surgery and birth@@ days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Lou@@ d@@ ons are required tonight at the age of Berg@@ isches HC .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal the clear favorite . reason for the sec@@ rec@@ y man there is none .

Jag@@ ger case with two injured during Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tra@@ ctor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn afternoon on Tuesday afternoon through shots .
during the Aber@@ deen on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( county of Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters have been in use as the police cleared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a shot down , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought into hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident was un@@ clear .
police Police determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
a crime @-@ susp@@ ect has led the police for the ly@@ re of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
inter@@ ro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was inter@@ ro@@ gation to the young people and her body to have thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one has fallen on the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for violent crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body of young woman was found at the Tuesday evening at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosecutor and police informed on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a supp@@ or@@ tive one also , on Tuesday evening he took over 20 year old who , indeed , led the disclosure and investig@@ ators to the site of the o@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning , after having arrived at the evening after a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in search of young woman , investig@@ ators initially beat personal subjects from the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of surveys on the circle of friends and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances we got a crime @-@ suspici@@ on against the 20 year olds .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the official accepted , according to that of the police , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the glue applied to the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be taken to the port on Wednesday . investig@@ ators pay him to a burden .
conclusion of the closer circumstances of the fact should bring further investigations .
refugees need properties : study warns of apartment gap
the location on the German apartment market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek an affordable place .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution programmes on the German property market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more people are pushing onto a market that has already been over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to un@@ cover the demand for affordable housing , they would have to build 400@@ ,000 new units from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study results on behalf of the alliance &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
for comparison : in Germany there are 26@@ 0.000 units ready .
the estimated 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of her stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many encounter in the home market and lines up in the long queu@@ es for the apartments .
according to the Federal Office in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers have been registered .
however the negative development of the housing market is not only in the rising refugee camps .
the study also has considerable failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is a public deficit set in front of itself . this year it becomes bigger from year to year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , some 77@@ ,000 houses were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , advis@@ ing Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so many professionals were living in large cities as well as WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willing to stand up voluntarily in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capita in previous years has declined again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incen@@ tives should support the social housing construction again .
thus the property tax could be avoided and the basic tax for subsi@@ dised flats has been exposed .
an alliance of attractive tax @-@ condition@@ ally need to be necessary .
the programme for refugee measures from the Kf@@ W State Bank wins already well in cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the launch , a 184 million euros had already been sum@@ mon@@ ed on Monday evening with € 184 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia the corridor a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungary , practically no enforcement is required , since more refugees are choosing on Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
nevertheless the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to negoti@@ ate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Slovenian Minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already a member of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the German television channel RT@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , coming up the same day in power , translate this extraordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there were people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police took part in the Serbian border on the Serbian border to the EU @-@ neighbouring country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of our media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came together with the bus and the Ta@@ xes in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately upon arrival , they had tried to reach on foot across the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees don &apos;t viol@@ ate Gren@@ ob@@ ä@@ une .
for this the border of other dangers poses : there are no sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers should quickly establish a safe passage rapidly .
after Hungary come after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 cont@@ ested people .
shortly before the decision on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian enforcement stages the bri@@ ghtening and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as criminal off@@ ence .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian mar@@ ginal city of Sz@@ eged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the convicted fi@@ anc@@ é was sentenced to five years , and deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the information provided by the Immig@@ ration Authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers were created on Tuesday , including almost all - 93 - at the most important junction R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants , 13 families with young children and two older men are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning there could be even 40 refugees .
but practically no one has a view to be granted in Hungary .
the Hungarian view is a &quot; safe Third Land . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
before the &quot; Tran@@ qu@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke a few hundred migrants were gathered .
the workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collected the gar@@ bage , which tens of thousands of people in the past weeks on the road@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the nearby @-@ door wareh@@ ouses in the bor@@ der@@ ort have been rebuilt .
no one wanted to express the finishing of this structure .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
in Salzburg some 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
there are regularly smaller groups of refugees in Freil@@ assing .
mayor drove &quot; Gest@@ ures &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the stor@@ ero@@ sion when suddenly ten people were standing with rice off@@ ences at the entrance of the tent , &quot; as W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany had surprising his escape on Sunday because of the refugee stream with Austria , it was once more appropriate for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , who immediately had his aid and the cars crossed the border to the Middle Pas@@ sau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before we first trusted the guests only with gos@@ sip and drinks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we said right now , we bring them to Pas@@ sau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of course for us to be a city in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy &quot; even so Stad@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected train papers were transferred on Sunday evening at a ICE in a regional train direction Pas@@ sau , after the announcement of the railway traffic to Germany after the short notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the regional train was transferred from the border to W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably staged daily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án again sends many tens of thousands to us , a logical conclusion is of a holy politics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of being able to help in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke construction of structures immediately , our Federal Chancellor has officially strengthened the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ ony of National Soci@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only those Austri@@ ans are among the Austri@@ ans , which are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the whis@@ pers will have to say that the &quot; praised country &quot; , which she invited and welcomed us , has nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge , in view of sustained activity flows and coming winter to produce decent conditions for ground@@ breaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search of 3@@ 5.000 permanent Quar@@ ts
Konrad has full to do with the refugees of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used that his word has weight .
the government was used to deplo@@ y the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to shed light for thousands of refugees .
Konrad already has a grip on the chaos of the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen School of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen ! &quot; he reported by his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came on Monday to Austria is without a big vort@@ ex , and Konrad , and praised the organizational one to the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Home spoke of a &quot; a ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altogether , Konrad incorpor@@ ates a demand of 8@@ 5,000 molecules in the he@@ ur@@ ed year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to fulfill the number , more than € 35@@ ,000 have to be found in the next weeks - 20.000 people are to provide the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without bottom , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held discussions with the governor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these could have secured him , even to create quota for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who shall be cau@@ tious as the Church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asylum also deals with asylum applications in the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot;
we can offer private individuals with complicated accommodation on the platform .
this is what you &apos;d be hoping to stay empty in winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier reviewed the standards for placing as &quot; very high &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that the artist &apos;s ampl@@ ers have to hold a certain height of the towel holders or size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; emergency standard would have to apply for a temporary period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in placing Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am an older gentle@@ man I cannot speak without further in the face of truth .
persu@@ ader is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier will not cause the Republic to cause them as self explained .
they want to increase their head@@ count on three to four .
the own qu@@ antum look has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on st@@ ep@@ han@@ splatz as office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
there is no opening of urban sports hall and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees to the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since one could not subject to those concerned without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an emergency , more sites are to be tested on their suit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criticism from the head of the town head to the allocation of refugees within the Bundes@@ land .
other areas must also make their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone with the Bavarian Minister of Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) the governor Josef P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) has ac@@ corro@@ bor@@ ated the further procedure in the refugee issue on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the further trip from refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however there are the corresponding border controls .
special prints with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
but the seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany with regular gul@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ tu@@ inger once again called for more enhanced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria leads to insp@@ ections in Austria at its borders , is a logical consequence for P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger . &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the history of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the &quot; New Shi@@ pyard &quot; re@@ building in the Lin@@ zer Industrial bar is officially completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the IT Group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could imagine to invest in Star@@ tup companies in the New Shi@@ pyard , and later also could be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what the more low @-@ size money promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the League ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is run by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of balance in the building are already rented out for another 40 percent of it en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened a second shop in the Arctic
Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are on the new shop in the new shop .
actually Jutta was wanted to get a dog .
this project had to postp@@ one the 49 year old educ@@ ator of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ren@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade without further ado : finally it has grown to grow in the form of another business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , all around Dam@@ en@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it was re @-@ converted for several weeks .
&quot; but I have survived it for a long time if I want to open a shop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive for the decision was , among other things , also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a own location , where only her hand@@ bags were sold , done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the single in the large area of Linz , which gave this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has been given wide by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am looking forward to most when something developed , and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why so some woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce instrument can not answer the specialist with last safety .
maybe it &apos;s about it that a nice bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ ar tower from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ äl@@ zer of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose orph@@ ans are called by don@@ ors .
this property also involves a billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he is concerned , journalist , journalist , or inqu@@ isi@@ er of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential election triumph@@ ed vig@@ or@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cut well .
that will also be registered in the Ga@@ el@@ ic K@@ all@@ city where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ ard date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker , with the F@@ loo@@ d@@ watching , is a term thanks to the wine shop at the Wine Route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 1200 @-@ inhabitants live in the 1200 inhabitants is one of them , related to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ city in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del has cut a film about tr@@ ump .
and what the vill@@ agers will think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are exciting in this way , but are not so impressed by it &apos;s conc@@ eivable way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ all@@ ag@@ städ@@ ter has a sweet documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ ints , to which next as Tr@@ ump also counts the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trumpet , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ city &quot; ( 2014 ) also at the saying that he would certainly be successful , if he would live in K@@ all@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a little bit w@@ alled , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ city within the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - High German : the An@@ gi@@ ver , says them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trumpet is from the village of the legis@@ l@@ ature .
the Tr@@ ump &apos; success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and the US opened a restaurant for gold mines in the US .
cor@@ nerst@@ one of the real estate company was the first floor shopping in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of Tra@@ ction : your desire to return to their homeland in duration in the Bavarian state which belonged to the Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Co@@ el@@ ic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , was declared a film launch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is contrast to the mit@@ ochondri@@ al statements of the desc@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US , claiming the construction of a border town to qu@@ en@@ ish illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like the pol@@ arity , it is not as sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant transformation of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born n@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &apos; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner retired for the American , &quot; he is always so exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he believe that tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never takes care of K@@ all@@ city . &quot;
the Pension P@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm is mentioned as some K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit something for the church organ donation was generally favorable .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it is the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he does not make the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had been in the US at the time of his grandfather in the US , they would have been there , &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him &quot; says Win@@ nie &apos;s Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a president ?
&quot; it &apos;s not my president . &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ end@@ ula Film , for the Tr@@ ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 protest@@ ers , also in the US awak@@ ens the interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Wal@@ ore community Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vice President of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , received the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages in Austria . &quot;
in neighbouring country the dor@@ ny alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; has more than 2500 inhabitants .
at least one @-@ fifth of its area has to be reported as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings in spite of the attempts of Nine to adopt the loss of leadership with the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson fighting Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of leadership in liber@@ als . but there has been no big shifts in the ratings for today .
the breakfast show from Nine was broadcast by the German capital and Malcolm Turn@@ sti@@ s made the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival sunrise period with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days appeared in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV programmes that include Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play any role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise has an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months Today made the gap to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , today an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi@@ ther@@ to , Sun@@ rise has risen to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at an average of 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most interesting thing every morning .
the winds of change are more than the Parliament in this morning !
Karl and Lisa are fine . thanks for checking !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ al@@ ar by Le@@ to the Raf@@ el Erik Thom@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama over a recently expi@@ red father , who decided to settle down with his two children off the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics asked whether Thom@@ son had a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ cer star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X Fac@@ tor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and smote the Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8,000 ) and TB@@ L family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( from 17 : 00 to 17,@@ 30 ) of the new quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe left an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second half hour ( from 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour of 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decline in the f@@ oten from the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident , that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar issue not managed to survive the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
revealed mystery ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o are probably un@@ aware who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman at which Sam Wood has ended up in The Bachelor &apos;s family has been covered with greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and no of the three left @-@ left girl is certainly not going to give up whether she is the one that has received the last Rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we are checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on day before three are checked out , you may have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam Wood has sealed his lips until the finale on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women spread the ly@@ rical way beyond that , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If do not , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose ? , &quot; could find their answers to the gaming provider who won the heart of the brook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ o called both fast - besides itself - M@@ ack@@ ay is the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment on when I went into the house and Sam@@ s energies noted that they were pretty compatible , and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is now on the ground with both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen it together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she would be well suited to Sam Wood as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the attendance at last week makes her clear that Wood &quot; der A &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now just recru@@ iting him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked what Wood should choose if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it . &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equal - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the bach@@ elor will be broadcast on top ten on Wednesday 19 : 30 .

but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some train@@ ers were ban@@ ished for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost a ger@@ m as it was the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula kept his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return journey , and also in the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula remained his true face in the changing rooms after the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of grinding at the mill , instead of its R@@ ook@@ ies , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula confirmed Hay@@ ne also in his press conference after the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ pfer@@ ter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who told him to take his suc@@ cum@@ bed catch and take care of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched in a Pun@@ t who restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL debut had hoped .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field at the F@@ um@@ ble and later told later the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ t@@ 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that appears now , and only about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne was donated by the Schn@@ itzer with his Origin of his Origin back in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a cur@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence broke off on Tuesday evening at the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ nu P@@ ras@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , a leading district officer , said that there were more than 1,000 protest@@ ers outside of a police station , some of them attacked stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

20 police officers and five civilians were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not clear why the rubber tri@@ pod , known by those used to kill them , but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously produced a high death rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate was the last in weeks violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the marriage organized in Madrid should be made up as part of the proposed new constitution to reduce their policy influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were protests in Western Nepal between the lar@@ us group of the lar@@ us who want a state of their own .
a minimum of 40 people including 11 police officers have been observed in violent clas@@ hes since the 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this was originally on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , Ralf Ji@@ ffy went on to the offensive : &quot; we have not answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Members of the Council and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , this roughly ten @-@ 12 million euros have been under discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches pre @-@ dup@@ licate donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL .

Google has an un@@ common personal approach in the announcement of a donation call on his blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled from Kabul at her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip took many dark web and bus@@ ses , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear . &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugees and mig@@ rant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants . doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refuge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global donations will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / , at $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe has faced with his worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the fourth civil war in Syria , which has caused more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say whether easily surviving people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those , which receive Non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death data needs a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery which provided a review of the new study at J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss or O@@ bes@@ ity surgery using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BMI is a certain amount of weight in relation to size and is considered to be normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers utilized for the new study from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , which they have been in a study and compare two kinds of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach @-@ formation , which were easily overweight for type 2 diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average BMI between those who under@@ gone this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI remained with those who did not receive @-@ surgical treatments equal to 29 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , in 36 % the diabetes condition declined dramatically and at 28 % partially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved by one percent in comparison and partly by just around two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , results with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and &quot; poor &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally best found in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also supervised the patient @-@ glucose levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that reflect the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held by 7 percent in order to write the researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as shown in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level , does not dimin@@ ish the mortality rate in five years , thus the leader Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also contract average results in the two kinds of surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y Group ( 7.4 % vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit from the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study it was subjected to obes@@ e people who under@@ gone O@@ bes@@ ity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the conventional methods tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it should be re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once you &apos;ve accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , an revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten days visit in the United Kingdom in his speech to the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should , before the interests of the individual nations , or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mira@@ ble during the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for those Muslim countries can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence had never loos@@ ed these problems . &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence , and also commenting on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack from 11 September , revealed that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed a letter to President Bush in a letter , and I said to him , the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he prevailed and did unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the consumption of slopes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gi@@ ft@@ control centres in the United States report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , the strongly anti @-@ alcoholic disinf@@ ect@@ ant swallowed , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income for children under the age of 12 were based , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kids are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ant do deliberately drink while some they do to impress her friends , or due to a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants are only drinking for a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic cold water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive inc@@ iner@@ ators of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ al@@ ers .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry and grape harv@@ esting and orange du@@ p which are very attra@@ cting for children .
slopes of disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few inj@@ ections can even lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the University of Kansas , awarded the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you would leave no sip of whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children and when children go about it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl . recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of des@@ ic@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school was taken into the emergency department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold associated with an adult by an adult , said Dr. Chris K@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah per@@ ils her words and wasn &apos;t able to go as she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors watched her over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ n &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic beverages or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the range of the child .
about alcohol pois@@ oning were some disinf@@ ect@@ ant related to death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after the swal@@ lowing of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities appro@@ ve that the product was meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol that was noted as an active substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three pupils of the fourth class in New York City left to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher around the teaching area , &quot; said it a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their space .
the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; gos@@ sip &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three cars damage
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a dri@@ v@@ eway on the cross @-@ section between the Nord@@ ring and Her@@ bs , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old drivers had been slightly hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver ran on the cross @-@ section towards the district industry and took too late that two cars were stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the episode , he inj@@ ected with his trucks inside the rear of an audi@@ tory and sh@@ amed up this car to an earlier Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the un@@ affected vehicles , Sach@@ de@@ an was about 10 000 euros , the police spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths tou@@ red the sch@@ ematic of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , D@@ eil@@ a says that the Ho@@ ops come down to a poor place , but that he will turn again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

D@@ ons &apos;s lifting about Celtic on five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first half of the year , Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter gave a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so the D@@ ons succeeded in creating a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths ten@@ ds talk about dis @-@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , what was refused by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team @-@ team could not stand under elevated control to the Dutch tab@@ loid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not believe that we are under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football te@@ di@@ bo@@ res low countries - de Bo@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Rang@@ ers &apos; mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er , that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there &apos;s no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they won &apos;t show highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not just talk about the back of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will revol@@ ve around and swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RON@@ NY D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic up to fight , but Norwegian Chef s@@ ware to reverse things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following defeat in Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ crete from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now stands out with five point advantage clearly at the top of the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we just feel it - but we have to go further .
we really don &apos;t really need the support of Celtic , because the player gets better .
now to be merged is so important .
War@@ burg is cau@@ tious in January transfers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , the Rang@@ ers @-@ boss Mark War@@ burg is cau@@ tious when signing the latest news and insi@@ sted that he would not inter@@ fere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January Transfer window is very different from the Summer window . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players coming in summer , have this pre@@ season time to integrate what you saw in this season with our own group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crew is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more harm will do to add unnecessary players to the Add you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hear@@ ts sent 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field , and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red map of the Defence was lifted later - the third red map of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said , and answered , &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ ne@@ castle

the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ ne@@ castle in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certain to say that I returned not to Ty@@ ne@@ castle because it &apos;s not playing for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I think that Stephen Thom@@ pson has confidence in us .
we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; Don@@ nel@@ ly said .
Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to win against Hamilton &quot; un@@ fair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dreamed that his team was desper@@ ate to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ tivi@@ sts to win a seventh consecutive league victory , which brought them one advantage of five points prior to Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ y El@@ f@@ meter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; There are no team who won everything , in Po@@ or , or Li@@ sts who won &apos;t won games this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while working in the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without employment has risen to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent over the same period was 5.5 % , as the number of offices for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent , an average number of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell , commented on the latest figures , said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision , part of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced additional improvements on the Scottish market with an increase of employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drunk b@@ unk@@ y the process
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the security personnel couldn &apos;t speak of peace , the personnel invo@@ ke the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only with the use of pepper spray the cler@@ ks were able to arrest the stur@@ dier in custody .
a breath@@ ed result was a 16 year old 0.@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adoles@@ cent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 year old boy had 2.@@ 15 am@@ mi@@ le and remained in custody .
why I will be a worker in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a after the execution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see how a man is put to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will be sitting in an audience gallery in the Death kammer at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first recognized in January about his best friend and although I was shocked as I agreed .
when the day comes closer I started to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell all the story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are seeing in the US , and since often more applications are available as places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who will be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected will be non @-@ emotion@@ less observed .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to sit down to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of stem , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visiting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh much if we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pin to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of conscience how it wants , and you get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tap@@ ed it &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it is false what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wants an international repor@@ ter present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of movement will help against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware is a repor@@ ter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post office right next to me .
if you want to know more about the case please listen to the Pod@@ casts series that I did .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I can &apos;t tell you that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his actions , after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese , would owe him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that a strong probability , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe that its execution is false .
and I will see him from this point of view .
I can &apos;t claim to be an objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters trying to contact us for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you will get of me is what it means to die a man or her unnecessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having discovered the susp@@ ect , this one tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &quot; I come not away , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Physi@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have eaten a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that all is coming out once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with it what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want to think that my owners think I try to do my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start to think , I do not practice this , then I should not be more train@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to consider what I am doing with my license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , allowing the integral department to pick up his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before ei@@ ghte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart will go into my st@@ ables to send information about what I would do within my st@@ alls , &quot; Moo@@ dy said to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that &apos;s the case , they should surely deal with their n@@ oses , because they have been trying to deal with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , reig@@ ning president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , being aware of this time and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should this allow me to consider that it is personal ?
did the Route L behave and are perhaps responsible for people outside train@@ ers in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
do I get so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside I &apos;m doing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take me my license and leave me out , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ strations levels of the trainer have built over the long lasting cob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching gave up that he could &quot; throw his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by his preparation of his eliminated M@@ J Black C@@ avi@@ ar awarded the racing treatment option &quot; ridi@@ culous . &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the equ@@ est@@ ones .
&quot; it is against the rules of motor@@ sport .
I have to take full responsibility for it . &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my colleagues got rid of mud on the leg .
it could have been so tonight .
it could have been so the whole day like that .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man to driver Cur@@ sed is arrested
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent w@@ agers in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after which he was hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray Valley Highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police told the drivers continued , without stopping , stopping at all to help the injured driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia of the Police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ one presented himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is expected to be charged with ch@@ asion and decre@@ asing assistance and due to other traffic@@ king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 year old man from Cob@@ ram will remain in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy to battle against ri@@ vals on claims of E@@ Ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of the Tac@@ tics of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two prime league favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators will be allowed to compete in the storm of the Storm game with his team during the high Storm win leaderboard in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a secret note to the Storm @-@ Team after his team played the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called that the two from Queens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that at the Tac@@ tics they are only concentrated on their &quot; Contact . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team showed him confi@@ dently , since it means they were worried about to hit the Storm Team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s always up again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ tones when she played us 24 : 2 said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our defen@@ sive system or the techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made contact with Tac@@ cles a real focus , and this made us the trend revers@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this happens again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bored &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting was their game , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wayne announced that he will take care of a shit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team who can play it and watch it as exciting , especially its young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I built up stronger faith , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ ster increased a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or are breaks and no points are bot@@ her@@ ing ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
if they mention us it means that we will meet in a phase still on it .
the Storm @-@ team has free at this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 damages deposit to drug connection
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who could possibly adopt a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his trial , into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , has been smu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , was released about 200,000 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c ( 29 ) was one of the five men who were arrested over the last month after the Federal Police dropped 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay and submitted to the Co@@ om@@ era in August .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ accused in the calendar and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug into a Toyota echo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a possibly lifel@@ ong sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , it would be no evidence that he tried to possess the total amount and that in the Café could have been a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Judge on Supreme Court of Justice Peter Flan@@ agan was worried about the danger of death at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia . &quot; he explained the dish on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pro@@ vocation , he lied the police on his position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife and his st@@ ep@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security , in order to at@@ tain its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the further explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a $ 200,000 dollar will be a real financial burden , &quot; said Mr Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this alone won &apos;t be sufficient to stop him from leaving , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he reports his Australian and his Serbian Pass to register daily and at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
a truck driver was severely injured during a dri@@ v@@ eway with three trucks on the fre@@ eway 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
two of the three parties involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent location in the direction of Basel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn left to the left , as the police cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab is completely separate .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 @-@ between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed on six hours until 2 am .
it was created a damage amounting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone from girls to temp@@ t P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to transmit images
a p@@ um@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g assumed the girl &apos;s telephone when this was asleep , he logging in to an online mess@@ aging service of which he was sent to him by a number of un@@ decent pictures of children that sent him from another user .
the girl woke up later discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping har@@ og@@ g .
she saw it because the conf@@ using messages found immediately and immediately got their mother immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed the computer that were found under the address and discover &quot; web research that used terms of in@@ constant images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g said against the officials that he would do it , since it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet , &quot; and he then presented &quot; was a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghtened them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Church E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ t@@ son told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a diction , - that he &apos;s addi@@ cted to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave that the searches on the computer were done by him , but said it had happened to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghtened to educ@@ e@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and asked to send more photos to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that he did so to l@@ ure her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he appe@@ als , and said , he will see images of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the telephone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and with tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then looked up the un@@ decent images on the telephone and con@@ front the accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty to the release of the indictment , un@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 last year , and will not be appearing in court hearing on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g is not appearing in the Register of Sex@@ a@@ off@@ ender since one can argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element can be found in his failure .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael will announce the verdict until October to receive background reports about social work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was placed in custody on some other cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was still recorded before the date of the verdict in the directory of sexual crimes .
tow@@ ing soft on small fron@@ ts to Germany from
more and more refugees are taken up in the German @-@ Austrian border by the major control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many locks , for fear of discovery and arrest , are increased to smaller border transi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
S &amp; D spokesperson on the Austrian section said a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the border crossing Inn , Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn were picked up more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were walk over bridges and dust to the German side .
there they are taken from polic@@ eman in reception and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Munich Central station , the Federal Police Information gathered significantly more refugees in comparison to the beginning of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 700 people have arrived in the capital city alone until 8.@@ 00 pm , said a speaker in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : prec@@ urs@@ ors of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected
meteor@@ ologists war@@ es in front of falls in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) was released in Stuttgart because of an low @-@ pressure sur@@ ge over western Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful gar@@ ief is the fo@@ oth@@ ills of the tropical &quot; Henry &quot; , which was pulled over the Atlantic over the past days of the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe storm storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to D@@ WD , up to Thursday early in the Black Forest , at the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance , count between 60 and 90 kms per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the masses do : every two years the highways at the IAA show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all movement with the compact cars aimed at selling particularly well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 2@@ 8,1 % of new regi@@ strations accounted for by car @-@ federal law ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
a large number of new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concepts and luxury cars this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German highways is also the Opel Astra who will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the heart of the brand .
the new Astra is also not sold to be much cost@@ lier for this new Astra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel imag@@ ines a starting point under the largest competition in the VW Golf , with a view of 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 liter engine with a 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ es@@ sian catalog also offer additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp and will also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially available only as one @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second variation will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what is next to the Astra at the IAA still working on new comp@@ il@@ sets again next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ do@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its competing competing in the Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively a fifth to a conventional and a emphas@@ ised sporty GT @-@ Version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the beginning he will come back in early next year as a comb@@ i instrument .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ springs wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the design line of the brand with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo power and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer data of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno park in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ator laid the end in front of the gr@@ ille : here the radiator grill was re@@ marked and equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch@@ screen and is first integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition at the IAA in the compact class , a number of new versions and new variants of the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I was regarded as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of the cell are un@@ un@@ worthy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court was right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Court &apos;s Court of Justice , which was lodged for months in a small cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to injury of human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees generally entitled to financial compensation if they are lodged in too small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was decided by the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht ) in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those subject to the judges even could only hope for money if they were only few days in the narrow rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional reserve in Karlsruhe : it was housed in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally seper@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man , who once again was placed in the absence of his fore@@ station , was laid down in a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his official liability was failed due to un@@ worthy liability against the Berlin Land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the verdict of the Chamber of chamber in Berlin and returned there to re @-@ audit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if legal reasons were author@@ itative by the question@@ able period just a few days of prison for the compensation , the appeal was given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise it would be &quot; to worry of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the Chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of cash compensation .
the constitutional principles have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
thus they spoke to a prisoner in April when he was naked in a prisoner cell .
decent un@@ worthy is a decision taken from 2011 as well as the multi @-@ de@@ fle@@ ction of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court , a prisoner in a parallel case , confirmed a decent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former k@@ lä@@ ger ranged from 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also received the head@@ lines due to missing personnel in the last few weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cap@@ tives are therefore always enclosed during 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is to come , even to ra@@ pp@@ ings because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information by the Court Office 21 positions in Te@@ gel were not occupied because of the young age group ( 19 ) .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we accomplish this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers come to Germany from forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Education in Germany this year , according to Vice cer@@ er Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is capable of accepting a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated against the unusual challenge , &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany medi@@ ates the following overview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to various predi@@ ctions between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the federal ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments each year - and the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but above all for affordable rental objects : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing are from rental loyalty and particularly favorable apartments will apply for refugees too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister for the Bank of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is therefore to double up to € 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 Social dwellings are in@@ stituted a year , and therefore the Federal State would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister for Con@@ stitu@@ tions agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to esti@@ mations from the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 per cent of the refugees fle@@ dged in Germany can be employed in Germany over the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in Germany , the refugees won &apos;t be asked for their qualification systematically in order to help them start with the entry , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is decisive if they will find jobs in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour is the key for social contacts , for appreci@@ ating appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says Mig@@ li@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Thr@@ ash , in Germany , it gave a political change : from the prohibition of labour to recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the resi@@ dency , the asylum seek@@ ers at a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , too , the vision of the labour force - mainly the perspective has per@@ ished that refugees to become more rapid access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labor market are lack of German .
so far there is no suitable offer for general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are the most common by personal contacts .
therefore the setup of networks is therefore a view from Thr@@ ash@@ hardt from the royal road to employee integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School of School has found that only a few poultry parents give up their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ren@@ ched parents , Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ em@@ bar , spokes@@ man for Youth and Family at the Berlin Senate department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family nevertheless from the advantages of kit@@ a they distributed the management bal@@ lot in different languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the need for educ@@ ators be strong through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate is trying to raise the training capacities - approximately by paying more vocational schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the countries students without knowledge of German are being prepared in classes on the classroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are not always instructed by trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have qualification in German as second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no short@@ age on them ; says Be@@ ate St@@ ures from the Berlin School of Schul@@ te .
the German student of Student estimates that roughly 20 percent of the refugees are studying in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no federal asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the course - the only exception was the only exception of Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has given up its post@@ ure now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
study content refugees could be made easy access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a lo@@ oting , or dung , no services after the asylum seek@@ ers are more effective if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter are fundamentally &apos;t getting BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G because they are not allowed to fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ore@@ mentioned persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ged@@ ul@@ ted refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years , to be eligible for BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , reduced from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this gap must also be closed , by Steffen Kra@@ ch , the State Secretary of Science , and the German Student Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students should get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and so for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should step in Islam under the same rights as they have churches , and develop the existing state churches right into a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would also be important to the founding of an Islamic welfare association which is professionally based on new arrivals .
the duties also include obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representative of Islam must agree on clear agreements with some and willing to work together with the state in many areas and give him some control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the read@@ iness to tackle religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ ge such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will soon be a subject of whole society today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will change the majority of the majority , the dis@@ assembly of discrimination and racism ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a ban on discrimination and a general sense of equality for a long decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is learn to learn how the NSU M@@ ord@@ series showed in the police and authorities to ignore the rac@@ ist motif systematically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German demands a long time and what international agreement should remain peaceful , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens must use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
general in general Germany is able to medi@@ cally care of the anticipated refugees . President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery comments .
&quot; so far as Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ aci@@ ties we accomplish this &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however additional money were necessary to flow into the system .
to avoid eng@@ agements , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demand all the com@@ bs equal to the registry of health cards .
they could be calculated later by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to see so many people with the limited performance catalogue , see the asylum seek@@ ers Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the doctors are doing the language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi@@ ther@@ to so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved , migrants are constantly informed about their diseases as other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only in clinics and medical practices also would need to be taken over .
many refugees would also benefit from emergency ambul@@ ances in emergency ambul@@ ances as well .
and with another diagnostic look .
under Lampedusa there is a lot more un@@ treated disability and with the young people go about HIV @-@ lighten@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with partial other clinical pictures , German doctors come from their vocational training but clearly writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuberculosis are not as hard to detect . &quot; and what the fru@@ stration could be even alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees in sight .
the Syrians would have an advanced educational system . some refugees were even doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they would have their qualification , but would not have to break their qualification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is psych@@ ically ill : most suffering from a mail trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable to refugees who explains Dietrich Mun@@ z the President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study conducted by TU Munich that every fifth Syrian refugee mass is deci@@ de@@ dly associated in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is suffering on a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from others to the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with air@@ not , di@@ zz@@ iness , pac@@ ens , and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other symptoms are sleeping and sleep disorders , strong rating and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic symptoms , having early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but until now only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees have been receiving a psych@@ otherapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ologically ill @-@ asylum seek@@ ers can place an application for psych@@ otherapy , but usually processing takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the social activities , mostly non @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dreams
the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; takes us back onto the traditions of circus art .
the goal is to pull every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics and animal dres@@ sage and its unique entertainment .
now the Circus in the Man@@ ege invites you to begin with a brick on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my circus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto for the current management stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the circus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift to inspiration is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take people away from their everyday life and take it to another world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; man@@ e@@ an@@ cocktail with a world @-@ cos@@ mop@@ olitan architect , &quot; so the director Reinhard Pro@@ bst is his concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fla@@ ir can now be seen , 50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus is impressed with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international circus Festival in Monte Carlo . the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family moves the audience with humour and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the star@@ ring movies it wants to loose the Cuban duo .
ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous artwork of the mast is said to conquer women in the storm .
but the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus are also fascinated by finger@@ tips and joint pain .
balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sna@@ ke people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated by its ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family . &quot; Steph@@ ani@@ es Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse in the attitude of Circus are only too often subject with various animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes his position : &quot; if it isn &apos;t good for our animals , it does not work well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents are enjoyed every p@@ etting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are called loving , will be read from the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work together with animals and have fun with them .
does the animal does not feel comfortable it doesn &apos;t want to enter the Man@@ ege .
so the top commandment is : do good for the animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specially on their Zeb@@ roid sheet , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land@@ p@@ ony@@ h@@ ass@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ d , is the family Pro@@ bst proudly present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two animals lived together in an en@@ closures for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then - suddenly our small Jumbo Ti@@ da &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Zeb@@ roid is not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the circus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 : 20 am .
the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 16 o &apos;clock on Sunday .
Thursday &apos;s family @-@ day is for the performance reduced by 17 o &apos;clock .
T@@ wel@@ far@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in Parliament
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EP &apos;s opening was clou@@ ded by alle@@ g@@ ations of the opposition , that they had been out@@ spoken and warned by Mr Mu@@ gabe by Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month they had spread it off , and interrupted him during his speech in the State of the Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man for the democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions will send SMS messages on their mobile phones they warned against noti@@ fying Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ les speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists according to Mu@@ fork . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they fore@@ see the affected parliament members that the immunity in Parliament end , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity was no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 30,000 jobs within the company &apos;s re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings and savings in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer operations from its fast growing company hardware and service activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job loss leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support businesses during the transition to a new style of business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better prepared than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has received more than $ 50 billion and will be focused on the provision of un@@ ri@@ pping , integrated technology solutions for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard . the Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed through a massive restructuring in order to master the revers@@ al of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the belief that closely foc@@ uss@@ ed on improved performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Arsenal - captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta say that team @-@ amm@@ ate before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the ver@@ aged Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger has been stressed by Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and if his rehabilitation according to plan is , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure at least the next four games for England and in the light of its history , his involvement in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and returned to its old swing during the previous season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that is not cur@@ able .
this is not a major matter .
this was only an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in connection with its an@@ kles , or with the injuries which he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true from a medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated threat from other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also develops a unpleasant design .
the study of Prime In@@ j@@ de Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 of arsen@@ als of 157 league players in the last five playing times .
the wider picture of Arsenal is that in six out of eight play times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have had most of the injury .
where close the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have an acci@@ dental time to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday and W@@ enger is setting up a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta could start .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players a little delay , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal had clear favour@@ ites by group F and the Mak@@ si@@ mir Park in Zagreb is one of the playing fields with the biggest in@@ timi@@ date in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is und@@ ro@@ uted after 41 playing after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake that was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 on Tuesday evening .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has moved from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven away from far away with his management to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense . &quot; said W@@ enger .
arsen@@ al has never folded before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that grants us more serious lessons about male friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become desper@@ ate than ever before , as su@@ ici@@ dal @-@ cases prove by young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign against Living Mis@@ er@@ de ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a her@@ b@@ ular life ) 2015 is dealing with the goal to prevent the culture from asking for help if they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship is at heart in combat to resolve this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms demanded that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere &quot; , his chances of recovery have doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circuit of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course one must have friends with that a friendship may work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of more social media , communication , focusing on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital life has the need to re@@ prove strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if the isolation was actually domin@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , everything on expense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently explained money can &apos;t buy luck really .
the Schön@@ e with Friends was that this focus was on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler ma@@ stered hu@@ gs , moments of soccer players in cozy sessions and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out from knowing that men can always keep themselves back in completely their emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a employee of the telephone care I explained to me : ... &quot; my listening to people who are de@@ pressed and threatened , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the men that contact us , often do not feel in the position to speak with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mption &quot; I will cope with it &quot; has a huge impact , like feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you encounter any problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British is one of the shows that comes in mind when I try to provide a long @-@ term terrorism task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they clearly presents the little moments of male friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status via phone may also help people in the moment of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ decorated scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends to drink at Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even better if you sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh Sam@@ i after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to pass the PS@@ G on Malm@@ ö .
these are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh &apos;s Cav@@ ani continued course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain introduced its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria took less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ts as PS@@ G players , who took the French master on the way , but afterwards they launched a series of opportunities when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needed Paris a strong start to the Swedish champion , since it is not only a qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but improvement on the way to the square in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while they got the points earned it was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ k Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ k@@ movi@@ cs were a chance to play against his home town team and against the club with which he started his long career back in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . hence , it &apos;s a good start to create our opponents problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to finish in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won &apos;t win , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ k@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team at the end of the weekend , but he was cast out into the fourth minute through Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Argent@@ inian war@@ p was lab@@ elled as the man named PS@@ G on the next level in Europe when he walked over the last month from Manchester United to Johan Wil@@ and pass straight into the long edge of the grid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Malm@@ ö the Celtic in a Play @-@ off hit the level to reach this level with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far from Kevin Tra@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G itself gave herself up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ees and bad agreements , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ k@@ movi@@ c , who was abandoned in the first half of only five trials and then after Cav@@ ani had placed him after the re@@ start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his players into play and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ k@@ movi@@ c to the Di Maria in a shooting way which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the slopes ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate was finally reached shortly after the trip to Cav@@ ani . he achieved his sixth end of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this end all thoughts by Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent input of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance could stop the end result before substitute Ez@@ equi@@ al Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the train@@ ers in Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de announced that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we only played in Swedish League , which did not have the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Quali@@ fication plays are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola prevented the change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi have been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish masters , three times podium champion , four times UEFA Champions League , two times champion champion , two times European Champion , one time World Champion , the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi therefore suggested that he had already before the opening of Barcelona in 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid started all that we didn &apos;t say &quot; he told .
and that recorded the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not shift
but the bill did not come about .
and the decisive man works today for the German record master : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP has told me that I would not change , that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has won me . &quot;
who knows how in the 2008 / 2009 season started with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the four @-@ final of the Champions League against the entire distance on the lawn , opened the red line ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end of the King &apos;s Triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on playing variety in film
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the American film maker Eff@@ ie Brown on the diversity and said , I will not be needed behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a series of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , considered that the need of alternative perspectives empha@@ sized and in relation to a black protag@@ onists in the elected screen@@ play of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it at the instr@@ umentation of the film and not at the instr@@ umentation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown acted shocked , with mis@@ erable dis@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actors performed by The Mar@@ tian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production line Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers , to discuss about the show fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will also be the director , - as she will cover the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and it is a sp@@ ut@@ te , which is beaten by their white co@@ stum@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film . Dam@@ on answered that she could give us something that we do not want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion has been scre@@ ened , the social media explo@@ ded against the dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip , talking to Matt Dam@@ on about the only black person in the room , so he can tell her diversity - this is SO KNOW that it hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ et had earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time , at which exact representation of representation in the media is at the point of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement of Black lives nation@@ alized and pressed laws , discri@@ min@@ atory practices against Far@@ ming affect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince produced a reference to the movement during the introduction of the previous year &apos;s Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; album &quot; matt &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more recently , leader of the Black lives Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation in the response to the question of the Fox News personality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group &quot; said the leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Dam@@ on was announced that Dam@@ on was invited to discuss the pop@@ e on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he accepted the invitation or is already the Pope , it is un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; cryp@@ ted first champion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional Sport@@ s@@ climb@@ s and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ lete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never seen a competition participants who could shut down all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the season there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman and off B@@ ritten in the final .
to last place the rock was climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ritten ended the task within the period when he completed the first Ath@@ lete , which completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero made this challenge full three seconds faster what made him winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said to E ! News on the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , Isaac is said to his he@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent WE@@ ED was talking to The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why bass did , though he finished the cour@@ cour@@ s , did not receive any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists it will be the one with the quick@@ est time &quot; said WE@@ ED .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price , and life changes he receives the great gra@@ tification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think he rock@@ ed something about it .
he &apos;s just so fortunate to have done what he has done .
he has received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad you Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac had just felt the same if they had changed their roles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for a vertical season , shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers gr@@ ate to Minnesota T@@ wins
mint L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
in the past they were one of the best teams at Bas@@ eball and today the tiger &apos;s last place in the American League of Central .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiger was reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday this part would be perfect against Minnesota &apos;s T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins announced a chance for climb up within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters of F words , which was so hard to believe about a great part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun as it comes &quot; says Tig@@ ers Manager Brad ou@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support as Detroit three times in the first two interior , then once in sixth and then once again in ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) met 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and made it possible for three R@@ uns .
it was just his third successful start to his final nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year &quot; says Simon .
it is hard to throw at the bull@@ pen any game ; and so I really want to concentrate in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits from Seattle on 6th July .
&quot; he has made the drums good . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked well at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three ranks in the rear of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ d@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Right An@@ des Aaron H@@ icks fell on a colored , and Simon gave his second b@@ eman Brian Do@@ zer to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy survived Wall , the only man who was faced with whom he was faced , before the newly designed R@@ ook@@ ie Pul@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , which was designed by the ro@@ g@@ gle Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the conclusion @-@ run during the second , verses the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ sels to play Double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was this in the major League leading 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ghts a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Detroit added a Insurance Run in the end of the ninth inning , a R@@ BI @-@ double fight against the closer look of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right handed down S@@ ano is three Pit@@ ches for his fifth round .
Detroit looks to the start of the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hugh@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiger was achieved three R@@ uns in the first two forces against the left hand veter@@ an , who had been cancelled because of a back of suffering more than a month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted me , &quot; said Mr Hugh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I got rid and felt that I would get some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes gave a single second to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z a game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third leader Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right side , succeeded in a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to see what the threat ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiger &apos;s one in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ ding Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a big blow at the T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hugh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver &apos;s A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hugh@@ es came to three R@@ uns with six hits and one walk with four re@@ ke@@ outs .

hundreds of refugees are to be under@@ min@@ ent in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was waiting for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people in them should then be accommod@@ ated in shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remained about 450 to 750 upcoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ es@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily under@@ going .
they should then be further distributed to other communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alone in the past ten days , according to the survey conducted by G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in Hessen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have arranged shel@@ ters for the large number of refugees and shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : Germany &apos;s military action in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Munich @-@ based Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds a military action with German involvement in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I believe the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not be held without Germany &quot; he said .
he threw the European States &quot; collective directions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce has passed by a military participation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the conflict is struggling against our front door &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk .
former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive rise of international aid for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Minister of Home Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner on Tuesday evening said on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one sent to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Germany did not send an refugees to Austria .
&quot; no . this is so configur@@ able &quot; explained it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the question of an agreement in which Germany might record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it had already given numerous talks between the general director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete numbers did not name them and refer to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Bal@@ ans route from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and their Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann apply for a special summit with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states so far have not been able to agree on a common occurrence in the crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers will take a new start into the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the strong refugee within Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the country more strongly in the beginning and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was made by the Federal Government in conjunction with the countries , announced on Tuesday evening after four hour consultations with the Prime Minister , in the German Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Merkel under@@ line those people who need protection against them too .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view could remain in Germany as well .
this view is quite common in the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole should have an &quot; huge strength of power . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have now been stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia during the night of Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours on it announced the government in Budapest , the border to Romania with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat routes through Romania . Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
the Romanian government den@@ ounced the plan immediately .
there were first det@@ ours of people who had inter@@ sec@@ ted the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants are reported to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

even under the ice of Saturn the En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us s@@ app@@ t sw@@ app@@ t a global ocean .
this includes researchers from the &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i Raum@@ ein@@ i &quot; observ@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the moon is easily spreading on its path to ring the ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although this diving motion is only small but too great for a continuous sky , it is said to be found in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers presented their analyses at the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist in their analyses .
already longer was known that there must be plenty of liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
thus &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; had discovered ice r@@ ots on the southern end of Saturn in 2006 which spotted water vap@@ or and r@@ ots and thus feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the south pole there must be an underground sea ; astronom@@ ers were then closed .
however the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to its slim line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively many sugar@@ s - mainly sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. before all , Mang@@ os eat too much vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who e@@ ats the fruit is therefore supports sight of sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ go man@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the form@@ work colour alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
then they taste natural or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to them .
they reli@@ eves the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ co@@ ree and radi@@ cal@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney fits well into fish , poultry , lamb and wild .

first F@@ loo@@ se first : then distinctive Kalt@@ fron@@ tage
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night , the part of the Alp@@ enn@@ as part of hair dryer broke through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z went on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and night on Thursday , the hair dryer is partly with a whir@@ l@@ wind through the pe@@ eler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the mor@@ gue on Thursday morning , a significant cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently lying on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a strong southern western direction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this night side falls off the night to reach the hair dryer through the valleys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the Föhn blows up to Thursday morning with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and specially in the jungle with over 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hair dryer can penet@@ rate into the adjacent center area , and even in the mountains there are even hurri@@ can@@ es possible over 120 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday , there is hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture to the Alp@@ en@@ r@@ int begins to dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here rain set up a one that stops up to Thursday night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sum , south of the Alps has to be expected over the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , having fallen off big amounts in the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning , hair dryer comes off , in the row a cold front with powerful , partly ra@@ ining rain from west to east through Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along with the cold front , the wind picks up strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures rise clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days are present in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the South however it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of city president , Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday at the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for the evangel@@ ical church of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered the fact that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only lived about centuries as a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the square , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcomed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) found himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a couple of months in Rome .
he then felt the city as a deser@@ ved sin ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions will be promp@@ ted him to witness the histori@@ ans from histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the western Church with his th@@ on@@ ese in Ab@@ u@@ sh@@ al@@ ach .
hammer @-@ Dance launched three years in the interpretation of the Bible
Jesus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn cartridge is one of the main facilities , who painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ r@@ ust has written the introduction and Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with gorgeous images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful positions has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but what is by no means meaningful with &quot; funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary : the respective issues adapted , that can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many subjects of the book &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are cycles that relate to issues like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he fascinated several partners equally : this is true for the Luther publisher , with its the@@ ological alignment as well , as for the Kettler Verlag , with its focus on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and above all is the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost it is focused on the basis of painting with the respective Bible verses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible verses of Ot@@ mar Alt in the study , and thus into today , into current cont@@ ex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nestled in between the original Bible Study of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , they formulated all his personal thoughts about the situation here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry band has golden l@@ aces .
this 75 @-@ year @-@ old reflects twice a deep insight into his soul and emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing ever happened to the cane &apos;s cane : &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to quit the work , perhaps to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to assist the art in faster career again , &quot; The perception of visual worlds is st@@ amped today by claims , and it is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is going to be pushed .
artists have a different desire and bl@@ iss to show things .
images always have something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer flo@@ at into the pictures , let them rise , discover and sense what strength they have , &quot; The picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ r@@ er@@ ted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung have always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he has grown with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old I don &apos;t care to compreh@@ end the Bible completely , it will select the mystery of him that are important to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a collaboration on par . &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost , &quot; Here it is about the pictures , the text explained only . &quot; he was a pictures Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .

so hill tow@@ ed up looking new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will go down in October , the First Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach go on board in the childhood and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hope this year has ever happened yet &quot; she said .
it should be started without &quot; further memorial break &quot; to work with the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B increases its commitment to refugees by 2019 , in the Bundes@@ liga , in the weekend a clear sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football respon@@ ds to the immediate situation in Germany , and secu@@ res his aid in over@@ coming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I consider the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every single person to get a grip on this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee status in Germany inten@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and there met the State Minister of Wi@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the German Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic surely will play a central role &quot; announced he announced .
the football can help and wants to help .
the decisive turn@@ outs should be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football Federation has thus extended its refugee @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. James &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some federal agencies support this program .
already at this weekend the 36 pro ath@@ ver@@ a a clear sign when they will be carrying up on the left tri@@ cot will instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) - # Refuge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only help , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sporting team Rud@@ i Compl@@ et@@ ely of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and awarded the intention as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every one and nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use our jet @-@ laws , no , we have to use our brilli@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have had so incredibly suffered to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent landmark of the League . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Euro 2016 quali@@ fier against Hungary at this Friday , the national team for women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach marked the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have been initiated in their own locations and be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as magnificent , there are small and smallest clubs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is of tremendous importance . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the association will jointly publish 300 000 euros in the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive director loses an eye in an accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; managing Director of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost multiple reports by a fall in early July the left eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of accident on the staircase of his brother &apos;s house in the US , he fell to a water glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , God @-@ wo@@ oned , went out into the road - that he told us so last week , &quot; he cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his work .
&quot; in early October we meet at the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at meeting with and &quot; working out of labour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday Edition ) , and will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP and full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I got a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t often comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again if you like it . &quot;
McLaren @-@ repair pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen at skir@@ mish ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen , a corresponding photo and explained , he suffered the injury if he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he therefore arrived in the afternoon with a little as a reserve for the two pedi@@ gre@@ ats Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ enson Button . just like one week later he arrived at the Great Prize of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ Q without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar - Indian in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was a com@@ eback to a com@@ eback with Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group of games of the Europe League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National player is also missing the table leader of the soccer league in du@@ el with the FB Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 o / Sky ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t look back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ EU@@ s joins again in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ play against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ Q @-@ Coach gets open : &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change his stam@@ ens on the R@@ EU@@ s position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he is trained on an absolute top level &quot; Fi@@ anc@@ ée for the World Champions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ chel has left open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high probability it will also make up the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research statement of Mit@@ er R@@ EU@@ s , that the final decision for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League has to be understood . &quot; thus Marco is not that wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to inter@@ rupt the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead pione@@ ering role in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the will of the federal government , Germany is expected to be a leader in the vehicle &apos;s shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to see a strategy paper from the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which led to investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at the Edge of Autom@@ at Motor Show from a &quot; new Mobile Age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automated , net@@ worked driving will increase road safety and care for less stress , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will also discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 , most of whom will come together at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strategy ier of the traffic Ministry empha@@ sizes the importance of the mobile broad@@ band extension and a generous circle on digital audio radio .
the testing of new technology is currently being tested on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be brus@@ hed by the driver &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , the German government wants to check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Germany is increasing worldwide that the allow@@ able top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the federal government plans to insert a change in the Vi@@ enn@@ ese Convention that only sees man as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with automated driving , the car will increasingly take the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that cover the environment and process data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study published by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be possible technically by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all vehicles on public roads be expected to be expected only by 2020 . &quot;
value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and high @-@ automated driving functions at the plant in Germany appreci@@ ates the authors of the study by 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic accidents &quot; said the SPD @-@ transport of S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Germans are still scep@@ tical but scep@@ tical - much more than the French or the Americans .
only eight percent of the survey carried out by the FOR@@ SA Institute in the approval of the DE@@ K@@ RA study will result in only eight percent of the German believe that autonomous cars will mean by 32 percent in the next ten years . by now 31 percent do not believe it at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents set up by 2025 on autonomous cars , 33 percent in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a collection of the B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to dissi@@ p@@ ate control during the entire trip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fre@@ eway , however , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the figure 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well every fourth , he would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll says team@@ work and double start at table tennis @-@ EM

the final decision should be made latest 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , also without Timo for the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ eps Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor in China .

&quot; we should orient@@ ate it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has taken a serious injury on the right leg .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant group
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a mix of whole huge fashion show and a wax figures , the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the highlights : window mannequ@@ ins that look wild@@ ly with video projection .
you have the spectacular creations of the French designer who became Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion world - and thus that he was put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was easy in the past . meanwhile it is real &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) which is seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation it is a good reason that the Mo@@ des@@ pot@@ ter has changed his beginning to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact he had been against it , for it sounded a bit of death for me , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one gets to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made public in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give a gli@@ mpse of this man &apos;s work which has been written in fashion history without ever having to completed a training course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not rebuilt , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed entire process , for which much effort was used to indul@@ ge , for example a styl@@ ist was held . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 tons of material have car@@ ded the makers according to the cur@@ ators of Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before the October launch was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a der@@ h@@ osen @-@ outfit with a cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers are also to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first and z@@ ag@@ oni@@ ous secret attempts by the designer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his ted@@ dy balls and dresses , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the fashion industry himself .
he stole clothing magazines and looked at other designer &apos;s dra@@ fts at such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought it .
he has not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing but could save the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ er head as a fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to work on long bas@@ ew@@ rit@@ ers in and around P@@ lau@@ en , therefore , meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dev@@ oured products and tips were produced in large numbers for clients who made them further work on ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today alone it is no longer working anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the bo@@ asting notes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead fashion is again important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early times of the pop@@ es , fashion played a major role , was then absorbed by the home textile industry and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt is calling some examples : spi@@ ke in jewelry and in accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
this is the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans on previous bul@@ lets and an increasing client .
who is not a niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer available on the market .
they are about half of all orders .
Mo@@ zz@@ ania P@@ lau@@ en is joined together with nine other companies Member of the P@@ lau@@ rel tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may carry the protected label .
approximately 80 per cent of its sales have been broken away in the last 15 years .
private deals and also wholesale is almost no longer available .
our products barely achieve our customers in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , mass ware is made much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively for chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also weaker exports - currently made to Russia and to the United States .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association seeks to score points through environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery area in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt is supple@@ mented : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
design@@ ate U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger outdoor School of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery &amp; spi@@ kes .
to counter@@ pose the competition from the Asian region to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension field between the most fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; said Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an existing design often varies slightly in order to keep a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago he re @-@ fashi@@ oned textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter to the historic mark of snow .
the machine ad@@ mits little cu@@ res at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ men of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se had inspired it : &quot; before , I could not start with a traditional se@@ lau@@ rel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the bla@@ sting point for their jewelry .
they shaped the pattern in silver in an elaborate process .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of P@@ lau@@ rel - young and old . &quot; says Re@@ uter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors were living in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and want to mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the top of the toe kick .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment was however not getting a re @-@ fil@@ th , but about a kind of continuation , which played 20 years after the first movie with the magical day n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

XI ur@@ ges that the economy is wider to open the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open broad ways to boost growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ nah said on Tuesday a group based on the reform &apos;s steering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double the mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission plans to double the limit values for mercury into large pre@@ dat@@ ors and consumers , thus doing a significantly higher dose of gifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who prepared a corresponding document of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects posed by vac@@ ant and small children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt , the limit values of the nerve for large fish at the end of the food chain should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strong with mercury that are not allowed to be sold at least 50 per cent of the total limit values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dou@@ bling the limit values there would be only 14.@@ 5 percent in@@ convenient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return for this mobility , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values with other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch did this but as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ ins , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they are already holding the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the lowering of cl@@ einf@@ all is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de down@@ side man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res that helps the economy only , &quot; explained Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal alloy for humans that have been growing strongly over the food chain particularly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the federal government warns that &quot; already small quantities of the ne@@ on@@ ates are causing the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal ministry is declared on his website with regard to applicable standards , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; does not expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly transported by coal use in the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information by the German Environmental Department , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock rejected more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total produced in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; durable and firmly established , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; been cited from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past year mercury samples of mercury into fish already included the most common health risks in the EU haz@@ ard warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
