Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the encounter , however , it should also be around the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years .
Washington den@@ ounces the ongoing settlement building of Israel and throws the peace of the peace process to Netanyahu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deal of the US deal against the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech to the Republi@@ can Congress , partly as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with indication of the upcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call professor was to have shot for his friend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a little bit loud voice of the police that he shot his friend and that the officials would have had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was essential to emphas@@ ise that his &apos; sweet dog was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the house , the cler@@ ks took Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to und@@ o . I love Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississippi , already 300 miles on the grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , shot at the door to his office and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tit@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford told that Univers@@ ality Staff must have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call eventually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day there was another death : he increased the life , when the police captured it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb moti@@ fs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the experts at both ends of the State , like what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , he said , He was not a history of violence or a criminal story . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had described Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both institutions were built in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose training course comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lines to be proble@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he also seemed very excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent changes in employment policy of the university would be that the doctorate , which Lamb had been so hard for him , would not guarantee an automatic way to establish as Assistant professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb couldn &apos;t answer any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the escape from the campus , the police finally found Lam@@ bs Trail that he returned in Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before he could be arrested , Lamb shou@@ ted with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people knew that he knew there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb began in 2009 at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagog@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received his doctorate in the spring of Ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ term friends of Lam@@ bs referred to him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carla Hair@@ ston said that she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met with shared friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy , who tried to teach the guitar playing for a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he was the s@@ warm of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted away when he was there , he said Hair@@ ston , 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , said they were left for 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; says O &apos;@@ ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos; ste@@ en said he was never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail , three years ago , came up both at one summer in the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ful and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , said that he saw Lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night at night 5 September last time , when Lamb had quit his guitar and harmon@@ ic play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no sign for that something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stayed at the night and began jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American U@@ na@@ tives and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , an English teacher at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the University of Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light commem@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Mah@@ n@@ guard , while the University of B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io So@@ lis told from Cle@@ vel@@ and and Mississippi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans , contributed to this report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was corrected , in order to ob@@ struct the police now that he had shot the emergency call , and that he had killed the emergency call his wife , but there is no indication that the two had gotten married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
toys AN@@ Us plans to recru@@ it less workers for the Christmas time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the toys said that there will not be so many Christmas season workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will provide a chance to work more hours at the currently working team and seasonal workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and sales centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 there were still 4@@ 5.000 employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start this month with applications , and the number of employees from October to December is rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the holidays itself are even months away , the Christmas business is near@@ er moving , and companies preparing to equi@@ p time workers to equi@@ p businesses with employees who sell , send , and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael J. Fox : about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes obvious that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; back in time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to me that I am a sim@@ ulated sl@@ inging and a measuring length of it , to be with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in time &quot; a documentation about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , along with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is true for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ el the biggest journey movie that has ever been shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN head says : there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five years of conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and distress for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN head calls for again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and promote inclusive negotiations with finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs of the five member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , at the end of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people , and the regional powers will make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban asked the five of its members to show the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Con@@ surveys suggest Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand @-@ brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some people wait for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how several Re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t work ( yet ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls show Donald Tr@@ ump in double digit range , and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course it is too early in the election .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will likely win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts argue that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys had handed the leadership to the rising tide in 2011 , of which no one won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have been fighting in a general election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but outer groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth can now recognise their umps , and start to drop their dollars to fall him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some current fra@@ ctions we suggest that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
d@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans see the Real Estate Mog@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Iowa , a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac voting in Iowa has found that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tor GO@@ P would be happy with ump than candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if cad@@ ets were nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two of them say that they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when he was the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as cad@@ ets ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; disp@@ le@@ ased &quot; if J@@ eb was taken away by the establishment of the establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees har@@ ness temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely acc@@ using for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive Irish voters , the real estate Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for an President , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same figure applies in the first random state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ law , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his duties and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents that his temper@@ ament did not fit to the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they raise up their scholars , republi@@ can voters think for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if required , those who win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination will win four out of ten , say CNN / OR@@ C won four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time , when four from ten end of July their money was put to Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters were not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Per@@ ry won the nom@@ ination would win only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters can look at the campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidates , Tr@@ ump does almost everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the sp@@ lit@@ proof field may lead to Tr@@ ump &apos;s guidance , while the anti @-@ pump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a pol@@ l of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between cad@@ ets and most other republi@@ can candidates , cad@@ ets re@@ aping the majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb John Ka@@ ar and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ side race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would pick the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have made their opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters think that they have voted for their voices , that they may have forgiven their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 % said that they let the door be open , to switch to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say they have made their opinion , are twice as common for pumping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with a ump in the matter of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago immig@@ rant from Mexico was called &quot; rapi@@ er , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course for 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expres@@ sions of tr@@ ump , His@@ p@@ ano Americans can keep away from the Republi@@ can Party , and will damage the re@@ ali@@ ation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with pumping while matters of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so long as the immigration in the spotlight will continue to do Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration across the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , notably by their out@@ sider status . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post they want to rather have a political for@@ en@@ ite as someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by The Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Iowa shows that three of four Iowa re@@ public@@ ans have frustr@@ ated over the Republi@@ can in Congress with 54 per cent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
a square meter of an apartment house is 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros in the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; so in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers supply a square meter in most cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich is not really a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ places , one of the price acts as a Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream @-@ start thanks to Müller and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry
spin wool cap in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky winner from Thomas Müller made the way to FC Bayern dominated the way to a comp@@ action 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus . then it ran .
a sovereign kick off the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario id@@ e have created a dream start at FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel of Piraeus .
the squ@@ ad of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth position in series should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his 28 , in the Champions League of Bavaria League , Müller received ben@@ evol@@ ent assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who has meant as a f@@ lange to the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate that , &quot; Bavaria captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised the fans in front of the Kar@@ ak@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a focused and dedicated performance without g@@ lowing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pir@@ ate had won his most recent six destinations in the top class , including Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) arrived here .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were brave , in their open efforts , but often to come up to works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attacks were often initiated by playing the left hand on the left hand Douglas Costa del , which rarely passes the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Müller had no luck than his flan@@ k out of the right semi @-@ field in the left upper end of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best occasions in half one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os lin@@ ter , Ide@@ ye Brown reached the head@@ ball of the Polish head ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then by direct @-@ withdrawal from the keeper Roberto with the knees ( 3@@ 5th ) .
even though the Bavaria had moved their usual with dominant games . Pir@@ ate could place pi@@ pe@@ ti@@ che .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the lan@@ ks ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had hired a quarter with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mario id@@ e &apos;s help back to muscular problems back at the Ka@@ der who was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Her@@ o had given the green light after the final training , said S &amp; D Matthias Sam@@ mer by &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; those who want to do something else this is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him as he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an in the struggling Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and later made everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made another one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the game it was come to Kra@@ w@@ allen stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of part um@@ m@@ ated Bayern fans clearly prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Piraeus with words and gest@@ ures , took the security forces and went with sticks to the Munich followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bavaria fan was taken out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has increased risk of losing teeth
who smoke it does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this makes an Pots@@ dam@@ er Long @-@ Study near .
the good news : in fact the risk decreases .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ W ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to smokers , smokers was at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 23@@ 300 participants were observed .
the main causes for dental out@@ age are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val ; st@@ resses the DI@@ AG@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis .
the relationship between smoking and the loss of teeth is therefore reduced to common gum infections in smokers .
not be clari@@ fied in what extent does smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who had smoking during smoking , but could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years , until the companion is back to the level of non @-@ smokers , expl@@ orer Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to convince people of it , non @-@ smokers , stated study manager H@@ ein Boeing from DI@@ AG@@ E : &quot; smoking dramatically reduces the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is good for the lungs and vessels , and leads to our insights into good health and healthy age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 20 percent of the population in Germany , aged 65 to 74 years , has been affected by the DI@@ AG@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous examinations had already pointed out that smoking reduces the risk of early failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pinn@@ ed the findings .
ar@@ che@@ ologists reach Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains of the late antique markets
the right banks of the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne have been ar@@ cheological findings on the right banks of the Rhine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated buildings and remains of historic buildings , Museum director Marcus Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are on the search of so @-@ called land monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at all construction projects in the Cologne city of Cologne the museum is always related to the specialist in Archae@@ ological ground care .
in the third construction of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists now find five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; text documents had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church had stood , explained by Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church , a cemetery with around 350 graves were discovered that probably belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman of freight cap@@ tures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman died in the railway station in the G@@ eil@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ lin@@ ers railway station , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the track to the railway bridge at the end of the train station and came from a train that came from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the capture of the board , it was borne heavy injuries according to federal police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was treated locally @-@ treated and taken by a hospital in a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the reason of the ni@@ ghtly cruising through the young woman , no findings were found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident was probably noticed by witnesses or na@@ tives have heard acoustic per@@ cep@@ tions .
residents or Pass@@ anten from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , C@@ alley Castle , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Street ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU Commission strikes the TTIP a new trial against TTIP
the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the sharp@@ ening of the scope of TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a transparent system , the controversial private air @-@ care institutions should be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system which citizens can trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström today stated at the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de reported to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the US calls for free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
the world &apos;s largest free trade zone in the world is expected to grow by 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ral proceedings were addressing the EU @-@ States and the United States to choose independent judges for a new Investment Court .
they should come from the EU to the USA and third countries .
the second instance is also provided for the first time .
it would allow them to raise an appeal against ur@@ anium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the process parties involved each themselves to a refer@@ ee , a not@@ ch against their jud@@ gements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens were not trusted by the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term she wants to work towards a international investment court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied there for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ral tribunal provided primarily by major companies ( IS@@ DS ) is one of the major reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ches are indicted by opponents as a kind of parallel ram , which allows for the company to pursue compensation on tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or decre@@ asing consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in first opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like camps saw the EU Commission &apos;s proposals for insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was transmitted primarily that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ ete ( SPD ) marked the plans as a big progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the reform , the Commission considered essential points , the Federal Economic Affairs Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ ration is at the table .
the French government welcomed the plans by Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , the European Business Federation of Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned that the economy should be limited by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly small and medium @-@ sized businesses could become dis@@ advant@@ aged by this means .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) remained un@@ clear on Wednesday .
negotiations underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA .
a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer viable .
delicate folk of the Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy person has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by Stev@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells about different places , which he always portra@@ ys on the map , what about his min@@ u@@ tian and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where they were born and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens proves itself as a wonderfully creative Irish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear wis@@ ely , very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time to look great and opul@@ ent dri@@ fts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a rejected series : each of the 50 US states that should follow in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the near future &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; was published and failed to meet a positive figure .
reduces it to Stev@@ ens here .
live shows him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the new York @-@ based musician returns to the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is released in 2005 .
dedicated to ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board Charts and are missing in any annual list of performing music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all productive experiment@@ ation , Stev@@ ens was moving into &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ cast@@ ed , but worn by programmed sequences or beats , and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the smaller clubs the stage shows are showing the colourful spectacle from Neon @-@ brow@@ bands and large fluorescent stage performances .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band from Germany .

the theater is mainly show@@ casing the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although nearly 2000 visitors are banned in their chairs now , the apparent Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without giving a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad fortified album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hears the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and you can thus throw the &quot; plate basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens was humble , plays a few older songs and ten@@ ds finally under the edge applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ igh@@ ter
Mr. Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionna@@ ire was eag@@ erly awaited since its election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s new Labour leader will give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s team , and will first create David Cameron for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will lift up the first question of his six prescribed questions , whereby its performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary report for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes to his appointment as a member of the shadow prohibition and at its speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the center of several title pages in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; he would have stood in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they called on dis@@ agreements with the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six@@ ths of the Parliamentary Party has supported him as a leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says , that political differences may also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the bo@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that the Labour Party made changes to remove the whole idea of del@@ im@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and pensions , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth leader of Labour MEP David Cameron since he has T@@ ory @-@ chief in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the European Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he asked &quot; crow@@ ding @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the removal of the Prime Minister is con@@ stri@@ cted , and that he &apos;s made to fight both serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented by the Shadow of Economic Cooperation in him , if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Commons to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was involved in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre , &quot; but some years later he noticed that he has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as she was sent to TV in 1990 , the fre@@ igh@@ ter was viewed as the most important bar@@ ometer of disc@@ ern@@ ing leadership and his position among his par@@ liament@@ arians , although critics have been argu@@ ed to be a caric@@ ature and deliber@@ ate reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Po@@ unds increased by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Po@@ und got up @-@ like @-@ like data to show a rise in the UK &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was driven by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this percentage had been the fastest , ever since 2009 in the world of interest margin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound was climbed by more than 1 % over the dollar on $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 2@@ 9.@@ 21 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap over 20 % , after take over @-@ over of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ ì@@ jo@@ ie , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after encouraging messages from the competition for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were up to 0.9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest sales figures show all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reg@@ ained growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE shares rose 5 % , after the mining industry said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ by a stock selling as part of its strategy to debt relief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share of packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sachs had its assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the sports dressing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of € 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are dangerous .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but unlikely , however , it is unlikely that this buying power will compens@@ ate for higher working costs in his company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans by J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both of them are - both in the potato driver who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ary owner of Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; potato rather &quot; on a poster depicting the P@@ EG@@ IDA movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ IDA demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , &quot; which he had seen at least in TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the barbecue has a barbecue king of meat and potatoes in his shop .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ulti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of Lebanon have meanwhile taken hold in the office of the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility models according to the authority .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer includes , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better . &quot; he finds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with its customers , the culinary agreement will come well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash starts in @-@ operation campaign for comb@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - Ein@@ ar
met@@ cash attempts to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash started a fixed @-@ party campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Al@@ di is opening two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets build their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ instream media and marketing over events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who sells samples and shop owner , who sell out tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will be through its annual investors &apos; strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A loads and generate higher profits as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in Western countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stanley , believe that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets won about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing actors but mostly independent single @-@ handed sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley is estimated that IG@@ A re@@ ta@@ iler could lose $ 360 million in turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this progn@@ osis is based upon acceptance that Al@@ di opens up 25 branches in SA and 30 in SWA and achieved a turnover of $ 500 million and 600 million in each market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss in the food and market and at the amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high Fi@@ x@@ cost estimate , Met@@ cash could cost $ 13 million before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A @-@ buyers are the most faithful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Stanley particip@@ ates in the Food and Food Market in 2016 , by 4.8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was working at a commercial in Melbourne that Met@@ cash most likely will disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of met@@ cash by Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2012 , IG@@ B &apos;s market share has dropped by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trade , which has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the debt reduction in the equivalent of sales and mar@@ gins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the wholes@@ aler being stopped and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to enhance sales prices of selling fresh foods every week and IG@@ A individuals in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and loading restoration programs at Elan will be guaranteed and hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deserves to be praised as cri@@ tique for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
coconut kin@@ is ( the younger of the talented Du@@ os who is always known as &quot; special KS &quot; ) got into the spotlight through the not@@ orious struggle of Cy@@ gios with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in Cincinnati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated twice by the ump@@ ire , which Harrison out : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have been causing trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after having sm@@ iled a potential US Open @-@ Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teen@@ age is currently in Glasgow - in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I en@@ vy some en@@ vy , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little hes@@ it@@ ated in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken in the US Open but I know Th@@ an@@ asi &apos; good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he has found himself extremely well in the US Open and even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances , with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserve much recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe that he was treated a little too strict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he is working very hard and he has never been a problem with the other players he is trained hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserve it to be judged for his own mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , Cy@@ gios is not considered to be taken into consideration that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long @-@ term fixture to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe that Nick has pointed out very quickly to what people like Feder@@ er and Murray have pointed out , and we are trying to think that it &apos;s going to think that it &apos;s best for him , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains the state of emergency shel@@ ters the border which holds refugees away
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary explains the emergency level and en@@ forced the south@@ ward border with Serbia on Tuesday , which attempted to come illegal in the country . all with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos followed in the border , when hundreds of migrants were recru@@ iting together in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and the Serbian officials responded by ou@@ trage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people escaped from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a landing on the street between the two control points of the countries and built there tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ strations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ists over them , the migrants &quot; strengthened the border ! &quot; and cried to ins@@ ults against the hung@@ arian polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some referred to from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbian Foreign Minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days meetings with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Hungarian @-@ Serb border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were forced to come in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary had not put his hopes for an im@@ bal campaign of Brussels or from its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency call on Tuesday gave more powers to combat the crisis in two southern regions , allowing the streets to lock and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also has to cover the construction of a bar@@ bed wire to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after having finished a fence at the Serbian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata noted that even prison expenses are to be used in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that the majority of the coming business refugees are in search of a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who have a belief in contra@@ diction to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws which came into force at midnight , crossing the border or the dam@@ aging of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , put the government along the southern border to Serbia , into a crime . these laws also raise higher man@@ tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the situation taken by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said Mr Z@@ ol@@ tan Re@@ ov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs on days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes or Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people at trying to cross the border and penet@@ rated the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in custody , and are accused of off@@ ending off@@ ences in accordance with the new law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities are to fix the fence fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian official announced two of the seven border @-@ crossing with Serbia , after a train @-@ wire with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing at Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of men and squee@@ ze a crowd of lives there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 20 managed to occur but thousands were left outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse to travel food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s advantage ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of U.S. Secretary of Hillary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race to nom@@ ination national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over to the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders rises in second place , at 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet , receives support from 15 percent of the elections of democratic voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months prior to the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion will say what candidates it will support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters are more resistant in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ BS generated a few winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton holds a great advantage over women and bl@@ am@@ aged , but these jumps have dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support for the men is significantly dropped , and S@@ anders is just down here with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons in democratic voters under the age of 50 have p@@ ens out ; and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the Democratic voters of the country , they say that they would assist with Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would certainly support it with some prec@@ inct and support more 15 percent , because they are the can@@ did@@ ac@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are thr@@ illed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinions are more mixed with those who currently cannot support Clinton , only about one quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their leader in Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Clin@@ tons supports his supporters in an open question , why they want that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that it is time that a woman &apos;s president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons supports their compound with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with problems and the elec@@ tor@@ ability is cited as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Vice President raises the potential for the presidential guard in the balances , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see it in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the democratic voters are asked of the election , those who choose their second choice is be@@ ating at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Clin@@ tons end@@ age , say more than half that Bi@@ den would be different before S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decides to can@@ di@@ de , not for nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hillary Clinton increases his lead ahead of S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in race for 30 points without him in race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton &apos;s best chance to win the election , but this number has fallen by 78 percent in the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that considers it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , at the question of what is more important at one candidate , Democratic Vot@@ ers call questions about the voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate , or potentially candidate for these voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates perform good results with some important characteristics in the voters of the Party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are considered honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den accepts the lead with the three candidates in honour of hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent did not believe it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ z@@ ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all these measurements a quarter of the democratic voters have no view of S@@ anders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s questions to Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic Vot@@ ers are pleased with their declaration of affairs and say that it has not influenced its opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans are un@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came across the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her had wor@@ sen@@ ed her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mostly public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who have said their views from Clinton become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
62 percent of the vote they do not hold for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 percent of eligible def@@ ici@@ encies can see more hon@@ ours than not honest and not trusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good marks in guidance .
to the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best with hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority does not see S@@ anders earlier than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for the sample sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters during the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in a national survey
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times pra@@ ises behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , half of voters in the new survey falls in the new survey and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Republi@@ can voters still support drinking in large numbers . the support of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was carried out before Fox News Deb@@ ate in the last month , about 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey showed that Car@@ son , in demo@@ graphic groups , emerged good in the republi@@ can voters with university education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Ka@@ herself , is hit by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Florida Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 by the Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus , or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which has been released last week demonstrates that Car@@ son increases in the surveys - with 19 % support for re@@ public@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post even showed cad@@ ets significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side experiences for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ ze for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need energy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in the last Saturday , during an campaign performance in Iowa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant towels : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea should be rather pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some are no longer going into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea passed this week to the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coast temperatures still offers the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are 25 degrees in the Adriatic , 23 degrees in France . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings strain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student died during a multi@@ channel ritual in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an complain about five persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked and delayed its transport into hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound backpack full of sand , and he repeatedly tried to listen to a frozen field on a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches and then he fell into un@@ conscious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was f@@ ainted , and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms of goo@@ gle , Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to help advice , said pol@@ ishing chief Chris Wagner on a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide from fossi@@ ls , princip@@ ally by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said pol@@ ishing ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be resur@@ rec@@ ted , and he died in his injuries next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a breakdown report , Den@@ g has been repeated with bl@@ unt power inj@@ uri@@ ous injury to the head , torso and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and members must be held to account , and this step is very important by authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charge for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with ar@@ mis@@ sive attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the individuals involved but if there is an organisation - it &apos;s official or un@@ official - it will also be respected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College proposes the br@@ otherhood and the national Brotherhood made their affili@@ ation to the local population .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rate of interest is rising , and the houses will be refu@@ eled and returns to bonds , and the economy will lead to a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , and how long it will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history for the economy provides a small guide to the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recession came in only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , even if not always , a factor is how the economy and financial structures react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives from the US Federal Reserve contributed so strongly that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates but rather on the period , which is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several variables play a role in fact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , market participants can conclude that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inv@@ ari@@ ably interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Ya@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to come to seis@@ mic shock , which might seem to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a based on historical trends , which could react to some areas of the economy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the market has seen in the last month , interest @-@ picking of interest rates can be volati@@ le for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment meets , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are apparently a tendency that return on income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , perhaps the Deutsche Bank analysts predi@@ ct a newer study , which has happened to rate interest in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to recent analysis about 500 per cent of the market during the past six days - on the way to the rate of interest rate ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) - the market leader within the past six last cycles by Bob D@@ oll , chief system strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , was published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur in the Incre@@ ased cycle and its margin begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recent rec@@ essions are a fact of business life , but interest rates they often promote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the present case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which failed to speed up and could speed up the recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be due to the lowest point at a rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , in 1950 , 118 interest rate increases only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only few expect this to continue , expecting for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed account only 1.5 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants have made a stake for the F@@ ed year round , and all eyes were fixed at the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strategy and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could only appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade show only an lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of 25 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increases cycles from 1950 to day in a super cycle with increasing GDP for GDP took place and on @-@ rec@@ itals , quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession was in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has waited for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession , and this is 35 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market opens up a rate of interest , and the pattern is fairly similar to that of the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than at shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at bonds the yield seem to be confused as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / reduction takes place in the cycle .
at the end of the raise cycle the di@@ ligence declined immediately and said the Deutsche Bank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strategy of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will result in exchange between long and shorter bonds , and lead to a block of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones writes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are evidence of evidence that the market has adjusted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the profitability is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rows have expanded and the volati@@ l@@ ity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has ti@@ ghtened their strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in big and whole , companies that wrap up the larger part of their operations in the US , profit from those interest rates will rise and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse , since a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares ten@@ ds to respond very positively to three months following an initial rate of interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed on average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consumer games outside the pure stock games will also benefit from increasing dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ er can see profits through higher yields , even when experts at different minds are as fast as it will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM . says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s T@@ ories , cri@@ tici@@ zing the transmitter because of its &quot; failure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it argu@@ ed that he is increasingly not able to distinguish from commercial rival ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , saying that they im@@ i@@ ded The Br@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts to Classic FM , providing a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do anything that does not do the private sender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham binding the BBC @-@ Bos@@ se that the public legal radio station is stupid , &quot; and increasingly no longer from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I do not use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; to turn - but it seems to turn to Classic FM . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also included the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously called examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC @-@ General Director pointed out the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I &apos;m learning by Radio 3 I &apos;ll learn about classical music nowhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music making really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to give the dedication of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I &apos;m really important for you , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Radio 3 controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ed that tough@@ er must be worked to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British had been less informed about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production which fell under fire on the EP &apos;s selection for the selection of culture , media and sport , having gone on the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory dep@@ t Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice of the BBC - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see , why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and isn &apos;t particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall , insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was being produced on a special BBC way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company had a hit in our own residential area , &quot; when the next time a variety of entertainment started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or give money to other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sale .
in the last month the lowest result since the record was recorded in 2000 .
online sales strengthened three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed the issues in November
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , experts say that there are now evidence that the online sales have stagn@@ ated after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ation , after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you regard growth rates for previous years and going back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sale of Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that sales online sales were more than three years , as a buyer began to make purchases on their phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America and is cited as the reason for laser @-@ sending revenues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Fi@@ bers get the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ der websites cas@@ hed out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that black Friday , in which the buyer could control the buyer for their bar@@ gain , buyers could make purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium , found that £ 5 of spending was issued a little over £ 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some products such as television and washing machines are now carried out more than one third of purchases on web @-@ shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of man buys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims leave the Mec@@ ca of the killed killed in Mec@@ ca - Bin Laden &apos;s family will be sanc@@ tioned in Mec@@ ca
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burial of Mec@@ ca in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured as the crane collapsed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered together when 29 of the victims were taken to bury the streets , who were killed , when a crane joined Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crowded filled , largely dressed in white , the circuit to sc@@ out their respect , as the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ certain cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funeral pro@@ cession passed by the Holy Sites , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then thrown onto the praying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company Bin Laden because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured , a section of san@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 sc@@ ans who were killed , were killed as a crane gir@@ ded by the large central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , was one of the four children who were on his first pilgrimage to the crane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents in front of the annual H@@ add@@ ch at the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Saudi Arabia announced that the H@@ add@@ ons will come to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group did not have stopped the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arabic version of the decree which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the english speaking service of the news agency , this detail did not agree that the company &apos;s guidance is forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man has rus@@ hed to reveal what the down@@ fall of the crane had collapsed , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ ch , which later takes place in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden group has not published any statements about the collapse of the cranes , and their officials were not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures , because it is not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mek@@ kas big mo@@ z@@ ee as a part of the massive construction project which is headed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an abor@@ tive son who was conf@@ is@@ cated in the 1990 @-@ s by the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before an arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrims , which is at least once in life of every healthy country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials said that 158 people are staying in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; administration officials , that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ ,000 ) were paid to those of the killed workers and the same amount is permanently last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injuries receive the amount of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap Eastern European ar@@ tis@@ ans is over .
Britain is increasingly concerned craftsmen and said Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe has an increase behind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to 200 additional screens , that aim to aim at craftsmen &apos;s tra@@ des@@ people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales places nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer in the City of The Daily Mail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that British perform their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of using qualified ost@@ atic ar@@ tis@@ ans who perform works in their home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful using a hammer or a brush to remove walls , it seems to be a minority today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because British are increasingly concerned craftsmen in order to perform jobs jobs in their homes as head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the tree @-@ liner chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has passed the services to deep prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops is planning to open tra@@ des@@ people and include 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said that she wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men prevail over the moment with their employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which have more than female single @-@ households to carry out more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we must shift this stronger towards balance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles through women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a big role in the decision of decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also has its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupying about 50 percent of the team involving women , including his management and financial officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her resulted in a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group negoti@@ ate the cost of closing the stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has 200 new branches of stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
functions of A@@ ich / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity prior to court
at the National Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / DO@@ B will have to answer due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ giving tax .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he has been acquitted on the custody of this accus@@ ation .
the current process has been postp@@ oned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused were cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the accused were eligible for use in their functions for private purposes until 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it costs the damage with about 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial agreements .
this fact marked the chair of the ch@@ op@@ ener &apos;s Senate Square in Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense represents that the club won &apos;t be a return at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports function@@ aries only have been charged and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had spent much time and money , roughly 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illings ( rd . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood in front of the situation : do we continue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we continue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the accused , invited by a financial partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fired money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having laid money out of security and security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless agreed with the club , you can manage the money freely , only no debts can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with corresponding financial - success , the payout of the repar@@ ations was decided on retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one took part of the repar@@ ations only years later , from the year 2003 when a plus in the account has been paid out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , package and non @-@ det@@ ann@@ als appeared , the former ob@@ man explained the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accounts and savings accounts managed by the two def@@ endants in cooperation with the second accused .
why the withdraw@@ als of the association were not detailed yet the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association does not have interested in details for the financial account , it is important to simply have the forgiveness of the debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was passed to the club &apos;s account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants were denied and the def@@ endants were declared .
this depreci@@ ation account was based on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not well known according to that statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the Lord knew no answer for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything from that money , the public prosecutor dropped into the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the co@@ stum@@ er compl@@ ained to be informed of the function@@ ary .
this transfer has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? we wanted to know judge and public prosecutor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this , the first def@@ endant pleaded not to agree with this formulation , since the club had never been a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal agent ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he prof@@ essed to the function@@ ary , he never related a cent content , he simply took miles of money and di@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on di@@ eting , he added to the association $ 1,000 per month and the actual expense was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were taken after an audit , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer has been kept , explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kilomet@@ er@@ money had also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all accommodation can be made in cash , in addition to lead to the bank to lead to the Bank to lead burg , he stated in his testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard produces more than 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to three years running breakdown , the computer should be extended with further jobs in the management of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the positions in the US @-@ Computer H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) are no end .
the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle the reduction of 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate clients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the company shall save $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion , shared the company on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special loading of around $ 2.7 billion , which will apply from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the removal of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian police used at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , Serbian border with several hundred applied refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind that a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ eman a water light was ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the officials initially put continuous pepper spray .
after that the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now claimed a little .
a pregnant woman and obviously the last woman was removed from the zone .
children who had arrived at the tear of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as cried out .
other Refuge@@ es joined together and had not suffered under breathing .
the press Officer of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US emer@@ gen@@ bench
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is seen when the US emergency bench has come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade associated with interest or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were asked of Reuters , found out that a little more than half , which would still have to do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will last a little longer and keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a historic event , because it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed Interest at NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , let us approach a situation in which a major central bank will be leaving the zero field and a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates begins , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , chief employees at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will add to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook for global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets have warned that to raise an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
Death guard at Delta State University left sorry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the fri@@ ghtened and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he first fri@@ ghtened his colleague , Sh@@ annon gave a note to tell it that he could happen to him , &quot; gave him wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social education at Delta State University , calling emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot one shot and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said the staff of the emergency call that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; I fri@@ ghtened my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house that &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller on his name , but he did not give him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb didn &apos;t obey any explanation for his kis@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when police viewed the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the writing of the note , mini@@ stered 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing him his own life on Monday evening when police captured it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knew nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb was supposed to believe that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , who said that she had been married about seven years than a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced from the age of 15 but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said , he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s have a daughter , which is 19 , and it was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s said her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s performed online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , had met for about three years with Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that I was calling for relatives to a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he was not in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the polic@@ eman approached him at the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in the night , mini@@ stered his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doctorate at the University of University in the Delta State University in spring 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars that have lost their lucky charm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ ress@@ ful years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partnerships , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convicted of drug addi@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the year , the Lufthansa Group is aim@@ ing to save a billion @-@ billion euros with better organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
150 of the worldwide 1000 executives will cost the work@@ around in the workplace .
there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the billi@@ on@@ aire Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of re@@ orientation is an annual contribution of about 500 million euros a year from cost and redemption syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline distributed on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things there is no board for the passenger business in the future .
the hot@@ line airline needs to be developed as a stand@@ alone as possible .
CEO Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr in the board of directors will be responsible for eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spo@@ hr also highlights the significance of eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company will in future want to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the organization of the 120 000 associates was complex .
the airlines operate under the Air@@ line Passage to the Air@@ line Group &apos;s three @-@ quarter annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tariff conflicts with the pilot certificate ( VC ) , the negotiations on the courts will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this divided the union with .
the topic of discussions will be the retirement needs for pilots .
cockpit wants to come as soon as possible with a predicted record result &quot; as soon as possible .
the conflict between the union and airline has led to several strikes over the past few months .
background is next to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilots the Spar@@ rows &quot; Wings . &quot;
it faces that Lufthansa in the fight against competing routes to the group &apos;s own cheap line of Eu@@ row@@ ings are out@@ sour@@ ced .

Luke Sha@@ w von Manchester United may not play for months because of double Fra@@ ktur
Luke Sha@@ w came in Manchester with the Champions League defeat of Manchester with the PS@@ V Eindhoven the body of his right bow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this brought the left outer def@@ ender of the wines and closing it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes at the field , and required oxygen before it was taken to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double @-@ color structure and is located in hospital . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later , then moved to Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awful - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard to play and then this happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the changing rooms he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have dup@@ lic@@ ori@@ ally , it takes about six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of a donkey @-@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ ins@@ ist the Mexican . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ rators had been mistaken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were mat@@ ured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a T@@ we@@ et in Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken me , my path to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w for defeat at the PS@@ V
the England defence counsel has an additional incentive in France to recover an additional incentive .
Phillip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves this type of injury to the place , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a nasty .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played in Mexico against Van Ga@@ As Holland working team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it wasn &apos;t possible to see the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who was sitting in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno told : &quot; I know how it feels . I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel so badly . I &apos;m so sorry about it .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was brought to hospital - after a f@@ ou@@ ling of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long , until you know it almost by heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are sure you are David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite child@@ care book has decided that the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax was elected in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all well and good , except that the following paragraph describes which Cameron soon describes the plot of the film , presenting new characters and details added to enlarge the fairly short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ id@@ st the w@@ alled town of Th@@ re@@ ville where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted O@@ uss @-@ accused the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , who died in 1991 and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if it were not yet susp@@ ect enough : the text of Cameron doesn &apos;t read more like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything was artificial and even the air is a commodity , hoping a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he agre@@ es to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems to be unlikely that Cameron stands as little as the local environment , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , stub@@ born creatures , &quot; which is called on the name of the trees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was del@@ e@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commenting on , the text was likely to have come by Cameron &apos;s electoral college . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron , but there were no immediate comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the dis@@ mis@@ sal from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reach Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but when one sees the ca@@ vern that England selected for the tour , there is a repe@@ tition of the 3 @-@ 0 test sequence not on my map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a break victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin player in the Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een is developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on test level , an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is related to this news : Adam Ly@@ th uses the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , as his head coach in York@@ shire , is difficult to analyze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult circumstances , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are oriented to results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark by Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he hopefully meet further runs for York@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss gave his attitude , even if he did not take so good performances , and not surprised me ; he is primarily a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time will receive a test b@@ ats@@ man to set his mark , is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - as Sam Rob@@ son , in front of him , while Nick comp@@ ton got nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just Comp@@ ton got the chance to play and play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise , when England first brought Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and is a ra@@ mmer I am high .
he is a x @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player what we saw at York@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square which met us very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must receive at least the same chances that received before him , but this is of course still dependent on the team competition in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of suggest@@ ing Mo@@ een alongside Cook , which would get an extra spin @-@ spin and get four tor@@ icks , showed up and I have nothing against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a bu@@ zz@@ ling cannot beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ een may not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my previous team colleague Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he entered in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he has made three hundred ro@@ ls immediately and did not look back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upstairs Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with it he impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people may see his statistics on - on average 31 with ar@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no big number of backup spins that lift up their hands and the coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England introduced a few smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ke , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences , as he has performed under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind into changing rooms , even though the messages are in harmony with the previously mentioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will not agree but co@@ aches and team formers do not determine the schedule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember , how the players depend on their jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ xit &quot; Bre@@ xit &quot; ( Bre@@ xit = Exclu@@ sive Great Britain from the EU ) could win at Zul@@ u , if the economy turn into a dol@@ drums by 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ founded new trial strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &quot; for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C which was breaking up for Europe on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ats said that some member states have been deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises such as the EU is now created and not always from its own debt that they mostly do not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided to do it at its annual meeting , that it may not like those to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win ally for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants to look outside Great Britain in the interior of the EU Zel@@ tes , says Berlin - and let us go through more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials from some major cities to the point it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel vig@@ or@@ ously le@@ ver@@ ed her power , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her as it has been done so far as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
French President François Hollande looks at his re@@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a letting out force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government - Spain a left one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to imagine that she should be driven by one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better off from the UK , something that she did not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so maybe some of these ministers might plan no helpful notes , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ k@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how to keep on the Fle@@ et Street at their costs and which EU scep@@ tics did not participate in the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has a name than a &quot; EU &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during all his rever@@ ence , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ caring ch@@ ur@@ ks , phone @-@ speaking countries and p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ countries that possess most of our major newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Tony Bla@@ ir joined her , but he realized that when one sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas around him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir ; as Bla@@ ir had refused to act as a judicial system for the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , thus opened an back@@ door opening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press never leaves him out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cla@@ p on Monday &apos;s Monday - I said to him that he had no time to repeat for me - in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott , a bug back then and today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may take a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to gain the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I always press it out - in development .
he says that we ought to remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ de tendency and the wild tissue of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Eng@@ lan@@ ism can probably say Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no guide to Ben@@ n , but not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n was a appointing John Mc@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor , a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father talked about to be loyal , loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without losing too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight for &quot; under any circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expressed itself - wasn &apos;t what McDon@@ nell told , even what J@@ C told his fellow soldier on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n will con@@ vey - remember that he even has touched me - news discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ g@@ gle of Social Media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , allowing him to show laboratories in the refer@@ end@@ re@@ campaign for a matter of self @-@ hen@@ sibility , such as McDon@@ nell told him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks certainly so .
but McDon@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equi@@ vocation for EU membership - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite Properties - is no longer a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dis@@ sident ; for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central set of dog@@ matic strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with its own deu@@ ces to Nato , Tom Watson is firmly convinced that J@@ C won &apos;t be a campaign for leaving foreign diplom@@ ats to try , in all , a sense of finding their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin exchange political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters , to make conc@@ essions to the British , if it all may be po@@ int@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government , which was reminded on Monday by the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England over E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alle@@ g@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes is less harmful when smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said scientists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by cri@@ tici@@ ze the reference number of e @-@ cigarettes in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive testing of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some researchers have taken the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month awarded the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y foundation , &quot; which justified his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other researcher write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the argument is expected that &quot; the present estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is approximately 95 % less harmful as smoking , on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement is composed of a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) . the results of the meeting were combined in a research report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the Treff@@ eisen &apos;s company was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose management had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report they said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated , to receive funding from an E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but do not supply the funding they reported to report@@ edly from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , add them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for the selection of members of the committee are not delivered , but includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also includes a gap in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session was also part of the P@@ he tobacco company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the Group is indic@@ ative that &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard drives for the damage of most products by most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the e @-@ report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J has already been re@@ acted before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smokers are dying in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes should be low , but we continue to have long @-@ term impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is , and what does not , especially when there is so much public confusion regarding relative dangers to the tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 80,000 people die annually at a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking - the national health system costs two billion £ a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clear instructions of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders and says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said : &quot; the BBC should stop programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that commercial rival had to turn their right arms &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not transmitted by other UK @-@ channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal agen@@ das , which will probably be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be on behalf , or send them clearly from un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fees , what I &apos;m medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least order his production at least on programs that do not make or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve a wide variety of support for their future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that no one would show this , is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is natural sense of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive wheel programs would finance that could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program . East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly known both original productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I strive to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC &apos;s help at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular newspapers give the back , what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , staged in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal NGO programs can go to BB@@ C4 as they can &apos;t measure up their tasks , and they may be argu@@ ing if they have generated all these programs to justi@@ fy the benefits , which no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lay it in a time@@ frame where no one ever wanted to see .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I encourage you to find a rather aggressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course you think all that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who for £ 150 a lot of money I wonder whether that &apos;s right , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday said that the BBC had told her appeal to mission , to educ@@ ate , to educ@@ ate and chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of the BBC production was officially classified as education ; he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and it should take care of the public @-@ legal TV stations in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown to make alli@@ ances available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ oc@@ a &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which it is ir@@ radi@@ ated with the impul@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have been able to generate worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ brakes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction of the moment in which they have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impul@@ ses work by switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry out the membrane channels that are react to ultrasound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said that worms revealed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ os@@ us , which can be used on ultrasound , in order to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could substitute the depths of brain injury to the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , mer@@ cil@@ worms do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani showed that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves , which then infil@@ tr@@ ate the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ampli@@ fiers are used on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves can cause the opening of these icons , and activate the cells which they are assigned , such a report of Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ ds , the worms @-@ controlled worms that have changed their Mot@@ as@@ ani TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when ultrasound is applied to the changing creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied by the micro@@ graph@@ s and transferred to the worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ a , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows researchers to activate neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ os@@ o could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light that needs to be sent to a visual fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can be hin@@ dered and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with Gene Therap@@ y and a therapeutic virus it is possible to ac@@ ulate the alleged human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin production cells .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become critical and trying to bring political work to the public outside of galleries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists relate to the work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another of the anti @-@ arms trade plac@@ ards greet the P@@ end@@ ler in the U @-@ Bahn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ nesty Video has been viewed on Facebook for more than 100,000 times and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , the non@@ profit organisation and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ over @-@ artist , who also works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed about the silence that was led around the weapons for the weapons and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic company advertising , but &quot; through painting with bright paints and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have made a fantastic job by sharp@@ ening our consciousness on the sale of illegal acts of torture on the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es by Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British Government and the guarantee that Fol@@ ders aren &apos;t traded il@@ legally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair dates back to the area within Excel , where exhibitors are fantas@@ tically and mira@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order from the US army on &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS &quot; shoulder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a &quot; unique shaped skir@@ mish , the outstanding sur@@ effective impact of the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever this causes it will not be pleasant .
eight golden rules for life in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , I considered a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year old student , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rela@@ ati@@ m , but only now I remember the strained sm@@ iles of those who have become upset - and to the numerous , long @-@ cla@@ p complaints over others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of what I have learned is to be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into the student dormit@@ ories are easy to fri@@ ghtening up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to gos@@ sip : people tell you where to get to Cor@@ by@@ n if you &apos;re in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re lying in respect to Cor@@ by@@ n , that it is just an army extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe in through .
and help others to do the same - make qu@@ eries and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out people you like in opposition to those you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were gr@@ ated and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ isher would . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and communal hits , but they are also places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ her@@ eby : do not think about taking the university with a relation
intro@@ ver@@ ted results get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ area @-@ area @-@ culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship go on , but you have to go away to get the energy I have consumed with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted , and send him a SMS instead of kno@@ cking to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through j@@ aw@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you begin the Uni in the climax of the back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck starts to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I smile at you when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself , and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are an independent bak@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; po@@ orly missing cl@@ umps made of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep sle@@ epy when you kno@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
steal food is a transi@@ ent crime in student residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check with the milk owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they boil in the inner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone comes to ste@@ als , you are annoying , and you have compassion on it , but try to add balanced as my fellow competi@@ tor who added her milk to pun@@ ish the thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is imprisoned now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should make no noise , which stops away from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that you belong to the human being in the perceived sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors to make them something more quiet , drum and bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they acted on it with still loud music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she finally heard about 5 PM , she sent her neighbors to sleep two hours before she closed their own music to lock her door and ended on her three hour test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would be randomly assigned to the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be om@@ in@@ ally embarrass@@ ing if you &apos;re going to take a fellow for your future wife and will see it every day , and perhaps sometimes see how they emig@@ rated to their friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow worker is definitely not your future wife partner , try at least to tell your under@@ wear a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment that you are notic@@ ing that someone has its keys in his un@@ locked room , is the boundary between Ul@@ k and Work@@ place fin@@ er than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good stri@@ de is fun , but it takes only moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drop a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fail any bad room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and place its keys in a glass of water which you then place in the freezer , but do not get rid of its owner on the ceiling for more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single th@@ read@@ ed , pet@@ ty conden@@ sers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building a farm building for people who didn &apos;t have much money for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees don &apos;t require living room , but as well as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to show how to design today still cheap and well @-@ build , &quot; says the 44 year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the apartment market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes how rapidly constructed the living room can be created , builds on a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees shall push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums do not have any sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in the face of the refugee flow we need sufficient living space in the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a tyre house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when people block the people into blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consisting of three apartments for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these houses can easily be converted to each needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the building lasted six months .
this is reasonable .
do the construction rules be complicated by their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I &apos;ve legally pulled my project properly .
it always makes the imp@@ acting Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ worth special construction and the pitch action .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will still be places who manages in a maturity of three apartments , needs at least three locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in the cities there is no space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their maturity @-@ project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me , luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate your competitors around affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true , but we have built a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but have been built to a design studio which hardly can afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees but also the only attraction of the mother or the barley company .
I show how to design today still low and well .
therefore it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting the application app , click &quot; General &quot; and select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is ready , you can download the phone calls to download and install it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered problems following the installation , as they get an error message that the &quot; software update was missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght comes or try to update through iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this might be able to get out of apps that might be more likely to get space - but Apple has made it easier to do this , as if you insert a special tool using apps , and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worth to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update , or is in the proximity of a load device , so the battery is charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t let the update be resum@@ ed since the phone may be switched on half way and might result in a continuation of the update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read more : iOS 9 release still in the schedule despite the Wat@@ ch@@ OS delay in checking the iOS 9 : this is the least exciting , but the best update from iOS 9 to prepare for the new iPhone OS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should also make sure that you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things , in order to prevent things wrong and develop new productivity features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features built up , speed up and repair the operating system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows the fight for the championship in Formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton , just another motto : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup II was launched before the launch into the crucial seven over@@ see races , that I didn &apos;t lose any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the fourth world champion in front of the desc@@ endant in Singapore on this Sunday from def@@ ending and double @-@ champion Hamilton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Br@@ ite already won seven of the past twelve seasons and took the flood @-@ Grand Prix in the city state , also as a favorite in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
2009 and last year the year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the current smo@@ g in the city state shall influence the Great Prize of Singapore , it is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; established three months ago , the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; has resum@@ ed another member in his ranks , thus the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stopped more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Government of 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation to the chair Alfred Klein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is possible to absorb chess players who can &apos;t record the membership fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
youth work and talk search are also to be pushed .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants to become a club club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his association with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ lau@@ de looks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the centre of Anton@@ ist have merged under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz was opened at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
alongside consultations we can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pursu@@ es down from the mountain in the city center .
precise said on the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new design office was recently opened there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , immediately next to the shopping mall , you receive sen@@ iors and advice information as well as health insurance or services of health and nur@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we are firmly established with our patient nursing service that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not rarely many services of the insur@@ ers are not taken into demand because the complexity of the insurance companies will hardly be understood as Anton@@ assi@@ sts and the City Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service Ama@@ deus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the consultations , the new artist office offers also prevention , health and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sal@@ u@@ dis was then taken into the boat .
so you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherap@@ ist treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offers of the senior centre and Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care ; stated Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new artist offices in the city centre see both business leaders in demo@@ graphic change .
because this creates a good de@@ centr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration ceremony at the inauguration . &quot; there are numerous events and special offerings on the program and this invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Social Foundation has a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent as possible and live well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. , Tu@@ esdays and Thurs@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is a particular team for our team to play against a third party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to have numerous spectators and this is not without reason , because floo@@ ding light has a special appeal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses to the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mon@@ y : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mon@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan army , followed with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young people , cutting himself into the face with his fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when his two friends ha@@ sted and searched on the ra@@ cket , he initially left his victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last young man was brought back home from his friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator then pursued the group with a passenger car up to their dwelling , and drove several demon@@ stra@@ tively several times there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one saw the vehicle no longer , the last before the building was to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a lack of impact , spray on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last had to be taken for medical care in a hospital .
up to now only one vag@@ ue form@@ work is present .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 m in size and dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police ask witnesses and the interpre@@ ter , with the telephone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Frank Müller over practice Fel@@ mat@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
also the mayor of Sam@@ son Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mr. Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert also are pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places on the country , doctors - As@@ endorf are absent : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the next few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a reconstruction phase Müller , Müller opened its practice on October 12 , until then , he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy on first sight , when Frank Müller &apos;s ri@@ ms and his wife told Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who , at present , completed their training in the German Hospital and went to practice in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the land@@ ers would fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was done I just called them . &quot;
the Conc@@ ern@@ ers Müller pleased the idea that in the future there will be an own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive to us . &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old m@@ iller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families &quot; families . &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss .
so they became acqu@@ ainted and the tr@@ ash bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up in Hanover , followed stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently he is active as a Commander in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 , he was appointed Chief ambul@@ ance in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and rel@@ ates to volunteers on the DRC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen as a physician , his wife Ur@@ sel has specialized in the Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müll@@ ers ( both Inter@@ ni@@ sts ) want to settle down as pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy came out therefore &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ence EK@@ Gs and need a language room more .
the ED@@ V will also be completely renewed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disposal of a subsi@@ dy programme of € 50@@ 000 is worth a grant from the district area ( € 25@@ 000 ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and we are , that the practice is resum@@ ed , &quot; empha@@ sizes Zambia artist Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients occur in the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ breaks , in the North German A@@ verage practices around 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another medical practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor could have found it would have been gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , he also visits individuals in familiar faces : the seven medical journals sang and det@@ erg@@ ent from the ri@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their leave at As@@ endorf , an era ended in As@@ endorf , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms . &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen re@@ mun@@ ched .
a little of sad@@ ness drives them after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often see it , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is refresh@@ ed : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; until now I have pressed hor@@ tic@@ es before gardening and now it could be otherwise . &quot;
the couple also likes to have two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are driven to our southern border , &quot; said Internal Affairs Jo@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border were kept parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to claim an asylum request is of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people rise in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept limit@@ less migration rates , nor the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia contempl@@ ates &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had announced earlier refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and they may also continue to er@@ ect cor@@ ridors for the refugees under circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was not the way the interiors of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ bach was not like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia must rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia was already heavily controlled as an outside edge of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Minister &apos;s minist@@ erial , Slovenia wants its borders for refugees but not lock@@ edly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Croatian government ha@@ sted , the first refugees have tried to travel through the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in East @-@ Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian police could re@@ charge them in the near of the corn fields .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , there are constantly police cars with new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is primarily about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would be linked to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serb border which had previously led to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade was susp@@ icious that it is , however , that it is not we can accept certain routes : &quot; neither we can do this , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the run of the day , further buses were expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about Croatia : Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were traveling the whole night of the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary had agreed that , so , the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could actually now come to the forec@@ los@@ ure of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia into a somewhat west , far west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior ministers , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible removal of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not use , but he pointed that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities of control control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one guide rigor@@ ous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , with EU partners and since then a good report on the country as regards the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian border some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to aspects of the media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which after R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border @-@ crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border is un@@ clear yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm on Wednesday early at a local dial , after the Hungarian border is closed , after the Hungarian border is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would not currently deal with very high refugee numbers .
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accessory advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : there are still no cleared min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the Croatian war for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian Police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock market h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als that have been thrown out , since 2010 we have successfully added insights into an un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the targeted information would be made by the insi@@ der business on the financial markets .
by this way they have been aston@@ ished at a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; says the S@@ EC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 more accus@@ ations in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the offen@@ ders should be out both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we are with the action in the middle of the city and among humans , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available for questions and discussions like the volunteer staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some passages take a certain fit to the C@@ rei@@ de approach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can continue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue to continue but say words like &quot; so far I &apos;m not &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , on the edge of small discussions develop the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make a clear decision for me sometime in the end of this world , I can responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ak@@ ic plant Mannheim , who is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ co who is ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this working day is good for the 20 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that not everyone may want to deliver on the tables , except that , handle is a very personal matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and death would be inspired by tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ er movement in recent years has contributed much for the people to open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by personal experience with the subject , it read much literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking to work with the call , she immediately reported and was here in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant offers his earnings view for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight service and higher costs in its boiler service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that it plans to present some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announces that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share fell 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit from 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than with the previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts expected at a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which will be above average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher rates for soil transfers of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it was nevertheless expected to increase earnings from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; solid earnings if you consider the weaker and global trade , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later as the main UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour power equivalent to the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research ordered analysts predi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
analysts expected six of Z@@ acks anticipated 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decrease in international priority shipping that brought sales to its unit express mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for large packages and self insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices while the result was due to higher operating expenses in the cargo business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pre@@ market@@ able trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares at 3,@@ 85 million , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the map is a reminder , that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation in front of all the other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the central bank has a two @-@ way order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed Guide have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this third mandate may be we@@ aned by the X factor in a decision to predicted it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the un@@ preced@@ ented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most data from the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence could only increase the most cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity by raising the interest for federal government - and be it only one quarter percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they observed , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief Econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ k Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were searching for an ob@@ jection to increase the interest rate is the increased uncertainty around the global market enough to wait , &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ure the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed recently from Bloom@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial markets wait , however , a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key element that indicates a 30 % chance on an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a decrease in the stock market if the F@@ ed raise the set , unless the strategy suggests a blow by making it a further increase far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Sustainability Limited jumped at 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed Policy is holding the sentence this week , said by John Lon@@ skis , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the phr@@ ases in this stage , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you do it , they would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so that they should not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argue that a interest rate would calm the financial markets , because the in@@ security of what the F@@ ed would act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow swe@@ eping of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen were said that in this year despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving on the labour market this year was solid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % in the last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near levels where the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation ran constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can master higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but financial markets all over the world began at the end of last month , after China had valued its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dow Jones Sustainability average value fell by more than 16 % among its highest levels , as investors were feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would collapse global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this month the market has slightly re@@ covers in this month , the Dow now amounts to almost 10 % below the heat of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , the market optim@@ ises the complex calculation of complex calculation , when you should increase the interest rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events had not occurred on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of US emer@@ gen@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of in@@ security about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the global economy is none of the main ad@@ vices of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end effect the F@@ ed Monetary Party has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference to the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , says that F@@ ed has ma@@ iled their mon@@ et@@ op expansion &quot; narrow &quot; , spar@@ ked b@@ ump@@ tions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are becoming increasingly alien@@ ated , they can not only monitor developments at another place but also by other central banks and experts advise you to maintain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of super@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently cannot with the economic fundament@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ acker , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , borrow@@ ed for interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to bring their guide to the US by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited notable impact on growth in the US , said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives gave this cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability just as a result of a serious crisis such as the market failure in 2008 , Adam S.@@ P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Interest Dep@@ loy@@ ment of the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest turbul@@ ence isn &apos;t near this level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly you don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of interest rate because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains double deleg@@ ations and does not mention the financial stability until it is changed , I do not believe they should predi@@ ct the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinat@@ own .
yes , Chinat@@ own
the market / the stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is frequently referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale fish market which is also sold to the public .
yes , he is in Chinat@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market / warehouse is a central meeting place and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and Asian snacks , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oils .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the store is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the cor@@ ridors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the whole grocery store makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is located near the outlet and has different recording options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what else is there : do you need anything - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
fresh products embrace Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and lots more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meat et@@ ke is extensive , as well as the fis@@ her - the staff behind the bar is cleaned and fil@@ e@@ eting the fish and even if desired for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive lav@@ atory department . here you find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bit@@ er mel@@ on and g@@ all , pigs , fish , fish poultry , fish saus@@ ages , commercially prepared foods and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who bought it here : re@@ stauran@@ t@@ owner and ch@@ efs but also individual members and individuals .
the wide cor@@ ridors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong D@@ uri@@ an next to the street .
where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinat@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away by Philippe The original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not hard to find a parking lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hosts : little Life Help for Refuge@@ es
more refugees come to Germany this day .
preparing them a warm welcome , does not work without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people supporting the un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is the body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 Len@@ ces they are still teaching them .
every Thursday she is doing the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they also help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is quite different lessons as at a right school .
Brazil &apos;s Pedi@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS attempts to explain how important good nutrition is concerned about how important good nutrition is during the feeding time . you are doing this with presentation of images of babies , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies do all nutrients which need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ oric intake should not be the only di@@ ligent adaptation to make mothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately an un@@ healthy eating of the child may neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ins@@ ul@@ led the building contract for the 2.3 million Euro per sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
planning for long @-@ awaited renovation building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports area is progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent conference session the building contract has been unanim@@ ously locked without significant discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to this , the committee had decided upon a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception &quot; exception &quot; was to permit the permission to form a special form in regard to the roof structure .
thus a &quot; saddle @-@ roof with a non @-@ mit@@ ee first and roof surface should be erected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background : planning is the fore@@ seen use of roof@@ top floor space for solar panels : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by doing so we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , it was said to be prescribed for energy reasons - other than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall will be significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan no &quot; exceptions &quot; , and the Bern@@ rie@@ der community is generally limit@@ edly restri@@ ctive for exemp@@ tion contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not manage the preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gym hall at the Sports Centre is a collabor@@ ative project between the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ward .
about 2.3 million euros are calculated in costs .
subsidies will be expected from school and la@@ titudes promotion .
the next month of trial the building contract for the 18 x 36 meter will now be submitted to the rut@@ iny office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg by Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this will see the surprising plans by the Hospital GmbH of the county of Land@@ kreis in front of which the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Supervisory Board , and the Meeting on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plans should be implemented , all the almost 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority should be moved with fishermen and from the ongoing interior to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms were available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees who can &apos;t be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au in W@@ eil@@ heim will be offered a work@@ station , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change has been triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice near the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the question of who will succeed , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; went on to take over the helm from October 1st and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spreading of the range in &quot; internal medicine &quot; in this case J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board does to ad@@ here to the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ ella , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the county was planned to close it in 2018 if the current restoration is completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , has opened rum@@ ours that is to be used by the Federal Chancellor , to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close off . &quot; how it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say , there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer on the Le@@ ch , who had been taken into a positive and very understanding of the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of medical director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure , divisions have been closed , for instance the surgery and birth@@ days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neckar @-@ Neckar are called on tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in Wuppertal the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga , however , is one of the clear favorite ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last season , the bad@@ ener relative to B@@ HC have a painful defeat and have something good for doing there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jag@@ ap@@ y with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during the maize harvest at the noon after@@ no@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Aber@@ rant hands over a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action as the police told . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a shot of a shi@@ pyard a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were put into hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was un@@ clear .
the police force is determined .
lost 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violence
a crime @-@ susp@@ icious police led the police for 16 year olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old had been killing to have accused young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in rock breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen into the victim &apos;s violence since Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body of the young woman was found in Rock@@ en@@ breaks at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as Public Prosecutor &apos;s Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office and the police on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an active susp@@ ect , a 20 year old musician was also regarded as an energi@@ zer , which led to the statement and investig@@ ators to the discovery of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after they had not arrived home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ en@@ breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators initially ran on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances in friends and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances in the acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances of friends and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances found finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ en@@ breaks , where the body was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the arrest , the authorities informed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police inter@@ ro@@ gation and killed the body in the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought to the ch@@ at@@ eli@@ ers on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay hands on the load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision on the near@@ er circumstances of the fact should bring the other investigations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which has been over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to un@@ cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is a study on behalf of the &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial shelter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them lead to the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es before the apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the negative development of the property market is not only in the rising refugee numbers .
this study also makes considerable failures in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany l@@ ends a budget deficit in front of itself produced by year to year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , some 77@@ ,000 units are currently missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large number of professionals stayed in large cities in large cities .
young adults stayed for the dol@@ drums on the apartment market to volunteer last longer in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capita in the past few years has fallen back for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a new incen@@ tives for social housing .
thus the property tax will be deduc@@ ted and the base rate for supported apartments will be suspended .
an alliance has also been necessary to provide attractive fiscal and depreci@@ ation possibilities .
the funding programme for refugee within the state bank of Kf@@ W comes across from cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start , on Monday evening with 184 million euros had already been available more than half of the available around 300 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia corridor a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no means to come , more refugees choose the way of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit to Slovenia to the north without a hur@@ dle .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia joins the neighboring country of Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian national minister , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ Country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the sealing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
500 people have arrived at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik by the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which entered into force on the same day , over@@ flowing the ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but people don &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police captured the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU N@@ eigh@@ bor@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the media reports according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they came both with the bus and Ta@@ xes in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately upon arrival , they had tried to reach on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the refugees are not defeated by gren@@ ades on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
there is no other danger for this border crossing : there are still rare mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90s .
mine clear@@ ers now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungary , there are hardly any refugees according to the closing of the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday the Police counted 3@@ 66 attacked men .
shortly before the decision on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws indicate over@@ coming and damage of Gren@@ zz@@ ar as an off@@ ence .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged .
arre@@ sts stopped prison sentences up to five years and the deportation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the main transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two older men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , nobody has any prospect that granted asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; secure third land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; tran@@ se@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the workers had begun to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
shut@@ down were degra@@ ded and one of the recording facility in the border town was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express this reconstruction .
Austria is only a few refugees following the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
but the total of 20.000 migrants were still in the country .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for further trips to Germany .
the mig@@ rating traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing there were regularly smaller groups of refugees .
mayor drove &quot; Hurricane &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the elevator , when suddenly ten people were on the tent @-@ entrance door , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists who wanted to go by train to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany was surprisingly low because of the refugee flow in Austria because of the refugee flow in Austria , the Stad@@ ler immediately offered his help and the stran@@ ded cars at the border to the Na@@ he Pas@@ sau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to this we have been trying the uns@@ cal@@ care@@ ous guests only once , with j@@ ause and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we said the same we bring them by car to Pas@@ sau .
&quot; that was of course for us &quot; even as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this was very pleased &quot; so Stad@@ ler told us all the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stran@@ ded train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE train in a regional step in direction of Pas@@ sau , so that the railway traffic was re@@ deployed to Germany but still trying to attempt at the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional train was put off at the edge of W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ crossing is generally high in the course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge @-@ firm joined the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , a two @-@ b@@ re @-@ cycle founded on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now send more tens of thousands to us , a logical result of a apparent field is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather than in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in order to help creating structures , our Chancellor is officially ti@@ ghtened and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian authorities in the Dun@@ st@@ circles of National Soci@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now in the border regions with cha@@ otic states are confronted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wing@@ ed land will also find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; who has invited them and welcomed us , nothing than another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , at which decent conditions for protection are seeking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will still be greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid quar@@ es
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee output .
Christian Konrad is in fact that his word has weight .
the government used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank Ban@@ ker to exp@@ ose qu@@ art for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we didn &apos;t have any homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday would be without great host , said Konrad and praised the organisation &quot; master@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior said by a &quot; Trot@@ sky@@ ist situation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 seals in the hot year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to comply with the number , we need to find 3@@ 5.000 accommodation in the coming weeks - 20.000 the countries should provide , 15.000 of the covenant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should we take more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led conversations with the state capit@@ alists .
they would have secured him to make qu@@ aint for the coming refugees too .
&quot; in Upper Austria it is going well . &quot; he said Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born there should be understood as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations sets the system of asylum , also in the ORF promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform you can accom@@ o@@ date private persons and accommodation .
it is also hopes to be vac@@ ant for hotels in the winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier asked yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of times , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ llery need to hold a certain height of the tu@@ ch@@ iness or height of the hum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; emergency standards &quot; should apply to a temporary stay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast to the Ministry of Home Affairs , he is more successful and laid on Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am an older gentle@@ man whom you cannot speak without further into the face .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conrad and Ma@@ ier create no expense , as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their head@@ count will increase it to three to four .
the artist &apos;s own artist was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted a container at the st@@ ep@@ han@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the first no opening of the urban sport hall and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not necessary to do this at the moment , because persons can currently do under these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other locations for an emergency should be tested on their suit@@ ability .
criticism re@@ iter@@ ates the distribution of refugees in the division of refugees within the Federal Government .
other areas also need to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) the state headquarters Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday announced the further procedure in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however there is now the respective border controls .
they won &apos;t be able to give special tra@@ cts for refugees in Germany anymore .
the su@@ peri@@ ors were however brought to Germany with regular trains .
the other EU Member States has once called for more strengthened solidarity in the refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria is carrying out controls on its borders , is a logical consequence for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Packaging line is officially closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meter ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Group leader Hannes low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in Star@@ tup companies in the new shi@@ pyard and later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - a lot of which is promising : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the site , 3.3 million euros of the Tech@@ Centre , one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is counted from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of rest in the building have already rented out for another 40 per cent of qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
actually Jutta wide wanted to place a dog .
this project had to turn out the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ran@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade . finally it has grown to grow in the shape of another business calendar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the business in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers , all the bags for ladies hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now sold from 75 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it has been rebuilt for several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought about how to open a shop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says broad@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision was decisive for the decision , also that the Fur@@ la producers have been at home from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only in the common area of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your fashion interest has been given wide from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
most likely when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce unit can not answer with the last security .
maybe it is about it that a nice bag is val@@ or@@ tive each outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s ancestors arrived from a village whose inhabitants are called Ad@@ visor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also links some billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the US President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always ready for setting off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he is manifest for alien@@ ation , journalists , or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential election slow@@ ed down the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cut well .
this will also be registered in the el@@ dest town of K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate can come from .
the New Yorker at the con@@ cili@@ e@@ ur is a concept that is about in the wine region .
some of the 1200 inhabitants is related to him about -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt at Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in electoral combat mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del revol@@ ted a film about pumping .
what about the vill@@ agers to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s exciting to me , but they are not so deeply impressed by the kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ es , in which besides Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz is one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , according to the testimony that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is respect@@ ful of the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ders the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a little a w@@ alled , &quot; said Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dently the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in a circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the Ad@@ visor , says she . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pump comes from the village of the investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold min@@ ers in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foundations of the property were first land purchases in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not clear of tragedy : her wish to return to the home , failed on the Bavarian State where the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was not taken with Tr@@ ump because he was once off without permission , the director of the Institute for Ar@@ p@@ aus@@ ing History and Folklore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tre@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken of about Mexican immigrants in the US and asked for the construction of a border dam@@ ned to cover illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like pol@@ em@@ iss@@ ors , this is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative d@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , &quot; Op@@ a was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker measured the Americans rather distance , &quot; he is always so exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ al Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentions how many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ters mentioned that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the church organ in general .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that I don &apos;t think the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t win the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had been to say in the time of his grandfather in the U.S. would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Win@@ cer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not saying it &quot; says she .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ end@@ el film , for the Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 kin@@ e@@ ang@@ gers , and also in the US awak@@ ens the interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavaria municipality of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the hand of the Vice President in the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already 20 &quot; mountain @-@ climb &quot; in Austria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighboring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings despite attempts from Nine to take the loss of leadership in Today &apos;s show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson to report to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has no big sli@@ vals in ratings for Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the breakfast show of Nine was premi@@ ered by the federal capital as a Malcolm Turn@@ halle on the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , which also included Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , in comparison to today 3@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , a slight increase over ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today in the last months the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , today became an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Sun@@ rise stood on average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators at Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning people more than the Parliament !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former grave from Mon@@ to the Raf@@ ik Erik Thom@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama on a recent we@@ aned father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached an impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could have had a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X Fac@@ tor of Seven was strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators , and smote the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and TB@@ L Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators ( from 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators , enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20.000 spectators and in the second half hour to 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will confi@@ dently agree that hot @-@ se@@ at will finally prevail around 17 : 30 pm .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which is not managed to spur the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .
originally published as &apos; Sun@@ rise &apos; while Today remains locally &apos;
the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have consciously recognized who wins the bach@@ elor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the woman in which Sam Wood has ended up in a bach@@ elor &apos;s death with Sam Wood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up , whether she is the one who has received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we checked to Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , before three two will be checked , you may have acci@@ dentally obtained a suggestion that will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam Wood has sealed his lips until the finale on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left out ly@@ rical , why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , am@@ bition , family and positive attitude to reason why they would like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; If not , who would win W@@ oods Last Rose ? &quot; could their answers to gambling , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every fast on Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki they called themselves fast - except for himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I felt that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah says at her feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mar@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that her husband &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; could be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m so off@@ ended on him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when asked , whom Wood should choose if they were not , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that . &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the bach@@ elor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ es had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams , who sent en@@ quiries after an impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some instruc@@ tors have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game as he lost a comm@@ otion , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband , and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return on a punch return and also in the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in changing rooms at the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of grinding your R@@ ook@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ es publicly in his press conference after the play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ Reporter Cam In@@ man noted that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who told him to take his lost catch and take care of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ es pat@@ ched with a pun@@ t that was re@@ inst@@ ated in the first quarter of the Minnesota .
it certainly was not the start to have been hoping for Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian talent for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ ton 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a thing which is common now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ n compared the car@@ ver with his Origin at that time in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger urged the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria as it was during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we don &apos;t go on , we have to go to the causes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Syrian chief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
free asylum seek@@ ers want to postp@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for administrative matters that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but that is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion around the loads from the nuclear phase increased the shares of RW@@ E to a record deep , and left deep wounds during E@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Spiegel &quot; the German energy companies may collect 30 billion euros on provisions .
the federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recover somewhat , but ultimately , always 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after demonstr@@ ating the rubber soil into a crowd that proposed the proposed new constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the violence collapsed on Tuesday evening at the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district . 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ nu P@@ ras@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leader district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were assembled outside of a police station , some of which threw stones and fire@@ bom@@ bers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police have fired Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then fired into the air before returning to rubber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
20 police officers and five civilians were injured and he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber flo@@ urs , known of them that they can kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict was the last in weeks violent protests in Nep@@ tun southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces created in the framework of proposed new constitution would reduce their policy influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were protests in the western Nepal of the C@@ arus &quot; ethnic group who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people including 11 police officers have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has reigned over centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ l@@ ature accelerated the process of devastating earthquake that thousands of people killed in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ l@@ ature voted for certain clari@@ fications in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ der Art Centre is to be built again .
the town is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mixture of trade , trade and housing - there is not concrete offers yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den will market an approximately 4000 square meters large plot in direct proximity to the Art Centre Alte Post .
preparations are currently underway .
it is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you wait for relevant offers - it is said on the part of the city .
which investor I ask is not clear yet .
no contracts were concluded accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is at the Ring@@ straße / corner Big Street even a few months ago , and the buildings stopped by it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
planning of a holiday village at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor has publicly exhibited public plans for the project .
several An@@ li@@ eger are more troubled - they fear the sale of their free refuge
for months behind closed doors was twi@@ sted , gre@@ ed , deb@@ ated and marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday village are located at the Little Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interest of interest , the medium @-@ sized em@@ ash@@ ment of the Company &quot; System construction , presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point was originally on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , Ralf Behr@@ mann drew from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t asked any questions to the question , &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours .
this project has stood at the debate about ten to twelve million euros for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intense reactions under hor@@ se@@ man owners , who came to the meeting , cried the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea owners and board member at the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge kl@@ ist that over@@ looks all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he fears several other project critic@@ isms that the traffic would increase by the proposed size of the plant : &quot; all bus loads are required to do so , &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens exactly on the well @-@ hectare estate of the former inn , is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept . &quot; Ralf Behr@@ inger said .
because this still lack@@ ed the development plans were still variable .

O ) announced a double donation campaign that will help the thousands of refugees to over@@ roll the thousands of refugees since they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach when disclosure of donations in his blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of making an managers who had to make an announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , who escaped from Kabul and fled to her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our journey many dark web and buses belonged to star@@ vation , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations to provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refuge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global money collected up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com , up to 11 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four years of civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many are escaped from the Afghanistan : Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for light @-@ weight diabe@@ tics can be helpful loss of weight loss .
the advantages of weight loss facial surgery for lightweight - obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people live with diabetes after losing weight loss than those who receive non surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; says Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss of surgery which wrote a Editorial about the new Study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , O@@ bes@@ ity geri@@ es have proved efficient to treat type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been performed with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher in patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BMI , a basic weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people who have a BMI more than 30 are obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers used in Taiwan are the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ch@@ lau@@ tern - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BMI of the average BMI ranges from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the BMI remained with those who were non surgical diabetes treatments were equal to 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under those , subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of diabetes disease was completely dissolved and 28 % partly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was entirely dissolved by just one percent and partly only about two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and &quot; poor &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also monitor the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent by the researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c acid decreased by approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this enhanced &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level , does not dimin@@ ished the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also provides average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) compared to greater over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e people who under@@ gone an O@@ bes@@ ity operation , about 29 per cent less likely dying in the course of 15 years - compared to a group whose conventional methods tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new trial was not an advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people who are interested in a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , without higher risk of death or kidney disease , said them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors do start to take weight seriously , as the patient should have a BMI between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we take people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have committed their bodies to obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a theme , which is often referred to as a contemp@@ t in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and imp@@ ud@@ dly , meets her youth after years , and this fall in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story the novel may be interesting above all for H@@ uns@@ be@@ cker &apos;s readers as he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler , pleased that she could place a literary monument to her home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe can &apos;t welcome all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East fly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide said to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be made against the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries was ad@@ mira@@ ble on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the Dalai Lama &apos;s German and Austria efforts at the attack of the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , it is wonderful but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never resolved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented about George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and issued a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events that with@@ drew from un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush &apos;s letter , and I told him the way to resolve this issue lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he sat down violence , and this gave rise to unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increase of drop@@ down increase of disinf@@ ect@@ ant &apos;s disinf@@ ect@@ ant mothers in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of drinking the strongly alcoholic hand@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ( see Georgia Po@@ ison Center ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years of age , the tox@@ in control centers report from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them walk in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that several children of disinf@@ ect@@ ant may drink , while some people do to impress their friends or because of a tasting in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ant may drink only because of a cheap experience .
young@@ sters have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant mixed with alcohol and drink in order to obtain a tough@@ er beverage .
younger children can be so@@ lic@@ ated by attractive flav@@ ours of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it . &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange juice that are very attractive to children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disinf@@ ect disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few inj@@ ectors can also lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Federal University of Kansas , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t have a sip of whis@@ ky ; but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children and if children are coming from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl that had recently taken four sy@@ ringe barrels of water disinf@@ ect@@ ant was taken into school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their blood sugar concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Ri@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ut@@ te her words and was not able to go when it arrived in the distress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors have supervised them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and led to the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants to store and disinf@@ ect disinf@@ ect@@ ant outside the child &apos;s reach .
about alcohol pois@@ oning also some disinf@@ ect@@ ant associated with deaths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario , women died after the swal@@ lowing of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
employees of health authorities susp@@ ects that the product meth@@ anol contained a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol that was not@@ ated as an active substance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state New York aimed at pois@@ oning her &quot; vile &quot; teacher related to the classroom , thus reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergi@@ es to disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the eit@@ ed plan as &quot; gos@@ sip , &quot; and promised disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a dri@@ v@@ eway on the cross @-@ gap between northern ring and up , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was slightly hurt in a dri@@ v@@ eway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove off the cross @-@ gap in the direction of the industrial area , and was too late that on round@@ about two ahead cars had stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the episode , he pi@@ ped off with his truck to the stern of an audience and whether this car is standing by Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident @-@ affected vehicles was an harm of about 10 000 Euro , the police spl@@ its it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Audi since the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding : no dis@@ cord at Celtic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of di@@ vin@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , D@@ eil@@ a gives to that the Ho@@ ops come in a bad place , but that he will let this go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

d@@ ons increase leadership by Celtic to five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first half @-@ time , Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meters had a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there was rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow - what was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ Smith &apos;s spontaneous movement . this insi@@ sted that he and his team @-@ mates will not stand under greater control as it is preparing for the confron@@ tation with the Dutch charts guide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bo@@ res Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former championship @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the leader@@ boards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they will show no highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they are talking about both teams together and that is what they are interested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of voltage in the old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will turn around the things while swe@@ ars out D@@ eil@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RON@@ NY D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic himself has to fight , but the Norwegian chief s@@ wore to change things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 @-@ man out of Aber@@ deen , now clearly followed the five @-@ point lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; Celtic had already had bad days before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as fast as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we just feel it - but we must continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now working is important .
War@@ bur@@ ton caution in January @-@ transfers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , the Boss boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is carefully during the signing of Neu@@ rolog@@ ist and insi@@ sted that he doesn &apos;t want to dis@@ rupt the unity of the ep@@ ho@@ x ca@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex @-@ head of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players who come in summer have this pre@@ season time to integrate , which you have seen with our own group in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crew is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to add what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son has left what he said , and waited , &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have commented on no performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Interior said , &quot; There is no crew that won all have won in Po@@ kal@@ es or Li@@ es , who won &apos;t won the games of this kind also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged and rising overall in the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without employment for the United Kingdom has risen to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent , Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.5 percent , as shown in the statistics for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile employment in Scotland increased by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent in the course of the quarter - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures , saying : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly one year ago , that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have witnessed further improvements on the Scottish labor market with increasing employment and a decline of unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drunk distur@@ bing the procedure
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the security personnel did not maintain the situation , the staff asked the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the blast .
a breath @-@ alcohol produced a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .

why I am to be a Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something later today , except in the late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip is executed by the toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation took place already in January for his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the day approached me I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the U.S. , and there are often more applications available as places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere Lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who is chosen who will run it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Richard Glos@@ sy , I will sit in my own relationship with which I developed my own relationship with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t see a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to draw a not@@ ep@@ ad and pen that I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of conscience how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they noticed that she could have form@@ ulate it better , but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wants an international repor@@ ter present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the publicity work of the movement shall help against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware was a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post there will be sitting next to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I can &apos;t tell you that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ esis , would blame him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the fact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will see him from that perspective .
I can &apos;t pret@@ end to be truly objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters in which you can turn to that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to see a man unnecessary dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he over@@ laid the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt of a man of Perth , to the police , was successful , when he was found in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , trying to exc@@ el him gently to tran@@ scribe to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a local gra@@ iny incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , this one tried to escape the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stable salmon into Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too fond of making his uniform , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to try &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Master @-@ football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , Cou@@ sins drove his car into the ditch to avoid a alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired local locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ ying him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy said that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables , threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he quoted the ste@@ wards and the Integ@@ rity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ y due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself had found himself under difficult circumstances when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ dress rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is he couldn &apos;t explain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying on criticism , and did not want it &quot; look like &quot; high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say nothing about it , but sometimes I did so frustr@@ ated , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live thereby what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will go home tonight and well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to walk around the head , and I would like my owners to think I try my best for her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start to think , I do not do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , Moo@@ dy had taken the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , that the guard division had tried to sp@@ ying his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the ei@@ ghte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart will be able to appoint him for information about what I &apos;m doing in my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that &apos;s the case , they should certainly hold their n@@ oses because it is trying to hold me out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of RV@@ L , has become aware of that time and still are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should I bring this to the opinion that it is personally done ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does the Route L concern themselves , and perhaps people outside train@@ ers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people are thinking out there because I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take me my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say they should think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them , and push for them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the training levels of the train@@ ers have built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he was able to throw his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by his preparation of the Com@@ preh@@ end Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the Rac@@ ec@@ ary treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay has been applied to the b@@ umps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take full responsibility for this . &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my employees did acci@@ dentally put mud on the leg .
it would have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday - which was so .
but it had so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package at the racing day . an investigation of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested for driver Cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man in a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that , drivers continued to stop without stopping , in order to help the injured rider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man made by Nathan the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be indicted and subjected to other traffic light because of driver cur@@ s@@ cur@@ ses and sub@@ class@@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight ri@@ vals for claims of ring struggle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has asked criticism of the Tac@@ tical his players as the &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will be allowed to win the Storm players &quot; ring competition with his team during the High Storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett , after his crew set the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; Mu@@ ster@@ case &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land won &apos;t be too good in the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ack@@ bu@@ g of his team and said that she was only concentrated on her &quot; touch . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team confi@@ dently agree , as it means that they were worried about to be defeated by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ ers when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we have made nothing in our def@@ ensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has produced the trend revers@@ al for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not getting used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is funny as this is always appearing at this time of season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy was attacked by the &quot; thrilling football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that Benn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons survived the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was &apos; he said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s the ball@@ game which you want to play if you &apos;ve got this kind of players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build confidence , because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago did not think of us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the Mac version against Roo@@ ster recorded a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or are breaks and do not have any points of tension ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet again in one phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm @-@ Team is free on this weekend as they have gained the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts the next service tomorrow .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit to drug cl@@ ause
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who could eventually thre@@ aten a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get hold of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were smu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , was released against a damage deposit of 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was 29 who was one of the five men detained in the last month after the Federal Police arrested 100 kg of the drug on V@@ anu@@ atu in August and in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed like he met his co @-@ accused in the course of the morning and later met in the cafe Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a potentially life imprisonment for an attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c did not give evidence that he would have been no evidence whatsoever he could have been a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of practice at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia . &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the pen@@ al , he lied to the police across its residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the increased explanations of these two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 Dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this alone will not go out to hold him away , not to appear , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released upon deposit , under the conditions that he dis@@ agreements his Australian and his Serbian passport to stay at the police every day and keeps following a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accident in A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cabin swe@@ eps apart
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a dri@@ v@@ eway with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 , a truck driver was seriously injured during the evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the three parties involved in the direction of Basel had slow@@ ed in the direction of Basel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noticed it late and tried un@@ successfully , in the final moment devi@@ ates into the left , as the police told them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab is completely isolated .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed in six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a damage amounting to 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure p@@ ests to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand photos of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s telephone when she was asleep in an online mess@@ aging service which was given a series of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through that conf@@ using messages and alar@@ ming their mother immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed the computer that were found under the address , and discovered the relevant web research that used to search for in@@ consistent images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed that he would have done it , since it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests in the Internet , &quot; and he then gave them to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a diction that he is addi@@ cted to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the search on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are p@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he did so to enti@@ ce her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that he was sick in his head when he drinks , and he said , he wants to see images of rape and mur@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was with her trem@@ bling and with tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she then looked at the telephone , con@@ front the def@@ endants , and con@@ front the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant used to use computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation , to speak to girls who saw a lot younger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense attorney Gregory S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of sexual off@@ ences , as it might be argu@@ ing that there was no considerable sexual element in his passing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Stuttgart : front of a Trop@@ enst@@ ock &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists are waiting in front of storm in the south west of Wednesday afternoon .
the German weather station ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart is currently flowing through western air currents in the country because of a low pressure area on Western Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful T@@ low is the for@@ erunner of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ry &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intense storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD is still Thursday morning also in the Black Forest in the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Lake Constance with ar@@ ches of 60 to 90 kilometers kilometers .
the Friday is therefore no longer able to look into the sun again .
the mass makes it : all two years show the bus at the IAA for their novel@@ ties .
2015 is mainly used to take part in the wag@@ on vehicles that are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , cars from the compact class are currently particularly important : around 2@@ 8.1 percent of the new regi@@ strations will be dropped by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars will be presented especially many new compact models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available in the autumn by the dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to sell the volume model also well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel presents a step below the biggest competi@@ tor to the VW Golf in view , which starts at € 17 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 Euros .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only a fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi year which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?

the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo power and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are un@@ worthy of humans
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court declared a former prisoner of the judicial institution , which was placed for months in a small cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of her human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation if they are lodged in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision has taken the Federal Constitutional Court in an official decision on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may even hope to hope for money , if only a few days in the narrow rooms were imprisoned ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this meant an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with its constitu@@ ency in Karlsruhe , which was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres of ground between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man was now back to his birth on the free foot , moved to a bigger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his detention room was failed due to the un@@ worthy prison conditions against the Land of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Constitutional Court presi@@ ded over the ruling by the Court of App@@ eal in Berlin and transferred to the case for re @-@ examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber Court now decides over the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although legal reasons only a few days of adh@@ es@@ ion for compensation should be author@@ itative , it was called an ob@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise it would be &quot; worry of the right protection of personality . &quot;
the chamber Court must now clari@@ fy the amount of compensation .
the Constitutional Court have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus they only said in April to in@@ mate in@@ dem@@ nity , because he was imprisoned in a prison cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deser@@ un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 , according to the majority de@@ fle@@ ction of a cell with no separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner in a parallel case , confirmed a decent seat in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former se@@ wage was accommod@@ ated over three months daily between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been in the head@@ lines for the past few weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners are therefore always returned to 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to hits , shall be due to the strained location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information about the judicial press there are 21 places in Te@@ gel because of young insufficient funds should not fall away from 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior by Germany , according to the statement of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the unusual challenge , Chancellor Angela Merkel shows that &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany do the following overview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; needed , after different forecasts between the Federal Ministry of Education and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space is dramatically - especially with paid rental objects . every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing are out of lease @-@ demand , and in order to apply for these particularly adv@@ anta@@ geous apartments to apply even refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double up to € 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year , and therefore , the federal government would have to invest € 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists and ministers agree that there must also be more control benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , over the long @-@ term 55 percent of residents can be employed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in Germany the refugees in Germany were asked not even systematically in their qualification to help them out as a result , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find them in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating the este@@ em in the admission company but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ rant researcher , Thr@@ ott@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Thr@@ ott@@ hardt , a political turn gave rise : from the labour ban for refugees to recognition from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while it used to ban the asylum seek@@ ers for asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months , just like the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers restricted to a residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , itself - even because of the permanent struggle - the vision of refugees was forced , that refugees should be swi@@ ft faster on the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing knowledge of German .
so far there is no appeal to common and professional @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most frequently communicated by personal contacts .
the creation of networks is therefore according to the Thr@@ ur@@ hardt of the royal path to the employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School Administration has noted that only a few subjects can enter their children into the kit@@ es , with an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for ent@@ ren@@ ched parents it is only very important to keep the family together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ em@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to convince the family of the advantages of Kit@@ a , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ lers in various languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the need for educ@@ ators should rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - roughly speaking even more technical colle@@ ges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students are welcome as a welcome bonus in the countries and are prepared for classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not always taught by teachers and teachers , but also taught by teachers who only have a qualification in German as second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no short@@ age of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ em by the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Deutsche Student Association predic@@ ts that roughly 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle no federal or asylum seek@@ ers or imp@@ lic@@ ated studies - the only exception was Berlin , interior ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) now has given up his attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studio will@@ ingness to facilitate access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence permit or dung , no performances are given after the asylum seek@@ ers law more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter will generally not get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G because it does not fall under the number of b@@ other persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to date , the refugees had to have lived for four years to be eligible for BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G to be eligible for 15 months from 1 January 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science and the German Student Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should be gradually joining the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches are to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association which will be professional for the new@@ com@@ ers .
rights belong to the rights also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representative of Islam must unite in clear contact persons and willing to work with the state in many areas and conc@@ eive some control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the read@@ iness to domin@@ ate religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern for the wor@@ ries , religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany immediately , &quot; immediately decided their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic around the whole society in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the majority society must change , the breakdown of discrimination and racism is har@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination and a general law of equality for almost a decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it gets very slowly , like the NSU race series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racial motive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and stakeholders do not demand a long time , and they must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is capable of supplying the previously expected refugees to provide medical responsibility Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ aci@@ ties , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it needed to flow additional money into the system .
to avoid narrow bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to all the new@@ lings at the time of registration health cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these services could be calculated later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited power catalog covering the asylum seek@@ ers protection act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the doctors perform mainly the language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , so far the Berlin health scientists The@@ a Bor@@ de are found , migrants are worse than their illnesses more than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interpre@@ ting costs should not be taken over in hospitals as well as in medical practices .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
under refugee camps for example there are much more un@@ treated disabilities ; and in the young people there are HIV education .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some other clinical pictures , German doctors comes from her apprentic@@ eship as well , writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite decay or tuberculosis are not that difficult to recognize . &quot; and what harm is perhaps even alle@@ vi@@ ating in sight by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syrians have had a high @-@ developed educational system ; many refugees are even doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to practice , they would have to prove their qualification and perhaps again complete their tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is ill sick for estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) . most suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress condition or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly vulnerable to refugee community , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by TU Munich is that each fifth attack in Germany is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress condition suffers from among others on so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory tract , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ p@@ ans and death toll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong aci@@ ousness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent symptoms of chronic symptoms , a early treatment would be necessary , &quot; Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees get an psych@@ otherapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , psych@@ ologically ill @-@ seek@@ ers can put an application for psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually lasts several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained in psych@@ ical diseases , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
the circus falls back on the traditions of the circus art with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion . &quot;
the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and its unique entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the circus invites Pro@@ bst in the ring on a brick and was@@ hes to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine without living my Circus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a passion &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ witness st@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift to the delight of the family lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take away people from their daily basis and take them to a completely different world for two hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world @-@ city fla@@ ir &quot; - says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometers long tour , this fla@@ ir can now experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circus programme convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent at the international circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with it &apos;s joke and charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
the Cuban duo wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
ease and flexibility - identify them with these words .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is going to conquer the storm in the storm .
except through numerous salmon salt fascin@@ ates the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also with sensitivity and joint effort .
to balance the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sna@@ ke people fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and fascinated with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ ani@@ es &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the position of circus are only too often topic with various animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes care of : &quot; if our animals isn &apos;t good , it is also not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every p@@ etting unit about 80 animals from five different continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read after every wish from the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel comfortable if it doesn &apos;t want to get into the ring either .
thus the first commandment is : good for the animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially for their zeb@@ ra JU@@ MBO , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony belt and a zeb@@ ra@@ mare , family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two animals have lived in a fence for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then suddenly it was our little jum@@ bo there , &quot; Brigitte explains Pro@@ bst .
the Zeb@@ roid is not ready for the ege but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is sure , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst charges the performances between 17 and 20 September daily at 17 : 20 pm .
the program starts on Sunday at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the ti@@ lt daily is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ a Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr. Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening has also been clou@@ ded by declar@@ ations of opposition members , that they would have received anonymous death threats and were warned against Mr Mu@@ gabe and Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month they had seized him and interrupted him , during his speech , the State of the State was interrupted - this is what he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ makers may receive SMS messages on their mobile phones , which they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she asked the title &quot; Death , &quot; he spoke to repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warn the people affected , that the immunity held in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to grow to 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in the scope of restructuring , savings and savings in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP will split later into two listed companies this year , and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its value @-@ performance business activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected reduction of jobs will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP used in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead to the unity of separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused on the HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses who support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and is based on providing un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; so an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , where the Palo Alto Garage man is called the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring process to successfully master the turn of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US tech companies is based in this area , based on the belief that foc@@ uss@@ ing close focused enterprises can deliver better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to be behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger was empha@@ sized against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere won at least the next four games for England and considering its history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had completed the last season following a separate ank@@ le injury , and then back again to its old swing during the pre@@ season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career &quot; says W@@ enger .
it is a bone that is not good .
it is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in connection with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries which he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that may be true from a medical point of view , but like W@@ enger also appreci@@ ates there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant patterns .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ os@@ ene Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he played more in only 65 from arsen@@ ic players in the last five game times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the broader picture of Arsenal is that in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs , who have noted most of the injury days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement at the vulner@@ ability during the last season is growing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have an an@@ tim@@ ed time frame which you have to strengthen your body and win fight force , &quot; W@@ enger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of this kind , which he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal will start his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and W@@ enger is a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not come to Croatia when Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta may start .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to hold the balance and to the players who require a little break @-@ break , &quot; W@@ enger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where the Richter scale was measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that arsen@@ al moved out of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains far from the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first European market triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship F@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy Show - who grants us serious lessons with men &apos;s clothes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now even more desper@@ ate than ever , to prove suicide among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ d ( CA@@ LM ) campaign against a committed suicide in 2015 , aim@@ ing to ask the men to question the men from asking them if they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms announced that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for those who are not depres@@ sive to hal@@ ve a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to work for friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the era of social media , with its main emphasis on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than an important contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , full of life and successful , even if the isolation was domin@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ in@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all on cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained that money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of a Friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which g@@ lowed through the interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football in cozy chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can relate to each case , even if they often hold their feelings to explore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a member of the telephone call , it explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening team for people who are de@@ pressed and sin@@ ful at risk , really showed me how the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the men , who contact us , often feel not able to speak with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you speak about issues openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friends is one of the shows that comes in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this clearly presents the small moments of male friendship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so very my objective field status about the phone to help people in sight of desp@@ air may also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you attend this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with commemor@@ ating the Day to celebrate the newly created setting , why not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , even better if you look around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to trace Malm@@ ö in Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and David son Cav@@ ani after his engagement against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angel Di Maria and David son Cav@@ ani held course that Paris Saint @-@ Germain took his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ ing@@ on on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players , who achieved the French Masters on the way before they finally succeeded in playing their advantage , when Cav@@ ani scored one header in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A need Paris a strong start against the Swedish Master when it is not only interested in the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ i@@ movi@@ cs had missed opportunity ahead of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hometown @-@ team and against the club with which he already started his / her career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or out into the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to take out our opponents and relax , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it we didn &apos;t have scored one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bra@@ zi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ team , which was able to keep on their own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was em@@ itted in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Argentine wing was referred to as the man to take the PS@@ G on the next level in Europe , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö pass before he finished in the long corner of the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , that was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit that this level occurred at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field , and with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field sw@@ ings a heavy opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they bot@@ en little in attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G themselves did not appear occasionally , with some patches and poor inclu@@ sions , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c in the first half and then after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he re@@ proved a lot more skill when he turned his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the poles ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate finally fell just after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , where I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had picked up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game and only a great intervention from Wil@@ and out of no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz ( end result ) managed to stop the end result before substitute judge Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been finished at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de said that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League play was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the quali@@ fications do not range . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE accum@@ ulates 2.5 billion $ from stock sales
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based in Switzerland , the G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE resident , which is affected by stor@@ y@@ ological prices , collected $ 2.5 billion through a stock selling as part of its huge debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company G@@ LE@@ N@@ CO@@ RE , registered in London , stated that there has sold new shares worth around 1.6 billion in order to pay his own debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola blocked the transition to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi play in Qatar since the summer of 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at Barcelona FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times of Spanish Champion , three times champion Champions League , two times championship runner , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is simply breathtaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona to join the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca d@@ ei@@ t X@@ avi , he said that he was already standing before the EM 2008 before departure from Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid was at that time we didn &apos;t tell anything about it . &quot;
and that also known as FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Romanian wanted me to have me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change over
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man currently works for the German record champion : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has brought Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP has told me that I wouldn &apos;t change , that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has gotten me with that . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ aria has run in the 2008 / 2009 season with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter of the Champions League against the Bayern of the whole distance on the lawn and turned red from the red top ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s victory at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film shooting
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ making Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said they will not be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light interrupted the experienced actor Brown , on this the necessity of alternative perspectives stressed and more on a black protag@@ onists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; secured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay . &quot; as the comments of the actor in The Mar@@ tian would captiv@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - who will be always the director , as she will discuss the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te who is beaten by her white d@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to film ; Dam@@ on answered that there could be something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded about Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni , expressed his anger over the clip , talking to &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - SO W@@ ING that it &apos;s hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et deser@@ ved more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 li@@ kes since its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments are coming at a time when there is a racial representation in the media at the top of social discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black lives matches and authorities , discri@@ min@@ ated practices against colour content areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince presented a recording onto the movement during the launch of the Year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album was matt , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums are still their importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more recently , leaders of the Black lives Mat@@ ter have released an explanation , while respon@@ ding to the question of the Fox News person@@ age Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group was to be regarded as a hate group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group &quot; said the leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to discuss the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope ? it is un@@ clear .
the American Ninja Warrior is the first champion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional sports@@ man and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition Show , which finished its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participants that could complete all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the season there are two men , cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman ge@@ off B@@ ritten to the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the climbing climb on a 75 @-@ foot cable in 30 seconds to climb during the last task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ritten completed the task within the period , which he completed the first ath@@ lete , which ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge three seconds faster than the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages sent to the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or her life , &quot; Isaac E said ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent WE@@ ED sat down with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he did not receive any prize money at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , one gets the one with the fastest time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said WE@@ ED . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think he cher@@ ish a grove in it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
crowds received from fans of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be defeated by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac had felt the same way if they had ver@@ ted the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ps in Minnesota T@@ wins past
mini @-@ based L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the Tig@@ ers stand on the last square in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but it took place on Tuesday with the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins already prescri@@ bes a chance to climb up within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F Word , which was so hard to gras@@ p about a big part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all victories do fun not matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support , in Detroit three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again at the ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck for 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside , and made it possible for three R@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year : &quot; Simon said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to throw in the Bull@@ pen every game , and so I will completely concentrate in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designed Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is , since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits for the Seattle Navy on July 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has stra@@ pped the ra@@ mmer well , &quot; said er@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better from the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the seventh month , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ ds Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double in the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Right Fiel@@ ds Aaron H@@ icks reached a colored , and Simon produced his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ c to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Har@@ dy survived the wall and the only man with whom he was confronted with the designated R@@ ook@@ ie demo@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who was handed out an Two @-@ Run on the right handed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the finished Run on the second hand , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third bass player to play Double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the 27th time in this season , which pl@@ ou@@ ches hit a Double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Detroit added a Insurance Policy at the end of ninth door she added a R@@ BI @-@ double to the closer line of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed sto@@ op@@ ed however S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit offered the match of the game of an even non @-@ moving Phil Hugh@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ right veter@@ an veter@@ an , who had been cancelled prior to the game from the injury list , after having been missing for more than one month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Mr Hugh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I got started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first one gave him a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
one pair @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made its 0 @-@ 21 record series with lap in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ que Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third end that the threat ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tig@@ ers placed the second @-@ out Double @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow &quot; says T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t get so well done but he caught the right job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hugh@@ es was in the Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning , before it has been replaced by the Rel@@ e@@ ver Re@@ chtsh@@ ani@@ ster of A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Hugh@@ es there was three hits with six hits and one walk with four re@@ ke@@ outs .

hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the most fortified people will then be accommod@@ ated in shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden as the city of Wiesbaden at the Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 upcoming refugees .
several sporting heroes of the H@@ es@@ sian capital have been prepared for this event last days .
up to 1000 refugees can be signed temporarily .
they should then be shared on other communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past ten days alone , according to the initial director G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Frankfurt and Han@@ au have furnished shel@@ ters for the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I believe the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options cannot be held without Germany . &quot; he said .
he cast the European states &quot; collective agre@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , one has been pleased that the cup was passed by military participation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the conflict broke out in front of our front door . &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive boost to international aid for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria also introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station on Tuesday , Hungary , and now no one is sent back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Germany did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; explained it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already given talks between the General Manager for Public Safety and Represent@@ ative of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete figures did not give them and rejected them on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees came through the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ man requested a special summit for next week with several other EU leaders and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the EU states have not yet to agree on a joint progress in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers would like to take a new arrival for the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the strong refugee ship in Germany , the Federation wants to support the countries with the first up@@ take and distribution of men stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wai@@ st@@ band will manage this together with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour advis@@ ing with the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Merkel under@@ line those people who would need protection ; they express this one too .
but who doesn &apos;t have a lead @-@ bound account could not remain in Germany either .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whoever wants to take care of its slender line , often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : in them B @-@ vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. Because of all , Mang@@ os contains a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone e@@ ats the fruit which supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when purchasing man@@ go Mang@@ os should not be too soft or to smell and smell pleasantly .
the paint color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit - so can taste green man@@ go delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it alle@@ vi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of leaf salads like chi@@ co@@ ree and radi@@ c@@ cio .

first bo rush , then striking cold front . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night breaks down the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ese side of the Föhn , on Tuesday like Met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and night on Thursday , the Föhn blows with a storm to the shaft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able on Thursday morning , a striking cold front crosses the strong rain falls , wind gu@@ sts and a slight decline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive background area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southern we@@ ster@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Alpine side breaks through the valleys on the night across the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the row , the Föhn blows up to 100 km / h in the cave , occasionally also in the jungle with over 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hair dryer can penet@@ rate down to the adjacent centre , and even the mountains and mountains of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the alpine rock begins to be du@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here rain set up until Thursday night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter , having fallen great rain in the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning , the blow leaves the air into a cold front with powerful , partly heated rain from West to east via Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the cold front , the wind picks up the wind up to stor@@ my and the temperatures rise sharply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , on the south , however , it becomes sun@@ k and warmer at up to 25 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther place
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , Rome now exists a Martin @-@ Luther place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of the honorary President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino was baptized , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honored as a &quot; German the@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ esp@@ ace was applied for the work of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded the fact that Protest@@ ants could only live in the town of the pop@@ es over centuries as a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the square , I symboli@@ ze that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome may be welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he then found the city back as a comment down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to histori@@ ans , after histori@@ ans took him in his later fight against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luther had subsequently initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es .
Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gild@@ ed ) thorn crown is one of the main pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has appeared with splendid images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful forms obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but this is by no means equal with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary : the individual topics adapted , this may quite a glo@@ omy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked in his Bible project , for which he has met a subjective and artistic selection of the many subjects &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the arose , cycles , such as crosses , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is spontaneous immediately to several partners : that applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is mainly based on painting with the following quot@@ ations .
he interpre@@ ts the interpre@@ tations of the selected Bible by Ot@@ mar Alt and comp@@ ile in today &apos;s current link@@ ages . &quot;
these texts are like the verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nestled between the original Bible Council , Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who set his personal thoughts about the situation here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry band has golden letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double gli@@ mpse into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , emotion in the Bible @-@ project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and incar@@ cer@@ ated in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Christian Order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the education went to the cane cane , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ work that to bring me back to the Father &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second query is to help art in a faster time more than ever : &quot; the perception of pictures is characterized by claims , and that is noisy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different delight and delight to show things .
images always have something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wishes to let the viewer move into the images , look out , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was closed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he mat@@ ures with his images . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old , I have not considered the Bible to fully gras@@ p the Bible , but also selected for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was not a collaboration at eye level &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures ; the text explains only . &quot; it was a photo @-@ Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life &quot; deep@@ en and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for mut@@ ations both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn na@@ ves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans were made , space found , company commissioned to mod@@ ulate the earth for a round rate : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration provided for dr@@ ills , especially in the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hills have been slo@@ ping out new space - now with formal planning and request for building permission .
the permission will enter in October was the first municipal council of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach &apos;s Bock now in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; I hope that this year happens again . &quot; she said .
it should then be started without &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies involvement in refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga deals a clear sign on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football reacts to a well @-@ looking location in Germany , and ensures the policy help its help in addressing the problems with the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s the greatest challenge for our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that is nothing wrong with me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get this issue in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m on the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State for O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role &quot; he announced .
the soccer can help and want to help .
the decisive dish needs to put politics .
the German football League has therefore expanded his refugee @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have guaranteed that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA Cup in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already at this weekend , the 36 profession@@ al@@ ers set a clear sign when they are carried out on the left tri@@ cot Car@@ tri@@ cot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We can help - # Refuge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that everyone can help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Os@@ i Compl@@ et@@ é of the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and awarded the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every day and nobody can look away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer league , no , we must use our brilli@@ ance to help our influence and abilities to help the many refugees that have already been so incredibly suffered , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent characters of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the European Quali@@ fication play against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ni@@ ers@@ bach , the support of refugees responsible for refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license partners have started in their own projects would be great .
this is the same thing that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the association will jointly contribute to the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach told . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly been lost to several reports by a fall in the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on stairs in the house of his brother in the US , he fell to midnight on a water glass that he had borne in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bloo@@ ded , f@@ ainted , was f@@ ainted , then he turns out to the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
in early October we meet front of the Supervisory Board at Wal@@ dorf , &quot; Pl@@ att@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old managers were with the meeting and &quot; fully unemployed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the Southern German newspaper &quot; ( Thursday Edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany again in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP since I &apos;m full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t often comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; The Manager of &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up once you are gone . &quot;

So@@ ccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes were drawn to a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group game of the Europe League .
the National Player will also be missing for the ranking of the soccer league of the soccer league in Du@@ eling with the P@@ FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 o &apos;clock / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t resort to him . &quot; Thomas Tu@@ chel said on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ B @-@ coach would be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the high burden of his pros , Tus@@ chel will not only change its ancest@@ ral eleven on the R@@ EU@@ s position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place the place of stam@@ b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level . &quot; the soccer team gave the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the turn@@ tables in the future is used in all Europe league games , but Tu@@ chel brought him openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will also deny the second game with a high probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the search statement of Mit@@ er R@@ EU@@ s said that the final goal for the Bv@@ B will be the objective of Julian W@@ eig@@ l , saying , &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to attack the title . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett agreed a strategy document from the house of traffic Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , provides investments in the expanding digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at Frankfurt at the edge of the Motor Show at a &quot; new mobile era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automated and net@@ worked driving will raise the traffic safety and provide less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , which will also come together with representatives from the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport director of the Ministry of Transport is empha@@ sized the importance of the mobile broad@@ band extension and a fast @-@ level change on digital radio listening .
a test track is currently being tested on Highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order that the driver does not receive additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government will need to verify the legal framework &quot; and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , Germany wants to ensure that the maximum allowed top speed is increased by 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also aims to introduce a change to the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated driving takes over the car the lead , the driver will be more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet the vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected far away in 2020 . &quot;
the authors in the field of driver assistance systems and high @-@ automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one on Wednesday at the FOR@@ SA institute &apos;s survey commissioned by the German institute , that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars are expected to prevail in the next ten years , 31 percent do not believe that 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed until 2025 with autonomous cars in the US 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on an independent vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a collection of the B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire trip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the fre@@ eway , in flowing traffic there could be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , every fourth one would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll says team and double starts at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dus@@ seldorf is aim@@ ing at the current status with the title batt@@ ling from September 25 to October 4 only in singles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision is scheduled to fall later on 22 . September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get Timo for the title , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM career in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China at this time .
the 34 year old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer so a clear favorite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the se@@ ar list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , was remembered at the European Central Bank in 2013 too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo Scheider was missing and we became a European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves &quot; explained the world ranking @-@ lists .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a large fashion show and a wat@@ cht@@ a Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) announced his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequ@@ ins which can be terri@@ bly cho@@ red thanks to video projec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and so that he was hiding men in the skirts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I &apos;m the feeling of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) that has changed from the 18th of September to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung places a show about his person has changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had actually been on the contrary , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it sounded like a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come into the museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into the very far @-@ sigh@@ ted work of the man , who has written the fashion story , without ever completing an apprentic@@ eship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it &apos;s an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall work that was used for much effort : in order to indul@@ ge the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist was engaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 tonnes of materials took the makers according to the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , after Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before the October Festival was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are noisy as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old ted@@ dy is also to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ious fashion trials of the designer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , and said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
the design of fashion he later taught himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stole fashion magazines , and saw the design of other designers at how Gaul@@ tier was told in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later I bought some of them .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything but could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ er tip as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in great amount for customers who , for example , processed for ceilings and curtains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this alone does not work anymore and explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ bili@@ cal P@@ lau@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead fashion is again important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ er tip , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt explains some examples : top in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the so @-@ called vintage fashion which re@@ jects the past styles of sur@@ pl@@ ets .
who does not use any niche in the textile branch in Germany is not on the market anymore .
they already make half of all orders for us .
Mo@@ mm@@ ets P@@ lau@@ en is together with nine other companies member in the P@@ lau@@ er tip and sti@@ cker .
only they can carry the protected label .
about 80 percent of its sales were taken away in the last 15 years .
private specialised shops and the wholesale prices are of course no longer .
our products barely reach our customers on this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass food is much cheaper in Asian countries , and almost exclusively sold through chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the weaker export of export is currently being exported to Russia and USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so sufficient reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association seeks to score topics such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we produce a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecological and socially sustainable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
a graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the University of Schnee@@ berger from Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and spi@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to opp@@ ose the competition from Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , existing design often varies just slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some years ago the mus@@ cul@@ tured textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly discovered the historic snow top .
the machine ch@@ okes small ch@@ icks in some places .
the lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ men in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ck had been inspired : &quot; I couldn &apos;t start to start with traditional P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot;
now it uses the wire top tip for their jewelry .
the pattern in one elaborate process shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ er tip - young and old . &quot; says Re@@ uter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors settled in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and those who want to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador for the P@@ lau@@ er tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legend shall one not touch , but Disney adds up to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; it is not a further movie , but about a kind of continuation who plays the magical baby girl for 20 years after the first movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family of B@@ anks in times of World economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is un@@ clear .
but the director already stands : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI urged to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open broad@@ ly to the out@@ ward , in order to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ und said on Tuesday , was commissioned to reform the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should anticip@@ ate foreign investment and expertise and improve strategies for business founders , &quot; said in a speech at the 16th Session of the central leadership group for deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new development and reforms will accelerate new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guide group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population mil@@ king system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity is created which identi@@ fies the sectors and companies that are not into question for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance , as it indicates the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a right state of government guarantees the market an open market , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government is also stimulated to the companies in the transmitted powers , and ensure that companies decide how to lead their transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement , too , said that China has to allow border regions to promote new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are open to private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change their policy towards foreign investments and will protect the lawful interests of foreign finance companies and deliver better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and the application process will be reli@@ eved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right to guarantee lawyers to practice their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader , like Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , took part in a declaration published after the meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU wants to double the mercury @-@ limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double its limits for mercury into large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , thus making a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who &apos;s a corresponding research paper is cri@@ tici@@ zing the plans : &quot; risks and side effects are passed on with full impact of pregnant women and young children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ ens@@ dt , the limit values for large fish at the end of the food chain should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury due to the still valid limit values of approximately 50 per cent of the fin@@ s are not sold .
by dou@@ bling the limit values by then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be for sale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in exchange for this entic@@ ement , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the mar@@ ginal values with other fish from currently 0.5 million to 0,1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , however , called this &quot; trick &quot; as small peac@@ em@@ akers , such as car@@ p usually so low , that they already hold the planned maximum value already today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the lowering of the sin@@ king is therefore &quot; a per@@ sion of distra@@ ctions , which helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is an extremely toxic heavy metal that has heavily poll@@ uted over the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore warns , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , small quantities are especially likely to cause damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on its homepage , the Federal Ministry of Environmental declares that &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population would not be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury can be used primarily through coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environmental Affairs , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock signed more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the German Federal Ministry issued in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube are &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; the mirror &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already occurred to the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
