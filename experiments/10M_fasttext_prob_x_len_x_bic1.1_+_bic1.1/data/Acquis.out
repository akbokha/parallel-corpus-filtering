it is recommended to add the ship@@ ments to the infusion @-@ required equipment as well as the solvents for dry preparations .
human full blood is that a healthy people escap@@ ing and mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans mixed blood .
C ) the non @-@ free are transfer@@ able by blood trans@@ f@@ usi@@ onic diseases , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is g@@ ging through an enclosed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ent solution was introduced before steril@@ ization .

the liquid content of the concentration consists of either of the remaining plasma or from a suitable water@@ course artificial wat@@ ering solution based on the plasma distance .
the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) is indicated on the label .
all conditions required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the import must be made under use of steril@@ ization , closed system and exclusively by printing .
if an artificial wat@@ ering solution has been added , it is also specified on the label their volume and composition .
the human drying plasma is obtained through drying of the liquid , which reduces the cent@@ rifug@@ ing or se@@ di@@ ments above .

a cage to blood group determination must react to all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ ol@@ ated to the antibody or another on the label .
if a cage in the recommended way is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) h@@ olog@@ oly@@ tic characteristics ;
the tit@@ er is measured by a re @-@ dil@@ ution of the prec@@ in@@ ct that has been doubled in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the recur@@ ring value of the number of strongest power , in which a reaction occurs ; the dil@@ ution is calculated solely in volume of blood cells in the whole volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are to be used on object dreams , the activity is necessary for a ag@@ glut@@ y on a object carrier .
the World Health Organisation for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ D reag@@ ents , as well as the entire anti @-@ D reag@@ ent to measure international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity are designated for time standards .

( 1 ) The effectiveness of the reag@@ ents to the blood @-@ determination of most speci@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational , which is observed in a series of dil@@ ution in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the tit@@ er gives the dil@@ ution of the Re@@ agent in the last mixture inside a series , in which a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ y occurs .
the effectiveness of the reag@@ ents to the blood group determination are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and non @-@ core anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in the basis of the tit@@ ration of unknown prec@@ in@@ ct in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

if a cage is stored in the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary characteristics should be at least one year long .
at most , the exp@@ iry dates of a recur@@ rent form , according to the label , is at most a year after the last satisfactory host test .
based on the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for drying reag@@ ents , after the results of the holding function , it is directed by state authorities of regulatory authorities .
drying reag@@ ents are kept in a atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum container , in which they have dried and so closed , that no humidity can enter .

reag@@ ents to measure the blood @-@ determination are in such ways and in such quantities that this in a container lies not only for performing tests with the unknown blood cells , but also for performing tests with positive and negative control ble@@ eding .
the amount must be so large in a container that may be used to implement the efficacy and tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer of manufacturers have written written records through all production levels and controls of reag@@ ents .
adequate samples of all issued reag@@ ents are so long kept from the laboratory and may be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents of the reag@@ ents of the reag@@ ents can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) of origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to increase effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the Re@@ acts .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided in three groups according to their effective part .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin are exclusively contained in human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents do not contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black @-@ white label can be attached to the English and French language , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

the following requirements to the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to the determination of the R@@ h group may possibly change if International standard prepar@@ es are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group vaccine ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from blood of one or several people who are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain an@@ tigen D , but do not contain human blood cells that do not contain an@@ tigen .

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain an@@ tigen D , the serum should react to blood cells that do not respond to do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object dreams according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50 percent floo@@ ding of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in approximately 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .

in a given serum , both antibodies have to be effective under the specified response conditions at the same time .
it is a serum for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , thus the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time in all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ is@@ ite antibodies .
