A@@ bil@@ isi is used for treatment of moderate to severe episodes and prevention of poor episodes for patients who have been addressed in the past to the medicine .
the injection solution is applied for fast control of distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles when the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to one or the processed tablet for patients , where swal@@ low up tablets difficulties .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bil@@ isi should be adjusted automatically .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells due to &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of the nerve cells each other .
Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole goes primarily as &quot; partial Ag@@ ility &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ z@@ j@@ yl@@ benzene as 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole wearing the activity of the brain to norm@@ alize psych@@ otic or man@@ ian symptoms and their re@@ occur .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ led , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar ill@@ nesses that had been compared to placebo over a period of two hours .
in a further study , A@@ bil@@ i@@ xed more than twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study carried out the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ ical and placebo to occur in 160 patients in which the man@@ ian symptoms had already been stabil@@ ized at A@@ bil@@ isi .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ ical In@@ jection solution was performed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which had an increased distur@@ b@@ ance , which was compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also led trials to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablet and the solution for inclusion ( up ) .
in both studies involving the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bil@@ led in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly more severe reductions of symptoms who received a placebo .
in four of five short @-@ time studies the symptoms were more effective than placebo in four of five short @-@ time studies .
in addition , A@@ bil@@ led prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo received the re @-@ perform episodes on previously treated patients and when it was additionally given to an existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ ical inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo perceived the symptoms of un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ ical ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) , head@@ ache ( de@@ fle@@ ction ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea blood ( increased spoke @-@ production ) , s@@ ali@@ ation ( increased spoke @-@ production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , o@@ det@@ o@@ deficiency , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep problems ) and attack@@ ing .
at the end , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of ag@@ it@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and the treatment of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had mostly lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ z@@ ak@@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene , compared to the risks involved .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles in patients with bi@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ian episodes is bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable for the risk of risk .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an approval for placing an event in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is intended for the treatment of constant episodes of bi@@ polar episodes of bi@@ polar den@@ ia - and for the prevention of a new man@@ ian episode of patients , which had predominantly man@@ sions and other episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has been detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , independent of the meals as a mono@@ therap@@ ist or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with regard to the bigger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ ine dose should be considered , if clinical factors are just@@ ify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor can be removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icides are one of psychological disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of ep@@ idemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased su@@ icides in patients with Ari@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ectious diseases ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , terms which are used for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ red and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ o@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials which ran a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ ane @-@ ro@@ z@@ ole .
if one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be drawn into consideration the dose may be reduced or to break the treatment .
when one patient developed signs and symptoms , that indicate a m@@ ns or without an additional fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
as a result , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole should be used in patients with cl@@ amp@@ ires in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states that are used in connection with c@@ amp@@ ires in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole in patients treated with psych@@ osis treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole was an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there were however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted disin@@ teg@@ ration events with Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases is extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ ant@@ in@@ ous com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ post@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics where weight gain is observed , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the prim@@ itive effect of Ari@@ ane @-@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene , the central nervous system is warned when Ari@@ pi@@ yl@@ benzene in combination with alcohol or other centrally positioned drugs can be taken as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ z@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant to clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect another high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made with similar dose reductions .
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the combined application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole results in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
if you consider the common application of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in effect , the potential benefit should not exceed the potential haz@@ ards for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should be made with similar dose reductions .
according to the use of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ages before the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
di@@ lem@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated using a constant increase of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ol@@ itic concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole showed no significant effect on Met@@ abol@@ ism of the substr@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Methodi@@ us morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to al@@ ert their doctor if pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data base to ensure safety in human beings and in the reproduction studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential profit just@@ i@@ fies the potential haz@@ ard for the red@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica the patients should be warned of driving dangerous machines , including power vehicles to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole has no negative effect on it .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ c@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in placebo was placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients who were treated with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ische periods at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % amounted to patients under Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase , over 26 weeks for a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medical significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ k@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ z@@ ro@@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene , compared to 2.0 % of treated patients treated with placebo .
in relation to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ aries and var@@ ic@@ fan@@ less , un@@ desirable un@@ desirable events and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or un@@ inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ si@@ ations with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and ob@@ sc@@ ath@@ es .
there are no information about the effectiveness of a do@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole . however , it is un@@ likely that Hä@@ me@@ aly@@ sis has an over@@ dosage of benefits since Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole has a high plasma integration .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption through the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors are convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ ane @-@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene in vitro demonstrated a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors as well as an aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ata , and to the receptor @-@ H1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed the decre@@ es reduction of the bin@@ aries of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor @-@ Lig@@ anden , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and Put@@ ames .
in three placebo @-@ controlled shor@@ tw@@ ave studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of patients in response was observed in both groups ( Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from the scales that were defined as secondary data potential , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ g@@ inal Dep@@ - scale , showed significantly more stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ al pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study carried out in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks in reducing symptoms .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ y@@ tic study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness against placebo .
in two placebo and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole showed an exc@@ essive effectiveness in week 3 and an maintenance effect that was comparable to the group of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic R@@ ains of the Man@@ ie demonstrated like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , which also reflected on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ s @-@ mono@@ therap@@ ist with therapeutic serum , which partially over 2 weeks suffered a superior effectiveness in reducing human symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ist with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks prior to Rand@@ om@@ isation during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole showed superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , primarily in the prevention of a return in the Man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies the enzy@@ mes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ the@@ aters , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ ation is described by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 catal@@ y@@ zed .
the mean elim@@ ination of the mean elim@@ ination process is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole for extensive Met@@ abol@@ ians about CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for almost 146 hours with &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ isation via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ ane @-@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic investigation of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or interaction of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ p@@ yl@@ benzene and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole were similar in patients with severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of patients with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to pull s@@ isal at their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , reproduction technology , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and can@@ o@@ gens potential , pre@@ clinical data were no particular d@@ angers to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so it only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects of the dos@@ sier ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ ine pigment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats according to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10@@ mg / kg / day ) in the recommended maximum dose of female Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ asis was determined as a result of the loss of Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ benzene in the G@@ alle of apes from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ times the average ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended dose of clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations in human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , which were determined in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed with dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended operating maximum dose .

hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases is extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ ant@@ in@@ ous com@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
di@@ lem@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ( or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated using a constant increase of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ol@@ itic concentrations .
man@@ ische periods at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption through the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors are convey@@ ed .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study carried out in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ y@@ tic study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness against placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ evaluation study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of 30 mg of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole was compared with healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a chol@@ eli@@ asis was determined as a result of the loss of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate in the G@@ alle of apes from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ fold of the average ste@@ ady dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed with dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended operating maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to rapid control of ag@@ it@@ ability and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles in patients with bi@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ian episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not attached .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the per@@ ate regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on the individual clinical status taking into consideration the treatment or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablet or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inclusion .
there are no research for the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles that caused different than sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and man@@ ian episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition , a par@@ ent@@ ric therapy with Ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole injection solution should be considered necessary , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme degra@@ dation or blood pressure . ( see section 4.5 ) .
research and efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical po@@ is@@ oning ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ectious diseases ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , terms which are used for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ red and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
sk@@ et@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ ane @-@ ro@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ way , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ post@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , in which weight gain is observed or an un@@ healthy life and could lead to serious complications .
however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ination was greater compared with the sole gift of Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole , in a study , in the healthy volunteers of Ari@@ z@@ ro@@ z@@ ole ( 15@@ mg dose ) and received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) at the same time .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ z@@ ro@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant to clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations arise from Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , probably should have similar effects and therefore should be made with similar dose reductions .
according to the use of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ages before the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received in tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of Sed@@ om@@ ination was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ z@@ ro@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were considered as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were reported in clinical trials with oral mal@@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene as possible medical @-@ relevant adverse events ( * ) . ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in placebo was placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase , over 26 weeks for a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medical significant differences .
increase in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ k@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ z@@ ro@@ eth@@ yl@@ benzene , compared to 2.0 % of treated patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles was statistically significant in Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole injection solution with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ it@@ ability / behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ it@@ cip@@ ation and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles , the Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant greater improvement in the sympt@@ om and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average review of the starting value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement Compon@@ ent score at primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ it@@ ability , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population was observed , but statistical significance was observed in response to reduced patient numbers .
in three placebo @-@ controlled shor@@ tw@@ ave studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of patients in response was observed in both groups ( Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole 77 % ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary potential , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ ence rates , showed significantly more stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study carried out in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients had significantly fewer patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , which also reflected on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ s @-@ mono@@ therap@@ ist with therapeutic serum , which partially over 2 weeks suffered a superior effectiveness in reducing human symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ist with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ian patients who had reached a remission in radiation during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ z@@ j@@ ole showed superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , primarily in the prevention of a return in the Man@@ ie .
in the first 2 hours of in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection , 90 % larger the AU@@ C is based on the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time is up to reaching the maximum plasma time of 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys well toler@@ ated and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment with a systematic exposure of 30 mg of in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for the reproduction C@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no security concerns about mat@@ er@@ nal exposure published in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human exposure of 30@@ mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ ad@@ j@@ ole ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , reproduction , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and can@@ o@@ gens potential , pre@@ clinical data were no particular d@@ angers to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they only limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects of the dos@@ sier ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ ine pigment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state @-@ state exposure ) of female Ste@@ ady state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ asis was determined as a result of the loss of Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ benzene in the G@@ alle of apes from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended dose of clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed with dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical peak dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study by the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( as a little gift or as mono@@ therap@@ ist ) was compared with the medication of a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el based on a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients with conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el herbal medic@@ inal products .
however , only people were treated that were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer in relation to the efficacy of the disease as much as deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
however , in those cases , the previously other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer resulted in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el herbal medicine .
it may also not be used in patients who maintain low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ari@@ ous in the blood before the beginning of the treatment .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was based on patients who use the first treatment as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el herbal medic@@ inal and that it must not be given as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing other medicines not to reduce adverse events .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Personal Data of Bi@@ os@@ c@@ ience Limited for placing the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in people where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic numbers &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y Grade 3 , treatment is capable of breaking down to a degree 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments for patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with ir@@ reversible kidney function , and there is currently no adequate data to the recommendation of dose adjustments for patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for in@@ solvency and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ oli@@ kel@@ etal formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have a much pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed immediately and a sy@@ mptom@@ atic treatment is applied , and the patient must not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renew the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be re@@ directed to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ k number has again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
as a uni@@ qu@@ ely shaped bi@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents were not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or contra@@ di@@ cted heart or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual ant@@ emet@@ ika and constant funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or pregnant women , who do not use an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ usually lon@@ ely .
women in b@@ ump@@ ed age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable processing method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be mixed , during and up to six months after the treatment no child dies .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm count because of the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of ir@@ reversible non @-@ fertil@@ ity .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can effect on the transport and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was measured quickly and dos@@ si@@ bly ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed in Table 1 , these effects were listed in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mono@@ therap@@ ist at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

o@@ emul@@ o@@ fluid 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity actions is calculated based on a defin@@ itive decline in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no illegal connection with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ um @-@ active ingredient that promotes the com@@ po@@ unding of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ let inde@@ xes and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to its de@@ oly@@ sis .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the micro@@ rotating network , which is essential for vit@@ ational inter@@ activity and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in trans@@ forms of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was funded by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ si@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ cal transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ous transfers is performed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( hen@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ log@@ ged studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received every 3 weeks a mono@@ therap@@ ist in patients with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour infusion with pre@@ ference for prevention of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ acted General condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
in other cases , 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for the general response rate and time for progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received the first @-@ line treatment are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by a degree of patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y Grade 3 in the therapy during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y for dro@@ pping on Bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the general P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the exposure exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After an intraven@@ ous cell of Abra@@ x@@ ane an patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took part in a single @-@ phase way .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ it@@ ari@@ al distribution and / or female connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced sound tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 A solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher than the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was of Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ el ) and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ el ) and 6@@ α @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute In@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the incidence of cum@@ ulative assets accounted for 4 % of the total daily dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ abol@@ ite 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ann@@ ance .

it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values that might occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood flow is not possible prior to the procedure , and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected .
treatment with f@@ ails must be derived under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who wish to make an own blood pressure , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected in a vase .
injection can also be made by the patient or legal assistance , if they have given an appropriate instruction .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure / or in patients who received chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter with adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before treatment in order to ensure that no iron defic@@ ien@@ cies should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may cause an@@ a@@ emia due to a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etic deficiency , or that the body is not sufficient on the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .

Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections in a v@@ ein in the framework of a main study of 479 patients who had caused an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene for eight weeks before they had either received acc@@ urs@@ ed or continue to have received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the processing period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also explained the results of a study , in which the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who had caused an@@ emia due to kidney problems caused the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were treated to Ab@@ se@@ amed have received the same degree as for those who continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continue to have received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of du@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain problems ) like sudden , mig@@ rat@@ ory tri@@ p@@ ains and confusion .
fl@@ amed may not be applied in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ fl@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that these are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for f@@ light@@ less according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence , the medicine has been a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients who should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ omal@@ ous symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ tions can be different depending on age , gender and total illness . therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance can be required by the doctor .
a increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in order to increase by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be monitored via or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability should be tried by a corresponding dose management , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , if the durable hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored and monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ emia and an@@ omal@@ ous symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl , or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients who form the initial an@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl , or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .

an@@ omal@@ ous symptoms and - follow @-@ up risks can be different depending on age , gender and total illness . therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance can be required by the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability should be tried by a corresponding dose management , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should also be monitored in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of infection symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the ret@@ ik@@ o@@ zy@@ ten@@ se increases by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl against the output value , the dose of 150 i.e. / kg three times a week or 450 i.e. / kg should be retained once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the retin@@ opath@@ ological level has increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose should be increased to 300 i.e. / kg three times a week .
for further 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.e. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in order to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , the dose of 300 i.e. / kg should be retained three times a week .
however , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the ret@@ ik@@ o@@ zy@@ ten@@ se by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , a response to the ep@@ ic @-@ al@@ fa therapy is un@@ likely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ car@@ ing of ≥ 4 blood war@@ ri@@ ors should be required , fl@@ aming fl@@ amed increases in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg of body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron subst@@ itution should begin as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood flow program - started to stand large iron reserves before the start of the se@@ fl@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg of ep@@ och in al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery procedure and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle the bone ) both in women after previous years and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high depression risk ( bone cr@@ ates ) , including in patients who suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic r@@ ump of cr@@ ust as during H@@ inf@@ in ; • Cro@@ ce of the bone , a disease which changed the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ a@@ Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with gu@@ ards should be taken before the first infusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of perio@@ don@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms of symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ ps similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for therap@@ ist Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ ometric is used for evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and it was examined the number of sp@@ ine and hat@@ s over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , who had suffered a hat@@ s of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in two studies , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds the bone body ) in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of cycl@@ or@@ tions was reduced in people under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ s ) over a period of three years compared to the placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ s ) with those under placebo the risk of boun@@ cing fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hat@@ s , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a faction ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are often associated with repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients , possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the infusion of oste@@ och@@ on@@ dro@@ as ( death of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a introduces re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors who use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients to be explained in which the effects of medication should be explained and pointing to the doctor .
in April 2005 the European Commission granted the European Commission to the European Union to grant approval from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in males with increased risk for fra@@ c@@ tures , including in patients with a recently discontinued low @-@ trau@@ matic tip .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic reduction , the administration is recommended by the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operative supply of the por@@ ft@@ ist structure ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ get .
after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long remission was observed in patients receiving treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , i.e. twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently discontinued low @-@ trau@@ matic pris@@ ion@@ ic , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ic or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced shortly after the application of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney problems ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min as@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experiences for this group of patients are present .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended to use children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data for in@@ fertil@@ ity and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because the patient &apos;s population has only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ cr@@ emia should be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a prior to the beginning of the therapy with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ag@@ ic to the bone structure , a temporary , mit@@ ig@@ atic hypo@@ allergi@@ es can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , i.e. twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ ids , bad mouth hygiene ) should be used before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dent@@ ist with adequate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental surgery , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates are reduced the risk for oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the area of jaw .
clinical evaluation by the treatments doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced shortly after applying Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe adverse events reported by Vor@@ hop@@ el@@ a was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ly Quest@@ ionn@@ aire &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was the total th@@ reading of occurr@@ ences between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted pharmaceutical effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney problems Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ag@@ ic was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed as a decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. , increasing the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases of acute kidney failure .
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared with 0,8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory cells the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values reported below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fragments after a stroke , and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fragments after a recently discontinued stroke , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion point , such as ro@@ cking , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ och@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the area of money , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ och@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ rons were treated .
many of these patients had the signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of the reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients according to Zah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other dental .
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients entered oste@@ on@@ ek@@ dro@@ id in the area of a p@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with a placebo group treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant mort@@ g@@ emia may be achieved by gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at a compensation .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was recorded in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a medium @-@ heavy flu@@ idi@@ zed chain structure or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the chain ho@@ ist ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing s@@ wir@@ ling action .
effects on morph@@ ometric de@@ fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients aged 75 years and older were compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) compared to placebo patients .
effects on boun@@ cing fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a demonstrated a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of dying down by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rates , hi@@ ps and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 enh@@ ancing the bone density of the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , of the total th@@ igh by 6.0 % , of the archipelago is about 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In case of 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of Knochen@@ bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic sponge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo a increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the receipt of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone correc@@ t@@ mark@@ er The bones specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d type ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in peri@@ odic intervals from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value by 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not as measured , but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and chain ho@@ und to all times .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment by a 5.4 % increase in the overall th@@ igh and 4.3 % on the ridges .
clinical efficacy in males In the HOR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study have been random@@ ized 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show reductions of clinical c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical c@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males in comparison to 8,7 % in placebo .
in another study included in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage change from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at to the percentage of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D within 24 months , compared with the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ al P@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed disease infection according to the bone tumor ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ rons in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , after 6 months , a similar decline in the pain strength and pain imp@@ em@@ ulation was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified by the end of the 6 @-@ month main study as a response to therapy , were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of treated patients who were treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , then performed during a mean duration of the follow @-@ up of 18 months after application .
one time and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic data that proved to be dos@@ sier .
afterwards , the plasma tor@@ ped@@ o increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
R@@ ash@@ es bi@@ phas@@ ic dis@@ appearance from the large circulation system with half @-@ del@@ ays t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a terminal eli@@ alization of a total of ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β is , with the above mentioned above 1 ½ -@@ values ) , presumably the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the de@@ position of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose in urine , whereas the rest mainly is tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decline of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ rons ster@@ ity concentration by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a di@@ min@@ ated Clear@@ ance caused by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme , is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , non @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ aring of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was included in the average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting up to 35 ml / min do not require any dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
because severe kidney problems ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) are only valid for this population , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and up to 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the basis of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
sub@@ chron@@ ous and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was determined by doses of 0.6 mg / kg used as a 15 minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , in a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that correspond to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , referred to the AU@@ C , con@@ forms to the AU@@ C , con@@ forms ) .
in long term studies with repeated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tra@@ cker , and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection station .
the most common inc@@ eption in studies with repeated application was a pro@@ lifer@@ ative primary sponsor@@ ship of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a evidence that reflects the pharmac@@ ological effects of substance , anti@@ res@@ or@@ atory effect of substance .
at rats there was a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as an external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such as the sk@@ el@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits , no @-@ heter@@ ogen@@ eous effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ er@@ nal tox@@ icity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of the low serum @-@ calcium mirror .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the preparation time and the conditions in front of the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Public@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , explained in which the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the carried out in order to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be applied in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medicine ) can be applied together . • It can be used together with another diabet@@ ic medicine .
in addition , met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) can be applied in patients with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ate resin or insulin , the existing dose of Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ os@@ s or insulin is capable of reducing the insulin treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar level ) ; this dose should be reduced to the insulin delivery dose or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level falls better , so that type 2 diabetes is better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ a was investigated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ate resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is set .
it led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows to close the blood sugar values by the use of the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the comple@@ xes , the effect of an additional gift of acet@@ ate to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ate resin in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the extra gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had studied at 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in the patients receiving additionally placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision @-@ problems , infections of the upper respir@@ atory ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients either in patients who are unable to react to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( high ket@@ ones - acidity level - blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as part of a mono@@ therap@@ ist ( for the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for placing on cars from Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until wh@@ it@@ ish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or sy@@ mptom@@ atic heart disease ) , a de@@ compens@@ ated cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose stages .
patients should follow signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , gain weight gain or eye @-@ de@@ pot , especially those with reduced bar@@ di@@ aler reserves .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and oil ways when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports about cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality .
in patients with elevated output liver data values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver data values are again as soon as possible .
if a patient is developed which refer to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , exhau@@ st@@ ive problems , ti@@ red@@ ness , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver data values .
the decision if the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the pre@@ st@@ ance of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ sh@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir in fat deposits and in some cases it is connected with a fluid .
as a result of a hem@@ or@@ b@@ az@@ one , as a result of the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a minimum reduction of medium hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lower extent in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the enhanced insulin @-@ sensitivity was observed in patients who received Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ate @-@ insulin @-@ insulin @-@ dependent insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
after a market launch the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported via an appearance or deteri@@ oration of diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ o@@ de@@ ms , but it should be aware of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a while patients report on interference of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological declaration should be considered .
in a summary of messages of un@@ desired events with regard to bone out@@ comes , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the calculated structure of the error was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years , with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures for women , treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events occurred fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) combined with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative clinical study .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if one patient wishes to be pregnancy or who is entering the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical characteristics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ olic and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral counter@@ act , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with the pul@@ mon@@ ary ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is primarily due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one who reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of breast cancer , thus reducing the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the f@@ öt@@ al growth .
extremely common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( calculated from present information ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the den@@ oting index of the lens , as well as with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the three times the upper limit of the standard area were equally commonly referred to as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ li@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an out@@ come study of patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease it was the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or
since its launch , rare has been reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency .
a summary of messages of un@@ desired events with regard to bone mar@@ es from randomised controlled trials were randomised , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study period of 3,5 years , fra@@ c@@ tures appeared on 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in people treated with a comparative clinical study .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which results in the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton muscles .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and the peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ mos util@@ izes in the case of insulin resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mono@@ therap@@ ist was carried out more than two years to examine the time until the therap@@ ist of therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be investigated by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients suffering from Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate in spite of three months , was randomised to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to those who received insulin @-@ insulin . a reduction of insulin inj@@ ections in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mono@@ therap@@ y@@ on ( mono@@ therap@@ ists with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , based on type 2 diabetes in 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statistically significant increase of the LD@@ L cholesterol was detected , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on didn &apos;t just lower the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved , also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ kings increased tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de levels , which also showed a effect on tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups were random@@ ly allocated to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the concentration of the concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was able to produce a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use insulin effective .
the study measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els , pointing out that blood sugar levels were significantly reduced like with another human effect .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients with an allergic reaction ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may possibly be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to grant approval for placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ insulin @-@ products normally are used once or twice daily when a rapid initi@@ ate effect would have desired effect together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be placed under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
patients , whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensi@@ vely insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia should have changed measures and should therefore be advised .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin @-@ type ( insulin @-@ phase ) , insulin ( insulin @-@ dependent ) and / or manufacturing method ( caused by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA ) and / or manufacturing method ( caused by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA ) can result in a change of dosage .
if the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required to enable a dose adaptation to the patient , this may be necessary during the first dose or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions were reported after a change from animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced than in their previous insulin .
before vo@@ y@@ ages that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to get the advice of his physician , as such trips can be taken and taken up to other times and must be taken with other times .
therefore , the doctor must therefore consider potential inter@@ actions in the therapy and always subject his patients to others after others .

in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may possibly be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for placing on transportation of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the European Union .
when two types of insulin is mixed , first the amount of insulin has to be put into insulin , then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin is required .
3 If a dose adap@@ tion to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d is required for the patient , this may be necessary during the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before vo@@ y@@ ages that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to get the advice of his physician , as such trips can be taken and taken up to other times and must be taken with other times .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with the signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sum no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , which can result in joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary weight is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months may still occur forever ; it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking further medicines for prevention of gyp@@ sies .
the drug is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study included in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( one other drugs for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems was only 100 mg per day .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose arm@@ or acid @-@ level blood was among the last three measurements among 6 mg / d@@ L .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who studied Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg / dl twice daily in the last three measurements .
in comparison to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart failure may possibly affect an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
at the end , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary acid in blood but also a higher risk of adverse reactions in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in cases that have already led to urine det@@ ag@@ ings ( including one from the n@@ ul@@ ars known or currently available g@@ cht@@ k@@ not@@ ation and / or a tox@@ icated arthritis ) .
if the serum @-@ sour mirror is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 times daily .
in patients with severe kidney problems , the efficacy and safety of safety have not been completely investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experience in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ ted since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ tation , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease patients with anti @-@ mixer heart disease or de@@ compres@@ sive heart failure is not recommended to treat er@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .
as in other hard @-@ acid medication , it may occur during treatment at an acute sp@@ ens@@ ity , because of reducing the serum levels , ur@@ inary damage can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .
B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine ( rare cases ) could rise to a re@@ location in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease during phase 3 clinical trials were observed with slight differentiation of the liver function in treated with February ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver functional prior to the beginning of the February ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line Z@@ was not conducted no interaction studies on Feb@@ u@@ cin@@ ate , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to a rise in the oph@@ yll content ( a shirt of the Met@@ abol@@ ism of The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
at subjects , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ r@@ ash and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the Feb@@ u@@ ated exposition ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not related to a clinical significant increase of adverse events .

in a study included 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase of the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ stra@@ t , which indicates a possible weak binding effect of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the con@@ gest@@ ion of a ant@@ acids that contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and causes a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies occur not to side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the pregnancy or health of fo@@ et@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies allow not to direct or indirect impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful with the tax of a vehicle , serving machines or during exercise of dangerous activities , until they can reas@@ on@@ ably be reas@@ on@@ ably ensured that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the test with cardiovascular group was observed in the overall fossil study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no cau@@ tionary correlation was found to be found with February .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ity @-@ erotic disease and / or a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that occurred in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg , Feb@@ u@@ ate and the ( test validation ) were reported in connection with the medicine and reported in all February 5 @-@ month treatment groups are listed below .

7 Open long@@ time extension studies In open long @-@ term renewal studies , 906 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Feb@@ u@@ lin@@ ux@@ e@@ 80 mg / 120 mg .
during the long @-@ term renewal studies , treatment @-@ related events were similar to those reported in phase 3 trials ( see table 1 ) .
the following positions were reported in all February @-@ related treatment groups more than once and compet@@ ed in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and subjects study , as described below ) associated with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and tox@@ ic@@ ation .
the primary efficacy level was in every study of the patients who were given certain serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cancer worth of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
in terms of reducing the serum levels , the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditional cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the Inter@@ act study showed a statistically significant impair@@ ment in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the decrease in serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cancer values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney restriction ( AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney restriction ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy level was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clinical significant differences in regards to the percentage of serum levels in patients , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl A@@ round 40 % of patients ( ap@@ eline ) had an serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected from two years collected data from the open extension study of the Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients required a reduction in the incidence of poison ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required for a reduction in response ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sum size , which included 54 % of the patients to a complete dis@@ appearance of gyp@@ sum lines up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ IF@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with we@@ as@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is proportional to use and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise of AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ sh@@ ady increase .
after intake of simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2,8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage decrease of serum concentration was observed , unless this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ s@@ s / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 mg after intake doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma integration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is around 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary engagement of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration area reaching doses of 80 and 120 mg .

since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical trial involving 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation were presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was gra@@ ded after a treatment duration of one year , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a revival of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were performed with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and examined , as Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body using advanced gra@@ f / test gra@@ ft .

in patients with any over@@ sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other constitu@@ ents may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the simultaneously recorded medication must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with the immune response therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should be given to this medicine or make changes in an immun@@ al intensive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this may lead to gra@@ ft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or super@@ vis@@ it@@ ants .
patients should always be the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; adjustment of formulation and the regime should be carried out under the tight control of a physician &apos;s tran@@ spl@@ ant control ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of the change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of waste and tolerance in individual cases and blood @-@ level control ( see below &quot; recommendations
after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ bot should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the systematic exposure was measured as an valley level , with both joints and both eyes and tran@@ spl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ bot are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant to ensure appropriate substance of exposure in direct tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the state of the patients in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral treatment of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment is intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the infusion of infusion solution ) with a dose of approx .
period of use for suppression of the transplan@@ tation must be canc@@ eled ; consequ@@ ent can therefore be given a maximum duration of oral therapy .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation by proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for transplan@@ tation , the oral pro@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be required later , as pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of the patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of corneal epi@@ thel@@ ial therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must take a gra@@ ft capsule of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f , thus the conversion in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to take effect on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant after a change@@ over from other immune soup once daily must begin the treatment with the recommended initi@@ als recommended for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ ts , although there are no clinical experience with cancer , pan@@ cre@@ as and tran@@ spl@@ ant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , in pan@@ cre@@ mat@@ ory transplan@@ tation in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood tal@@ es in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the ren@@ al function does not exercise impact on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atic mirror , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ to to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the change@@ over of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine based on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in thorough@@ bred the dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of im@@ pur@@ ging and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the aid of whole blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ bot controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ bot during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood Tal@@ bot from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after the change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes to immune soup treatment or for the benefit of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medic@@ inal product with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments may need multiple days if the Ste@@ ady State has oc@@ cured .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transplan@@ tations , in the range from 5 to 20 ng / ml and cor@@ sel@@ ed patients with 10 to 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations were taken in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft reactions or other adverse events which can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always be the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; adjustment of formulation and the regime should be carried out under the tight control of a physician &apos;s tran@@ spl@@ ant control ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions known to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ si@@ va as therapy , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of adv@@ ancement .
for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation in adult heart transplan@@ tation and gra@@ fts , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of adv@@ ancement .
due to possible inter@@ actions which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the dosage of herbal medic@@ ations contained ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) , or other plant remedy during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in blood has been offered because the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels could be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations .
in rare cases a cardi@@ ology hyper@@ t@@ rophy was observed in rare cases , which therefore can be observed at Adv@@ agra@@ f at Pro@@ gra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical problems are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ id , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid over@@ loading , and oil .
like with other immune soup , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
when patients who use Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for P@@ res such as head@@ ache , changing consciousness , forces and vision disorders , should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g ) .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is advis@@ able to alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - Blood mirror with the benefit of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain exc@@ essive concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies showed that the increase of blood levels was mainly due to the enhanced bi@@ over@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal confusion .

since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us perme@@ ates the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contra@@ diction , so that the hormone is possible to avoid con@@ gest@@ ive measures in particular .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and leng@@ then their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ ting patients deliver no indication , that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ s@@ si@@ va , an increased risk for un@@ wanted events in the course of course and the result of pregnancy is .

the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies published the observ@@ ations into the great studies where Pro@@ c@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation , for the primary immun@@ o .
transplan@@ tation in an intermediate analysis over a recent , multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported in 110 patients who received a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ ization either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
chronic gra@@ fts , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ - syndrome , was often observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) than the number of patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute tran@@ spl@@ ant reactions occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) for the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ oma group larger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study was the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ mes in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treated patients significantly lower .

in the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by lack of factor VIII ) is used .
dosage and frequency of the application is determined whether in the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical intervention is applied .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from factor VIII , resulting in blood @-@ problems such as ble@@ eding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology : &quot;
it is produced by one cell that has been associated with a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of formation of the human plant@@ ing factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different product approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similarly , is produced differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe up to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well &quot; rated .
the most common adverse events of adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
sur@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may not be super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ ot@@ ation factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ or protein , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted marketing authorization to B@@ ax@@ ter AG to grant us an authorization to the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of Sub@@ st@@ itution is based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , according to the location and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients .
in the case of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in i.e. , i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is passed by the patient .
during treatment it is used to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections a reasonable determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ar .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different sem@@ iconductor problems .
3 Pre@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII is not achieved or when ble@@ eding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to re@@ ject an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the administration speed should be addressed after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation activity of factor VIII . Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma with modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors are cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is dependent on the most part of the world and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ural inhibit@@ ors was observed , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , re @-@ performed ( me@@ ar ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare adv@@ ent of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
in the largest number of patients treated with A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously untreated advanced risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , non @-@ known ( frequency based on the available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ( b ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was investigated during the whole time and by the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the cle@@ aring rate showed adequate values at the 15th post@@ oper@@ atively day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe up to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE one low In@@ hibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe up to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) by previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) an F@@ VIII @-@ inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients for inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on foot@@ steps of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ res against these proteins , laboratory and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms appeared on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the appearance of Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ ul@@ ocy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported on over@@ sensitivity actions of allergic type , including an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic / an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic / an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII is acting as a factor factor for activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated Factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE have been performed in treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( base value of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study using A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed below in Table 3 .

December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited , based on the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , officially announced that the company receives its request for approval by Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , the breast , brain , bones , or female parts ( tissue , which links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) of it .
there is a type of virus that genet@@ ically altered so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been changed so it does not produce copies of themselves and thus no infections can solve in humans .
in addition , an exc@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from non @-@ def@@ ectives in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , is usually used for restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company submitted data from a study with a patient who came to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of the sub@@ tree , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP support the answers to the questions submitted to him , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the reference of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , this CH@@ MP has not been demonstrated that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors have advantages for patients .
the Committee also has concerns relating to the processing of pharmac@@ euticals in the body , type of administration as well as the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not been demonstrated that an exc@@ ite can be manufactured in a reliable way and that neither for the environment nor for people who are in en@@ code contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP about it , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered efficiency release &quot; means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective parts are immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours released .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergi@@ es ( Gras@@ shop@@ pers of the nose ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( stopped nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is one tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the treatment duration should be as short as possible and terminated , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a skin .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of loc@@ ating symptoms , which were reported from the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
while the study carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ro@@ loc@@ ating symptoms , the patients reported a decline of symptoms reported by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % in the patients who received the P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin only .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al membran@@ es were considered , the patient showed a relief of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who had the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine only .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ving ( cardi@@ ac deficiency ) , as@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( Ru@@ is@@ os@@ el@@ ess@@ ness ) , const@@ ancy , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , sleep problems and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ rin , p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ore active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ins ( other drugs for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ onau@@ tics may not be used in patients who suffer hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( over@@ sight of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already had a h@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain ble@@ eding ) or had a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to grant approval for the market of aer@@ onau@@ tics in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is in total to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush , to break down or cut down ) .
aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data for in@@ ability and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after sl@@ ump of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use period to 10 days , because when long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can take time .
after the decline in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breath , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , the medicine is also con@@ tra @-@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ o@@ idal oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is attributable to alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with other v@@ aso@@ con@@ stri@@ ids , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , ery@@ amine or nas@@ al as an ab@@ dic@@ ular Rhin@@ oplast@@ y ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ al@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and the efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ ers were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed about the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or speed@@ ometer , heart rhyth@@ ms , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or et@@ eri@@ or other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or inter@@ p@@ ains of head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of the following patient groups : patients with heart rhyth@@ ms • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the angi@@ ography , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bel@@ lows or bronze age in the an@@ am@@ nese .
aer@@ in@@ aze should depos@@ ed at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ines are otherwise positive reactions to prevent skin reaction or to the extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clinical inter@@ actions or changes from Plas@@ ma@@ inst@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psychological tests , no significant differences were detected between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and who were treated with placebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ eth had been taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad@@ ata was not identified , so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ ability of the use of aer@@ onau@@ tics during pregnancy is not backed with experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to v@@ ascular characteristics of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should however be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , it can lead to severe impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , di@@ min@@ ed mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , cardiovascular disease ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ kking , co@@ ax ) with possible let@@ tering .
head@@ ache , anxi@@ ety , sc@@ aff@@ ection , muscle growth , heart rhyth@@ ms , heart rhyth@@ ms , heart failure , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , breathing and hyper@@ tension or h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely to do in children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( oral sick@@ ness , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ors of the adhes@@ ion of expression P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has no effect on standard measuring sizes of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective stro@@ kes or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in controlled clinical studies , there were no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily when compared to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage may cause further lik@@ able im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ k@@ kar@@ ate or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS control .
there were 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergi@@ es containing 414 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of aer@@ obic tablets , determined by the total of at least for the sympt@@ om ( except of no@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ) , significantly higher than under a monster with P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ onau@@ tics tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es , was significantly higher than under a monster with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ onau@@ tics tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in day 10 was reached .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic multi @-@ dos@@ sier that was conducted using formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was badly damaged .
a components of interaction shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the sole gift of p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ diesel was the exposure to the gift of a aer@@ ob@@ ine tablet .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , on tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , for com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproduction , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine did not know any particular d@@ angers to humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the content of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive tumor studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was administered in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the regulatory filing system was established and works before and during the product on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms , by preventing the hist@@ amine , its own substance , its effect can un@@ fold .
Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets lenses that occur in connection with seasonal allergi@@ es ( loc@@ ating ) occur , such as ni@@ es , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose and tr@@ end@@ or or ju@@ ck@@ ling eyes at the same const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal Rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies were submitted to verify that the body makes the sy@@ rup , solution the solution for adjusting and melting tablet in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( sympt@@ om number ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies of Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia the decrease of symptoms after six weeks treatment with A@@ erial 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ ch@@ adin , or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to grant approval from A@@ eri@@ us to the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with a or without a meal , to lin@@ king symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine during children aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous illness and may termin@@ ate and resum@@ ed after taking the symptoms .
during persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allerg@@ y period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected at clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not enhanced the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should however be clari@@ fied that it can be assumed in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in several indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported in placebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dri@@ est ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent tri@@ p@@ ains had been treated with 5.9 % of the patients treated with lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multiple clinical trial study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically important effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ors of the adhes@@ ion of expression P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of a clinical study involving multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily was administered over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
for a single dos@@ sh@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has no effect on standard measuring sizes of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective stro@@ kes or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in case of symptoms like ni@@ es , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ um and ro@@ cking of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the total of the questionn@@ aire in Rhin@@ o @-@ Im@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased its burden of allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been representative of further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology is ir@@ relevant at different forms and can be recruited as chronic patients .
as the hist@@ amine release is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected , except for chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia , besides chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ia too , in other forms of ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia to an improvement of symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of p@@ ur@@ itus and the amount of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of Jewish population by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients who were treated with placebo patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point rating for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study in which patients @-@ de@@ ograph@@ ies were comparable with the general seasonal allergi@@ es of Rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no maintenance points for clinical @-@ relevant Kum@@ ulation once a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5 to 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , that for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin enzyme was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded completely
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in vivo active not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ sier with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine a dose of 7.5 mg taken meals ( gre@@ asy , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed a comparative degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no quality or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproduction , pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot recognize any particular d@@ angers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to prevent the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ ti@@ kar@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are submitted to support a treatment of inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ omal@@ ies , the diagnosis of angi@@ ography , physical examination and related laboratory studies should play a role .
in about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed and experienced a higher medium @-@ load operating load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abolic , is identical to those with children who met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed normally .
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ al problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , glucose @-@ l@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ac disease in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected at clinical trials with A@@ erial tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not enhanced the performance of alcohol content ( see section 5.1 ) .
the th@@ reading of the side @-@ effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar at the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in several indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , have reported 3 % more adverse reactions in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically important effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years old , who came for one anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment in question , received a daily dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo was determined .
in single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets caused by adults and adolescents in clinical trials in no impair@@ ment of psych@@ ot@@ or@@ ic .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it came neither by the simultaneous consumption of alcohol nor to ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced power consumption to an increase in speed .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in lin@@ king symptoms such as ni@@ es , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and ro@@ cking of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
as indicated on the total of the total time of questionn@@ aire in Rhin@@ o @-@ Im@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets was effectively affected by seasonal allergi@@ es due to seasonal allergi@@ es
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of p@@ ur@@ itus and the amount of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose .
the prevalence of this restri@@ ctive phen@@ otyp@@ s was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are somewhat met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) caused by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was approximately 6 to 6 hours and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indication points for clinical @-@ relevant drug cum@@ ulation once a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5 to 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable with pedi@@ at@@ at@@ ric patients with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , that for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin enzyme , however was not identified , so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ids with non @-@ safe polypropylene closures with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ ats can be taken away without dam@@ aging .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ erial tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were applied in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in several indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported in patients treated with placebo .
in a multiple clinical trial study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically important effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ at was well toler@@ ated for inclusion ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals .
in the context of a clinical study involving multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily has been used daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in controlled clinical studies , there were no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily when compared to placebo .
at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has no effect on standard measuring sizes of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective stro@@ kes or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in case of symptoms such as ni@@ es , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and ro@@ cking of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
as shown by the total of the questionn@@ aire in Rhin@@ o @-@ Im@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased its burden of allergic rhin@@ itis .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov was to be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against the flu , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a trunk of influenza that could cause a future pan@@ demic .
a influenza pan@@ demic breaks out when a new tribe of flu virus is ge@@ di@@ fied , which can easily spread from human beings , because human beings still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
according to the vacc@@ ination of the vaccine , the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine contained in the influenza virus as &quot; physical alien . &quot;
this makes the immune system later in a position to create a contact with a flu virus of that gen@@ ms faster antibodies .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; Surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , are cleaned and considered a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not enough to meet the requirements of guidelines for the EMEA ( EMEA ) guidelines .
should you take part in a clinical study and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years associated with the immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which has caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low up the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the security of this combination was not explo@@ red .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines at the patient before , and the probability is judged that the virus will appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase is reduced by taking in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS do not cure or healing the damage of the immune system , thus creating the development of AIDS band@@ ages and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which were previously untreated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or .
the Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal product was compared with 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , compared with other proteins .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change in vir@@ al load after treatment .
in the studies with those who had previously received no proteins , had taken more patients with vir@@ al load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , but with the children that had been treated with prot@@ ease of death , only very few were addressed to treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , the vir@@ us@@ load increased its vir@@ al load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in patients with HIV that was resistant against four other proteins , it came together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ al load after four weeks , compared to the patient who continued its existing prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase should not be applied in patients who may potentially be super@@ natural ( allergic ) against d@@ det@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase should not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products , the same as A@@ gener@@ a , are supposed to be taken in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gen@@ ase are taken , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ och@@ on@@ dro@@ id ( absence of bone tissue ) or a immun@@ ore@@ activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of an infection that are caused by the resulting immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gen@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines prescribed for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifiers R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ al in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not detected .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; since the date of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted marketing authorization to the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to grant approval from A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , protein inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic booster of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ b@@ b@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than by am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and a solution for inclusion on one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams of base is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ pr@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ b@@ lown b@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be applied without the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses are applied to A@@ im@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ pr@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / kg of body@@ weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily average of 2400 mg of am@@ b@@ lown , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not investigated in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for in@@ solvency and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose to A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function increases to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the con@@ current application should be used in patients with light or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and additionally represent the substr@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ sor ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated date ) may not be applied due to risk reduced plasma concentration and a di@@ min@@ ated therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r during the dosage of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy did not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that she may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase prevents the risk of HIV on other due to sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ pr@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated to chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver disease with potentially fatal accidents .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing liver function , including an chronic active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ x@@ ason or other gluten @-@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which can be conf@@ used by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment system@@ ic cor@@ related effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the tri@@ gu@@ er@@ en@@ function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the reduction of the H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to increased risk of my@@ op@@ ias including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the international con@@ formance ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of the concentration .
in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective for reduced plasma levels of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the ability to met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r its effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrast can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ym@@ ph no@@ d , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in particular .
because of the possible risk of a tox@@ icity according to the high propylene gly@@ col solution , this formulation is inde@@ xed in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution at certain other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set to duration 5 , if a r@@ ash is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy , which were associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drugs , dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated with associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in case of ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) which were treated with proteins , there are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding , including spontan@@ eous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ oph@@ thro@@ at .
in cases of anti @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ def@@ ective therapy ( ART ) a del@@ ight@@ ful reaction on as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections evol@@ ves to develop severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial equ@@ is@@ ology is assumed ( including an application of Kor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ id , alcohol consumption , heavy body@@ weight , higher body Mass @-@ index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ ase should not possess at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent the substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can not be used together with medicines that are mainly conf@@ used with medicines that are mainly associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 which are predominantly associated with serious and / or vi@@ vid side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical result and can lead to a resistance development .
in an attempt to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The serum levels of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be ab@@ ased by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) .
if a patient has already incorporated Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ id@@ av@@ irus and , if possible , check the Vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ sor of the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ dar@@ k@@ r is administered with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ aring ir@@ cle below ) .
up to 508 % increased , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ b@@ lown b@@ r were used twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and in@@ sights of this treatment schem@@ atic .
in combination with cal@@ ab@@ ra ( 750 mg twice daily ) occurs in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of L@@ op@@ in@@ viol@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination with am@@ b@@ lown b@@ r ( 600 mg of L@@ op@@ in@@ viol@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ b@@ lown b@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however it is recommended not to be a close monitoring , as the efficacy and in@@ ability of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study on the application of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene , but is suggested due to the ant@@ ech@@ ari@@ os@@ en@@ ic component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene that the revenues of Di@@ dan in and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adap@@ tion is required .
treatment with vent@@ ures in combination with am@@ b@@ b@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be one .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing data can be avoided that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may potentially reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ perf@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din was less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if this medicine is applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made because a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to use Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the con@@ current administration of Am@@ perf@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ inst@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and thus an increase in associated adverse events .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ pp@@ ut@@ in together with ad@@ gener@@ ase are advised to a reduction of the dose of rift in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , however , the plasma concentration of both medicines could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration .
at once , the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ons and 100 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole taken once daily , to increase the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without con@@ current application of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ons with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below are including substr@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 if they are used together with A@@ pr@@ ase , possibly inter@@ actions to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are related to these medicines when they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the con@@ current application of Anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzy@@ mes are known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower plasma tor@@ sion of ampl@@ b@@ b@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium blocks such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ pine , ne@@ odi@@ pine , ne@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ bo@@ di@@ pin , n@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ b@@ lown up , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentration and increases with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ation , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study conducted in R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 μ@@ g of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma protein rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the con@@ current gift of A@@ pr@@ ong with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended to do with these Gl@@ ucose co@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of treatment system@@ ic co@@ ti@@ co@@ er@@ ero@@ ding effects ex@@ ited ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose processing is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , increased increases of plasma levels when compared to A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma resistance of these H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended .
it is recommended for a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ ization of mirrors as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be increased in the same time as am@@ id@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in addition , A@@ gen@@ ase can not be used together with oral l@@ ord@@ z@@ ol@@ eic acid ( see section 4.3 ) , while the application of A@@ gen@@ ase comes with par@@ ent@@ ric Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ ent@@ eous Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other proteins inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
if Meth@@ ad@@ one is given up with am@@ b@@ b@@ lown , the patient should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ e@@ pl@@ omas , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in particular .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , currently no recommendation can be given , such as the am@@ id@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is given when Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in case of simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( international normal@@ ization ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of im@@ pregn@@ ation or reinforcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal counter@@ act is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after a careful extraction of possible uses for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fo@@ et@@ us .
in the milk l@@ ur@@ ged rats were detected Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , it is not known whether am@@ id@@ avi@@ r is over@@ coming into breast milk .
a re@@ productive study on the rats who was given to the u@@ terus until the end of the u@@ terus until the end of the u@@ terus , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the u@@ terus .
further development of the offspring including fertil@@ ity and reproduction was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ perf@@ avi@@ r in the womb .
the in@@ solvency of A@@ gen@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment associated with side @-@ side effects were slightly up to moderate , rising early in early and led them rare for treatment .
many of these events is not clari@@ fy whether it is related to the in@@ gest@@ ion of A@@ pr@@ ase or another simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a sequence of lung disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects date from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which prot@@ ested not treated 1200 mg of A@@ pr@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , used by the doctors accredited in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients occurred , and also under the treatment phases ( degree 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a dis@@ si@@ der@@ ive and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat collection ( Sti@@ cks ) .
in case of 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated who had been treated with Am@@ ber avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ ine , was observed in a medium term of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ C , patients were up to 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) for 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
skin fail@@ ures were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ thematic or ma@@ stur@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and appeared spontan@@ e@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ e@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ b@@ lown b@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ def@@ ective therapy , an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) may develop a flamm@@ able reaction on as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients , 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase received twice daily together with low dos@@ si@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) of those diagnosed in patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dosage the patient must be observed on the signs of a po@@ is@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary to initi@@ ate necessary measures necessary .

the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of the am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both at acute and chronic l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ at@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ b@@ lown viol@@ ated against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in human being is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients with the currently approved f@@ os@@ amp@@ ons / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - such as other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ es were observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
at sixteen anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients , the 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ons had received 100@@ mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical delay of up to week 48 , where 14 ins@@ ulating gen@@ otyp@@ ic could be investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the insulation of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ logical desp@@ air within the 59 included , showed no @-@ treated patients , showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults .

gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance analysis based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ins@@ ulating isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ ons / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the availability of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V / W / S / S / S / W / W / S / S / W / W / S / W / W / S / W / W / S / W / W / S / S / W / V / V / V / V / F / S / F / S / V / V / V / V / V / V / F / S / V / V / V / V / F / S / V / V / V / V / V / F / S / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ s can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to move the current interpre@@ tations to evaluate the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ical data interpretation analysis based in the gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems can be applied in connection with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ins@@ ulating isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( Separ@@ ation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of the resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ b@@ lown avi@@ r associated genet@@ ically creates a certain cross@@ resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ ocols for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ons N@@ avi@@ d resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients ( one of them demonstrated a resistance against L@@ op@@ in@@ viol@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ ab@@ in@@ viol@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ats ) and Tip@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
the reverse reserves the am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to isol@@ ate its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and of the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to hold the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders that can influence on the subsequent treatment .
the cover is based on the efficacy of A@@ pr@@ a in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ y anal@@ ysts ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; received .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with a proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the research study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in relation to the period @-@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the vir@@ al load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ le@@ gen@@ ic wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of untreated A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ pr@@ ase &apos;s solution was administered three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of patients treated with A@@ gener@@ ase administered N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .

following oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
at a level of 508 % , the C@@ max should be reduced by 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ b@@ lown b@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to the dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows an un@@ stable penetration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bo@@ unded am@@ b@@ b@@ lown , which remains unchanged , probably unchanged .

the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r exposure such as adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bi@@ over@@ available as taken from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on one million@@ th base .
also , the ren@@ al cle@@ aring of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al disorder affects the elim@@ ination of ampl@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be applied without the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses must be applied ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ pr@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / kg of body@@ weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily average of 2400 mg of am@@ b@@ lown , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .

if a dose is left out , the patient apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy schedule .
in a thin layer , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and using the infected skin area , until the cream is completely dissolved .
in these patients the treatment is eff@@ ected between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients , considering the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and a possible organ@@ ism , or Gra@@ ft @-@ host@@ esses , it should become inter@@ dependent .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ ori@@ ene were carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and one case were observed with one to the circumcision .
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk for severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation observed , which led to a treatment and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties when water , which required a emer@@ gen@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
previously , there are no clinical experiences for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od surface immediately following the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
limited data suggest an increased rate of cer@@ vical pre @-@ reductions at HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in this patient group has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair principle was not examined .
local skin actions are frequently , but the intensity of these reactions occur in general during therapy or the reactions form after the completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patients or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin actions , a treatment break of several days may be made .
the results of the therapy can be assessed after re@@ generation of the treated skin after 12 weeks after treatment .
as there are currently no data about long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , no appropriate therapeutic cell car@@ cin@@ oma should be drawn into consideration with non @-@ term bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and treated B@@ CC@@ s no clinical experiences were before , therefore , the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study demonstrate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) there is a lower lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not tested for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent not@@ ches , inside the nose or ears or in the ears or in the way @-@ way area .
only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ atic not@@ ches outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data about the acute not@@ at@@ osis in poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application case , therefore no such application is not recommended .
local skin actions occur frequently , but these reactions occur normally in the course of the therapy at intensity or continue after the use of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
if local skin actions cause big dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acute les@@ ions found a lower full healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be used with caution in patients who received an immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies are no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ al development , integration , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after an exceptional top@@ ical use , an anti@@ fi@@ able serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be achieved , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding period .
most frequently co @-@ shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of gra@@ dients ( 3@@ 3.7 % of treated patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
among the most widely reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream related side effects include complaints in the application area with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the PA@@ 185 treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects were presented below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream in connection , were a reaction to the application place ( 22 % of treated patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
side effects , which were listed by 252 in plac@@ eb@@ re controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ itious ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
an evaluation of the clinical evidence shows that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream frequently came to local skin reaction including Er@@ y@@ iel@@ ding ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / leaves ( 30 % ) and econom@@ ies ( 14 % ) and econom@@ ies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
an evaluation of the clinical evidence shows that in these studies there were five times a weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and severe pain @-@ formation and short@@ ening ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to investigate the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , al@@ pe@@ zie was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the ambient range .
the extraordinary , one @-@ off oral intake of 200 m@@ g. of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , corresponding to the content of about 16 bags could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe adverse events that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , normal@@ ized in the h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony , normal@@ ized in oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic investigation , an increasing systematic concentration of alpha inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected in the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy in relation could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing process at a I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior .
at 60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated patients who had been treated completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 treated with placebo in case of patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a full healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 with placebo male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target areas were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; were healed of all treated patients , and these remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , non @-@ hyper@@ t@@ orious ac@@ ic les@@ ions within a related 25 cm2 large treatment room on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or on the face .
half @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ations studies show a recur@@ rent retinal rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) in two combined observ@@ ations .
the permitted indications , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ duc@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually not on and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the evaluated dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or
a minimal systematic taking of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute not@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and ranged from 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 pur@@ se ) , on the scal@@ p ( 75 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated semi @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study . based on a prolonged reten@@ tion of medicine in the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the top@@ ical application of MC @-@ diagnosed eyes of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adult or adults with ac@@ tin@@ y@@ tic acid cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month survey of the tox@@ icity in the rats introduced doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg . kg , significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a further four months study on the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at three days per week induced no tum@@ ors at the use of the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systematic absorption of human skin and not mut@@ an@@ ages , is a risk for human exposure due to the systematic exposure as very small .
the tum@@ ors were treated in mice that was treated with actual cream @-@ free cream , and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ en@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms who do not stand with brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ co@@ amin@@ o@@ gly@@ ca@@ e , GA@@ Gs ) are not dis@@ assembled , and therefore in most organs in the body and to compens@@ ate them .
the following non @-@ logical symptoms of MP@@ S I may occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements are difficult , reducing lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with alt@@ ar@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ ig@@ or@@ ating devices , and the patients need to prevent appropriate drugs before the administration to prevent allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver has been investigated ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me established the G@@ AG concentrations in urine in around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver in the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , abdom@@ inal pain , arth@@ rop@@ ath@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , Hitler feeling , fever and reactions .
very frequent eye @-@ effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sc@@ oring .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may react strongly in patients who are possibly highly sensitive ( allergic ) on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) , not applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year all new information that may possibly be known , and this summary will be necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission granted the G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. Initi@@ ator to grant approval to the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human@@ kind α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA - using Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ ier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ g , egg stock of the Chinese Ham@@ mond ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for long @-@ term en@@ vir@@ al therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ q@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ d ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) inde@@ xed to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with alt@@ ar@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial inf@@ ancy rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient underwent a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for those patients , no dosing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency is not determined , and for those patients , no dosing scheme can be recommended .
in patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop inf@@ alli@@ ble reactions that are defined as each in connection , which occurs during the infusion of infusion or until the end of the infusion of infusion ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients still should also be monitored , and the infusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be made only in a reasonable clinical environment , where re@@ organizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are generally accepted , generally within 3 months of treatment .
patients , the antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usions are to be treated with caution must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience in the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity to a inter@@ ruption of treatment , caution must be c@@ auti@@ ous .
60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ ster@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of inf@@ use reactions .
in case of a light or medium inf@@ usions , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen could be considered and / or a reduction of the Inf@@ ante rate on the half of the inf@@ usions .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usions , the infusion must be stopped , until the symptoms have to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is too expensive .
infusion with the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate , when the infusion occurred , must be resum@@ ed .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usions 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usions .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Pro@@ c@@ ain because a potential @-@ risk of interference with intra@@ cellular recording of lar@@ gen@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies allow not to direct or indirect impacts on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
as no result of new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ically exposed over the milk above the breast milk , it is recommended to not @-@ quiet during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse reactions in clinical trials were classified mainly as inf@@ usions in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted medicine activities related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and of an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S I @-@ related involvement of the upper respir@@ atory system and lungs beside the pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bronze , breath@@ able and fac@@ ial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , were reported in the table with greater heavier form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most cases the treatment occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a serum @-@ version , whereby it was mostly given for patients at the age of 5 ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to an early departure from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients were not det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ oh@@ im@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low @-@ physical mirrors were a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n while in patients with high anti @-@ antibody tit@@ ers to be able to determine a variable decrease of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) demonstrated a mar@@ g@@ inal to low @-@ neutr@@ al@@ izing effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be associated with the incidence of adverse drugs , even if the incidence of un@@ wanted drugs are typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for enzyme therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative substr@@ ate and the prevention of a further accum@@ ulation of adequate processing .
after an intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken from circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the entire path@@ ological spectrum was recruited , the majority of the patients were observed from the mid @-@ phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phenom@@ otype .
patients were recruited when they had an exp@@ c@@ ised exp@@ ir@@ ational volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for a further 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week .
after 26 weeks therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma were treated with an improvement of lung function and the ability to prove that is shown in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as out of the following table .
the decrease in the percentage of the FE@@ V is not significantly higher than that period of clinical and absolute pul@@ mon@@ ial volumes increased propor@@ tionally to a height of growing children .
of the 26 patients treated with a H@@ ep@@ atomic al@@ ie before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear trend for the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined that remained constant until the study programme .
in regard to the heter@@ ogen@@ eous illness of patients suffering from combined end@@ points , clin@@ ically significant changes between the patients ( 6 % ) , the course of shoulder straps ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a single @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted , where the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied at 20 patients , who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy vertical form and 4 with the middle course type ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) demonstrated after the Z @-@ Score for those age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ run form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe evap@@ or@@ ating form only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations were conducted using dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ es based on the G@@ AG mirrors in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have trouble with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two doses are equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information that will rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features will be updated automatically .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in continuous administration , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift and reproduction technology , pre@@ clinical data may be no particular d@@ angers to humans .

the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form comes in cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of medication and a longer term of cancer cells .
in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease in a main study of 456 patients .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had been treated with chemotherapy , compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other drugs against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived on average 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the single administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el at 7.9 months .
however , in both studies , patients who were unable to attack the cancer epi@@ thel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta prolonged survival times than that of previous medicine .

the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the P@@ emet@@ ry - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
in patients with a non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 days treatment course .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction , the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ free gift as well as on the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third check @-@ in cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ emet@@ ry , it should be created before any gift a complete ble@@ eding - including the differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ k counting .
the Alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose inspection must take place under Con@@ dition of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
following a recovery the patients must be treated according to the indications in Figures 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therap@@ ist in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute of Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC 1998 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
if patients were non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient must decrease the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of dose or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in the age of 65 years of age or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased epi@@ thel@@ ial side consists of .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for in@@ solvency and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments required to go beyond the dose adjustments for all patients .
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold in the upper Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in det@@ ecting liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not especially examined in studies .
patients must be observed with regard to the bone mark@@ er systems and P@@ emet@@ ry can not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic index is again given a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thes@@ es number of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic numbers , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ k numbers and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .

therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients are demanded , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ ate measures to be used to reduce waste @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must be at least 2 days before therapy , at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ alism ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients who have been en@@ acted with P@@ emet@@ ry is to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before therapy , the day of therapy and minimum 2 days after therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients , where these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - accum@@ ulator in trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ ining of the influence of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment is required .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ ry occasionally when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ated life di@@ mm@@ ing ( except yellow fi@@ e@@ ber , these vacc@@ ination is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .

Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , the heavy trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemotherapy for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of an Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti @-@ emet@@ ry ) .
the use of patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group does not have enough information .
this means that the active ingredient prevented the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
chemotherapy , the heavy trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with al@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with al@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for al@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a permit for the placing on the market of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : prevention of evacu@@ ated nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in heavily em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer treatment and vom@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of al@@ xi regarding prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids by adding one prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on , patients with an am@@ nesty or indication of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored according to injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the benefit of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is prolonged or extending to such an extension .
but in connection with any other chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in days after chemotherapy nor to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials in@@ hib@@ ited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron against tum@@ ours of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ak , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , chlor@@ o@@ idal , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ xy@@ et@@ ine , rheumat@@ oid , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) were no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregnancy are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women because it is considered necessary by the treated physician than necessary .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least probably stood with al@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ jects ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions at the administration site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ focused experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar buildings showed un@@ wanted events of adverse events such as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose of action to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out because of the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis however probably did not have any effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - excess .
in two randomised double blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients were treated with a ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ason .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in , as well as 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , received intraven@@ ously on Day 1 .
results of the study with moderate @-@ class chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ cies are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the relevant effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ on@@ ary channels and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. ab@@ brevi@@ ated Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial elim@@ ination of plasma concentration from the body with an average terminal @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg for patients and cancer patients .
after an intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 ho@@ ary car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma tor@@ ial at 42 ± 34 % .
out of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic sim@@ ulations , that at once daily an intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached a total value of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the one @-@ off of 0.75 mg higher was higher .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for Met@@ abol@@ ism , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , which occur at Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , palm oil than un@@ altered ingredient made about 40 % given the given dose .
after an injection intraven@@ ous injection , the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ aring 53 ± 29 ml / min .
indeed , in patients with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ ination and average systematic exposure has been increased with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate above the maximum human exposure , which indicates a minor relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of pre@@ clinical studies , evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron may only block in very high levels of icon@@ duc@@ es , which are involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ formation and rep@@ lication .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded over two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumor , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ci@@ men ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , epi@@ di@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and as Alo@@ xi working for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of this results is low as for mankind .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of authorization for the treatment of hepatitis C provided medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C used for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml In@@ jection solution .
this means , Alph@@ eon has been using an organic medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same practition@@ er , which is supposed to be approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference case &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a lasting liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue injury also shows the values of the liver enzy@@ mes Al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood norm .
it is produced by a yeast which resulted in a gene that stim@@ ulates a gene ( DNA ) in which it stim@@ ulates the formation of the material .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon published data , which prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( effic@@ ien@@ cies , composition and purity of pharmac@@ euticals , efficiency , security and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ i@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is the major concerns relating to CH@@ MP about the recommendation ?
in addition , concerns demanded that the data on the stability of the drug and the mark@@ eted drugs have not been sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after setting up the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was again kindled against more patients than in reference to reference , Alph@@ eon has more side effects .
in addition , the test carried out in the study to study the question , to what extent the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. , the body is antibodies - against the medic@@ inal product ) , not suff@@ iciently vali@@ dated .
it may be used for the treatment of im@@ et@@ igo ( a cr@@ ust @-@ infection ) and small in@@ fic@@ ated in@@ fir@@ mary ( tear or slic@@ ing ) , am@@ orti@@ zation and pil@@ es wounds can be applied .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used to treat infections which have been det@@ ectable or probably by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because bur@@ go against this kind of infections may not work .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be applied in patients with the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin surface must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should investigate patients once again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by block the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the bacteria &apos;s growth .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was denied after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin samples , alt@@ ar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of patients showed on treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , alt@@ ar@@ go was detected at the treatment of g@@ inal ( hollow shafts in the body tissue ) or infections which have been det@@ ectable , or probably by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough .
the most common adverse events with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the principal point .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ time treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Imp@@ et@@ igo , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ing , de@@ vis@@ or or pil@@ ed wounds .
in May 2007 the European Commission granted marketing authorization to the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit to be granted by Al@@ tar@@ go into the European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be considered to be considered and an alternative effect can be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sen@@ si@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is thrown carefully , the oint@@ ment carefully selected and an adequate alternative treatment of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , in which M@@ RSA is known or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary operations , the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ulin was caused by retin@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy is considered to be considered , if a 2 or 3 @-@ day treatment does not enter any improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and con@@ current application of other top@@ ographic products is not recommended .
based on the low plasma concentration , which were obtained after top@@ ical use in a pre@@ heated skin or surface area , a clinical @-@ relevant inhibit@@ or has not been expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the same period of two times daily , 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mid @-@ dose Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on slo@@ ped skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to its low systematic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments are not necessary , when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 for inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a prec@@ in@@ tox@@ icity according to oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and f@@ öt@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was able to prevent the application of a systematic anti@@ bi@@ otic .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with alt@@ ar@@ go continued / terminated , is between the benefit of the n@@ urs@@ ing for the inf@@ ant and benefit from the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy to the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections which applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported tri@@ rit@@ ation by appointment , which was about 1 % of patients .
effect of the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated due to fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly pic@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein syn@@ thes@@ es due to a particular connec@@ tor@@ sion of the 50s base unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om which differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ act anti @-@ bacterial substances .
please indicate that the binding section ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bonds and the Pep@@ tide @-@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by connecting to this binder , P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine to the Pep@@ tide transfer , some P @-@ bonds inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om sub@@ units .
shou@@ ldn &apos;t appear on the reason of the local prevalence of the resistance to Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ectious diseases , an advice should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ants ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was taken daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and lowered skin for up to 7 days .
from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary @-@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma proteins were captured .
the rehear@@ sal was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording on humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 cm2 with di@@ ced skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes was pressed primarily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id problems .
in vitro testing on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ l@@ ym@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ core for in @-@ vivo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither in male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in order to achieve up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest exposure of human beings ( top@@ ical application on 200 cm2 ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were determined at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development tools ( reduced body weight ) and mat@@ er@@ ale tox@@ icity .
the holder of approval for placing on the market has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ility system , as in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is present and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the product market is applied .
the holder of approval for placing on the market is obliged to perform in further detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ov@@ ulation activities , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver with children aged between one and 15 years , which are not imm@@ ov@@ able against these two diseases .
Am@@ bi@@ rix is applied in the context of one of two doses of existing vaccine , with which the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Am@@ bi@@ rix allows only to be used whenever the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination can be carried out from two doses .
if a check @-@ out dose is required against hepatitis A or B , Am@@ bi@@ rix or other Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine is given .
vacc@@ ines may work by increasing the immune system ( the natural body of the body ) , &quot; as a disease can defend itself .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produced antibodies against it .
Am@@ bi@@ rix contains the same components as the individual vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ ination vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vaccine .
because Am@@ bi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as cover for the application of Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of im@@ min@@ ated children who had developed a month after the final injection of protective antibodies .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
the Am@@ bi@@ rix starts between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last inj@@ ections to the development of protective antibodies against Hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Am@@ bi@@ rix was with a six @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Am@@ bi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain , vit@@ ality ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
the Am@@ bi@@ rix must react to patients who are possibly super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients that react to any other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ s.@@ a. a permit to be granted to the market of Am@@ bi@@ rix in the entire
the di@@ mm@@ ing di@@ mm@@ ing plan for the ground di@@ mm@@ ing with Am@@ bi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given by the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a check @-@ out is required for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with appropriate vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C anti @-@ hepatitis C surface and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody @-@ anti @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully secured whether immun@@ ore@@ mentioned persons , which are addressed to a hepatitis - vacc@@ ination , as they may also be protected against the immun@@ ologic memory because of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As in all inj@@ ections of inj@@ ectors , for the rare case of an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction according to the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the stand @-@ di@@ mm@@ ing scheme is recommended to produce 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with interference in the immune system , no incen@@ tive anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ vit@@ re@@ ous could be achieved in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required in these cases .
as an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration may result in the glut@@ eal muscles to an optimal im@@ pulses should be avoided .
in these cases , Am@@ bi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases , as having in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular relationship with ble@@ eding .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate inj@@ ections at the same time with a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ or , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus C@@ yr@@ a @-@ R@@ öt@@ tle vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ def@@ ective therapy or in patients suffering from immun@@ def@@ ective , no adequate immune response must be achieved .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ ines of these form@@ ulations in adults was the frequency of pain , ro@@ unding , vibration , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable with frequency that was observed in the previous thi@@ omer@@ anian and preserv@@ ative vaccine .
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Am@@ bi@@ rix were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 imports at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants from the age of 12 to and including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Am@@ bi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combined combination .
the only exceptions was the higher number of pain and mat@@ er@@ ity at a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Am@@ bi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Am@@ bi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination sim@@ ulated .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects were given to Am@@ bi@@ rix , over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the incidence of mat@@ ism was compared per pro@@ filing ( i.e. above the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of the subjects who received Am@@ bi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects which received the 3 doses of combination sim@@ ulated ) .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and del@@ ity was low and comparable to the administration of combination sim@@ ulated with the 3 @-@ cans of vacc@@ ination .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , the appearance of local re@@ actions and general actions occurred in the am@@ bi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable to those with the 3 @-@ cans combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6- @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix a common appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not reported per pro@@ filing , is reported .
the proportion of im@@ pregn@@ ated impacts on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ ination with hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of combin@@ able Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen reported , was statistically significant .
in clinical trials that were carried out in imports at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the serum rates of anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were given a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the serum levels of anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , there were two doses of Am@@ bi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ants with three doses .
for the 289 , whose immun@@ ity was trained , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors were significantly higher ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3 @-@ dose im@@ pot@@ ency significantly higher than with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
the immune response shown in a clinical trial study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds would be reached after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , imports were either a 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ination with am@@ bi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies confirmed at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies in 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immun@@ ity reaction observed in this study was comparable to that of vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination simulation , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ antibodies are comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination opening at 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .

the hepatitis C virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al @-@ based food@@ stuffs and beverages , but may also be transferred by other ways , such as bathing in through water @-@ contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , a dark urine , a p@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms , possibly a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Am@@ bi@@ rix can not be fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are inf@@ ill / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Am@@ bi@@ rix are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child should not feel un@@ well or ill / feel ) a vaccine could possibly prevent a vaccine .
a protection against other infections that inflic@@ t liver fo@@ xes or symptoms which are similar to those with hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Am@@ bi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be derived by ju@@ ck@@ ende of skin , respir@@ atory , or sc@@ aff@@ ections of the face or tongue . if you have a allergic reaction on an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a serious infection with a fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the conven@@ tions of the second vaccine dose ) .
for a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B in the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Am@@ bi@@ rix .
instead , it is recommended to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine , with reduced content to effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination against vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Am@@ bi@@ rix starts with persons suffering from severe ble@@ eding disorders , under the skin and not in muscle tissues . • If you are weak@@ ened by a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child moves on a her@@ m@@ aly@@ sis .
Am@@ bi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction on vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you receive any further medicines / register ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without en@@ rol@@ ment ) or if you have been given / your child recently / or Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have been given / or who is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine , and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Am@@ bi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate digits and as possible as possible different limb@@ s .
if Am@@ bi@@ rix must be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction on the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually Am@@ bi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women should not be given , except it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Am@@ bi@@ rix Please inform your doctor when using your child or your child once a allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccine , please talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Am@@ bi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known since the approval of the first authorization for placing on the market , CH@@ MP has shown that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Am@@ bi@@ rix remains positive .
however , Am@@ bi@@ rix was only transferred to a Member State in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) and is limited to the available safety data for this medicine based on small patient exposure .
Ammon@@ ites can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ complete en@@ def@@ ective enzyme or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ tic sten@@ itic sus@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( Hir@@ n@@ icious due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) .
Ammon@@ ites is divided - split up to several single doses to meals - to be swallowed under the food or via a Gast@@ bell bar ( included in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a no@@ ens@@ ity ( with the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
this was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ opol@@ y did not compare with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo which can be compared without active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ ition may also help App@@ et@@ ite loss , a abnormal acidity level in the blood , depression , friction p@@ ains , abdom@@ inal pain , rest@@ rained , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin impact , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ opol@@ y in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle is beneficial to high am@@ mon@@ ium values .
Ammon@@ ites was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with which a complete enzyme could already be manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a delayed form ( complete enzyme def@@ ective , who is manifested after the first life of life ) there is an indication for the use when the am@@ an@@ ism exists a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for babies , suitable for infants , who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with s@@ ut@@ ching disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in Gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily intake of the patient .
after previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day , with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early physical deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate phosph@@ at@@ yl cellulose , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine is needed in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ synthetic deficiency have to get Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with s@@ ill@@ ary disorders , as there is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately going to the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 m@@ mol ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with So@@ dium and ec@@ om@@ in@@ ating clinical states only with caution .
because Met@@ abol@@ isation and elim@@ ination of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat exceeds the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal im@@ pul@@ sion and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
a delayed matur@@ ation of shred@@ ded syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and there@@ with a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ im is left out of humans in breast milk , and this is why the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is cont@@ inde@@ xed during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events had assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ano@@ vic patient in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ oth , heavier hypo@@ thes@@ emia , m@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
the case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old small child with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 grams ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day for dos@@ si@@ bl@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ c is a met@@ abolic compound , compliant with glut@@ amine by glut@@ amine into phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , made through the kidneys ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the loss of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ ruption of the ure@@ ter cycle can be assumed that for each gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early , and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the predi@@ ction of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease itself led to treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , with their st@@ ick@@ ed anal@@ ysts in the first year of life .
by Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative means of nit@@ rate pollution ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium subst@@ itution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newly born in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first living ) diagnostic ill@@ iter@@ ated diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic en@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients suffering from mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ ien@@ cies .
in patients with a delayed form of the disease ( including female patients with heter@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly par@@ rot bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet was 98 % .
even existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ actic acet@@ ate , which is produced in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , being produced in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g. of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , according to individual and repet@@ itive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and Met@@ abol@@ ite was also examined at cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ic .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets form 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in retin@@ opath@@ y , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable by a phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ic acid in plasma by the next morning .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration was five times higher than after the first gifts .
the loss of medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours of about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either or@@ ally taken by or@@ ally ( infants and children , who may not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with s@@ ling problems ) or via an inn .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day , with a body weight over 20 kg and with child @-@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early physical deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate phosph@@ at@@ yl cellulose , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine is needed in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were subjected to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ actic acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there came into les@@ ions in the pyramid of Hir@@ n@@ r@@ ens .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ano@@ vic patient in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ oth , heavier hypo@@ thes@@ emia , m@@ anz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine using urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier on the loss of excess
on the basis of investigations about the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ ruption of the ur@@ inary cycle , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
even existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found .
during the duration of durability , the patient can retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
for this approach the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient need to receive a probe above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzy@@ mes , such that they are unable to ex@@ ert proteins in the body for consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are conducted laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ies if you have taken other drugs or recently taken if it is not pres@@ cription medic@@ inal medicines .
during the breast@@ feeding time , you cannot take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine could survive the breast milk and your baby could harm .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , pain @-@ problems , desc@@ end@@ ure , disin@@ ter@@ ti@@ bility , reminder , and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , use immediately with your doctor or with the notification of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment in combination .
if you forgot the dosage of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ies if you have taken other drugs or recently taken if it is not pres@@ cription medic@@ inal medicines .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on the same single doses or via a Mag@@ en@@ f@@ ist@@ el ( hose , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall in the stomach ) or one no@@ ens@@ ity ( hose that is passed through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of Gran@@ ules . • Up to a straight edge , e.g. a measuring back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon Gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable n@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest cor@@ ps with different thickness ) or my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who are subjected to a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion may be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox@@ a @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
while the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a buck@@ le , and they received also other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
for the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI for the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart inci@@ dents or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients that were subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox@@ in relation to all indicators did as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for serious ble@@ eding , with which it was much more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may potentially be super@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who had recently sent a ble@@ eding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin treatment with a PCI and a PCI option .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company of Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to grant approval for authorisation from An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ ST@@ E@@ MI ) ) in an emergency handle or if an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initi@@ ating dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous pin of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if another PCI is carried out in the case of the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion in the intervention can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced inf@@ usions increased from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of a initiated intraven@@ ous bolts of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us @-@ Gabe of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended , even if a short PCI en@@ cro@@ achment is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to below 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg body weight should be charged .
in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before applying the application and given the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly intraven@@ ously .
if the ACT value exceeds more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , that one PCI should be undergo ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower idle rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be applied .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg should be applied and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose again .
in patients with moderate kidney stones , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT received 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without any dose adaptation at an average rate of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ dependent patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be re@@ directed 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ fra@@ ction H@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of Lower H@@ ep@@ arin .

patients are treated carefully in connection with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially when bi@@ valent in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ m@@ ud@@ ings occur in most ble@@ eding an arter@@ ial pun@@ cture , in patients who undergo a sub@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment principle occur everywhere .
in patients who are treated with war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent ir@@ ants , a monitoring of IN@@ R commerci@@ ally should be drawn into consideration in order to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ valent ir@@ ants will again be achieved prior to the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ce aggreg@@ ated ) can assume that these substances are increasing blood flow .
combined with the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ce aggreg@@ ation@@ ers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ ative parameters in each case regularly .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged 6 years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the upper arm or the upper arm or administered as a continuous discharge with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or non @-@ insulin @-@ insulin .
insulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter duration has as a short @-@ effective human effect .
A@@ pi@@ dra was included in the application in combination with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce an insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
for type 2 diabetes , non @-@ effective diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the amendment to the concentration of substance gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.14 % to insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % for human beings .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly over @-@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or one of the other constitu@@ ents , or in patients who have already suffer hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may possibly be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can effect on the glu@@ tide .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ ko@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to grant approval for the market traffic of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , the th@@ igh , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdom@@ inal product .
due to the reduced happiness capacity and di@@ min@@ ished insulin production , the insulin need for patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of impact strength , the brand ( Her@@ on St@@ eller ) , the insulin @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the kind of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or manufacturing method can move to a change of insulin .
3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or the termination of a treatment , particularly in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin delivery should take place under str@@ ingent supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the effects of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the impact profile of the insulin , and therefore it can change while switching the treatment schem@@ es .
the substances that increase blood sugar activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , include oral anti@@ diabet@@ ic , disper@@ sion @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ins , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ins , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and Sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics .

animal experimental studies on reag@@ ents showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ity in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

after a glucose @-@ injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the original cause of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peripheral glucose consumption ( especially through Sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous alle@@ dor@@ ms of insulin is becoming faster and the efficiency is shorter than hu@@ - man@@ em normal chlorine .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years old with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ relevant doses of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg demonstrated a proportional to a proportional glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glu@@ eing effect , exactly as Human@@ itarian .
