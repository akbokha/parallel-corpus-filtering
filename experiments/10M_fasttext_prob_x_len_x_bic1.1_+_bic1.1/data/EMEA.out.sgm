<seg id="1">This document is a summary of European public relations report (EPAR), explained in which analyzed, as the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the carried out in order to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the packagage (also part of the EPAR) or turn to your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablet (tablets that opened in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. confessing thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and insets; • bipolar disorder in which the patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal accumulation) alternate with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilisi is used for treatment of moderate to severe episodes and prevention of poor episodes for patients who have been addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied for fast control of disturbance or behavioural troubles when the oral ingestion of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to one or the processed tablet for patients, where swallow up tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilisi should be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells due to "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of the nerve cells each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ariadjole goes primarily as "partial Agility" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Arizjylbenzene as 5-Hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Arizjole wearing the activity of the brain to normalize psychotic or manian symptoms and their reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilled, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses that had been compared to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilixed more than twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study carried out the efficacy of Abilical and placebo to occur in 160 patients in which the manian symptoms had already been stabilized at Abilisi.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilical Injection solution was performed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder which had an increased disturbance, which was compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led trials to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablet and the solution for inclusion (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies involving the injection solution, patients who received Abilled in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly more severe reductions of symptoms who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of five short-time studies the symptoms were more effective than placebo in four of five short-time studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilled prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo received the re-perform episodes on previously treated patients and when it was additionally given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilical injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo perceived the symptoms of unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilical (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients), headache (deflection), headache, nausea blood (increased spoke-production), saliation (increased spoke-production), fatigue and exhaustion, odetodeficiency, insomnia (sleep problems) and attacking.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the end, the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of agitophrenia and the treatment of a new manian episode in patients who had mostly lack of episodes on the treatment with Arizakethylbenzene, compared to the risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of disturbance and behavioural troubles in patients with biizophrenia or in patients with manian episodes is bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable for the risk of risk.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for placing an event in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is intended for the treatment of constant episodes of bipolar episodes of bipolar denia - and for the prevention of a new manian episode of patients, which had predominantly mansions and other episodes on the treatment with Ariadjole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has been detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, independent of the meals as a monotherapist or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the bigger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialine dose should be considered, if clinical factors are justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor can be removed from the combination therapy, the Ariadjole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicides are one of psychological disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Arizjole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased suicides in patients with Arizprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ariadjole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infectious diseases), cerebrovascular diseases, terms which are used for hypotony (dehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive medicines) or hypertension (including acred and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spodyskinesien: in clinical trials which ran a year or less, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Ariane-rozole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If one with ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of late dyskinesis, should be drawn into consideration the dose may be reduced or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When one patient developed signs and symptoms, that indicate a mns or without an additional fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, Arizjole should be used in patients with clampires in the anamnesis or in states that are used in connection with campires in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Ariadjole in patients treated with psychosis treated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Ariadjole was an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted disintegration events with Arizjole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases is extremely and associated with Ketoantinous coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrens patients and patients with bipolar Manie due to compostbidities, the application of antipsychotics where weight gain is observed, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primitive effect of Ariane-ethylbenzene, the central nervous system is warned when Aripiylbenzene in combination with alcohol or other centrally positioned drugs can be taken as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Arizrozole, but this effect is not relevant to clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Ariadjole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect another high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made with similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolisation, the combined application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ariadjole results in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common application of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY in effect, the potential benefit should not exceed the potential hazards for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore should be made with similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the use of the CYP2D6 or 3A4-inhibitors the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dosages before the beginning of the escort therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilemazem or Escitalopram (or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated using a constant increase of Ariadjolitic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Ariadjole showed no significant effect on Metabolism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dexaggerorphan / 3-Methodius morphine), 2C19 (Omepraole) and 3A4 (Dexaggerorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to alert their doctor if pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ariadjole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data base to ensure safety in human beings and in the reproduction studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential profit justifies the potential hazard for the redus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotica the patients should be warned of driving dangerous machines, including power vehicles to operate, until they are certain that Arizjole has no negative effect on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side-side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ariadjole (25.8%) of EPS including parkincism, acathony and dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Ariadjole treatment and 13,1% in placebo was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients who were treated with Ariadjole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manische periods at bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% amounted to patients under Ariadjole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase, over 26 weeks for a placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Ariadjole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, there was no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Arizroethylbenzene, compared to 2.0% of treated patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In relation to the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptosis syndrome, spigdyskinaries and varicfanless, undesirable undesirable events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or unintentional overdossiations with Ariadjole were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and obscathes.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information about the effectiveness of a domodialysis in the treatment of an overdosage with Ariadjole. however, it is unlikely that Hämealysis has an overdosage of benefits since Arizjole has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Ariadjole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I interruption through the combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptor and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors are conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ariane-ethylbenzene in vitro demonstrated a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptors as well as an affinity to the dopamine D4-, for the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, to the alpha-1-adata, and to the receptor-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Ariadjzole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed the decrees reduction of the binaries of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-Liganden, at Nucleus caudatus and Putames.</seg>

<seg id="78">In a half-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of patients in response was observed in both groups (Arizjole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from the scales that were defined as secondary data potential, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asginal Dep- scale, showed significantly more stronger improvement than Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in the Arial prazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study carried out in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Arizjole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks in reducing symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapytic study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Arizjole showed no superior effectiveness against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, Arizjole showed an excessive effectiveness in week 3 and an maintenance effect that was comparable to the group of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic Rains of the Manie demonstrated like lithium or Haloperidol in week.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a deficiency or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, which also reflected on lithium or Valpros-monotherapist with therapeutic serum, which partially over 2 weeks suffered a superior effectiveness in reducing human symptoms compared to monotherapist with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks prior to Randomisation during a stabilisation phase, Arizjole showed superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar decline, primarily in the prevention of a return in the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxytheaters, the N-Dealkation is described by CYP3A4 catalyzed.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of the mean elimination process is approximately 75 hours for Arizjole for extensive Metabolians about CYP2D6 and for almost 146 hours with 'poor' (= "Poor") metabolisation via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Ariane-ethylbenzene, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in the pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or interaction of pharmacokinetics of Arizjole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripylbenzene and Dehydro-Ariadjole were similar in patients with severe cardiac insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of patients with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of Ariadjole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to pull sisal at their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproduction technology, comotoxicity and canogens potential, preclinical data were no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or positions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so it only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of the dossier (lipofuscine pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats according to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10mg / kg / day) in the recommended maximum dose of female Steady-State-Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a choleliasis was determined as a result of the loss of Sulphylbenzene in the Galle of apes from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) in the recommended dose of clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations in human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, which were determined in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed with dosages that led to expositions of 3- and 11 times of the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended operating maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtum-active ingredient that promotes the compounding of the microtubules from the tubullet indexes and stabilizes the microtubules due to its deolysis.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibiting of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microrotating network, which is essential for vitational interactivity and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transforms of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies proved that the presence of albumin in the transport of Paclitaxel was funded by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transidothelical transport through the gp-60 albuminous transfers is performed and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (hented protein acidic rich in cysteine), a Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-logged studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public. this document is a summary of the European Public Publication Report (EPAR), explained in which the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the carried out in order to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can not be applied in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetic medicine) can be applied together. • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition, metformin patients (especially overweight patients) can be applied in patients with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphate resin or insulin, the existing dose of Sulphylharnoss or insulin is capable of reducing the insulin treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level); this dose should be reduced to the insulin delivery dose or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better tolerated and the blood sugar level falls better, so that type 2 diabetes is better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in triplea was investigated; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphate resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycaylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured as well as the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">It led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which allows to close the blood sugar values by the use of the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the complexes, the effect of an additional gift of acetate to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphate resin in a reduction of HbA1c values increased by 0.94%, while the extra gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin had studied at 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients receiving additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision-problems, infections of the upper respiratory (cold), weight gain and hypothesesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients either in patients who are unable to react to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency (high ketones - acidity level - blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as part of a monotherapist (for the sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients, where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for placing on cars from Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until whitish, round, vaulted and carry on one side the markings "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic heart disease), a decompensated cardiac insufficiency should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose stages.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should follow signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, gain weight gain or eye-depot, especially those with reduced bardialer reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and oil ways when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about cardiac insufficiency, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver data values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of a liver disease, Pioglitazone can not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver data values are again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developed which refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, exhaustive problems, tiredness, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver data values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision if the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the prestance of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosshdependent weight gain was detected, which can stir in fat deposits and in some cases it is connected with a fluid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemorbazone, as a result of the therapy with Pioglitazone, a minimum reduction of medium hemoglobs (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazon in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobs by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lower extent in patients under Sulfonylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobs by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the enhanced insulin-sensitivity was observed in patients who received Pioglitazone as oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulphate-insulin-insulin-dependent insulin-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After a market launch the treatment with thiazoldindian, including Pioglitazon, was reported via an appearance or deterioration of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the appearance of maculaodems, but it should be aware of a macular edema while patients report on interference of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary of messages of undesired events with regard to bone outcomes, randomised, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated structure of the error was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures for women, treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events occurred fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) combined with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if one patient wishes to be pregnancy or who is entering the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical characteristics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenolic and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral counteract, Cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-reducer inhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with the pulmonary (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is primarily due to the treatment with Pioglitazone who reduces hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of breast cancer, thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fötal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Extremely common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (calculated from present information).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the Turgors and the denoting index of the lens, as well as with other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon the three times the upper limit of the standard area were equally commonly referred to as under placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulliylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study of patients with advanced macrovascular disease it was the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon or</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, rare has been reported on cardiac insufficiency with Pioglitazon, but when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or patients with cardiac insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary of messages of undesired events with regard to bone mares from randomised controlled trials were randomised, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the proactive study period of 3,5 years, fractures appeared on 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in people treated with a comparative clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome proliferator) Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which results in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitive of liver, fat and skeleton muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the Glucoseproduction in the liver and the peripheral Glucosmos utilizes in the case of insulin resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapist was carried out more than two years to examine the time until the therapist of therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be investigated by Pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients suffering from Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients, whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months, was randomised to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to those who received insulin-insulin. a reduction of insulin injections in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the album / Kreatinin Quotients compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapyon (monotherapists with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, based on type 2 diabetes in 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction in the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol level as well as slight, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglyzeride and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant increase of the LDL cholesterol was detected, while under Metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon didn't just lower the sober-triglyceride, but also improved, also the postprankings increased triglyceride levels, which also showed a effect on triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiovascular disease, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and advanced macrovascular disease in groups were randomly allocated to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, with the concentration of the concentration of Pioglitazon in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interactions studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical characteristics of Digoxin, Warfarin, PhenproCoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marketed Pioglitazon, the marker was primarily found in the barrel (55%) and to a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination upset time of unchangeable Pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and the total active Metabolite is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but rather resembling the oral clearing of the oral substantive.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, according to repeated plural volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is primarily due to the treatment of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin-resistant insulin-resistant insulin resistance to reduce local growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familiar polyol (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazoldindian resulted in an increased frequency of coloniumni.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white till whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the markings "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated structure of the error was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures for women, treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events occurred fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) combined with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin, with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the album / Kreatinin Quotients compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon didn't just lower the sober-triglyceride, but also improved the postprankings increased triglyceride levels, which also impact on the tryglycerid absorption as well as to the hepatic trygaperid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study comparisons with its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly myocardial syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckels, Coronary Revascularization and Revascularization of the leg arteries that are not associated with taking Pioglitazon no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white till whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the markings "45" and on the other side the wording "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary of messages of undesirable events as regards bone mares from randomized, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years, treated with Pioglitazone and showed an increased incidence of bone mares at women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the Proactive study, a study of 3,5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events occurred fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) combined with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative clinical study.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was able to produce a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is not able to use insulin effective.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycaylized hemoglobin (HbA1c), which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c-Spiegels, pointing out that blood sugar levels were significantly reduced like with another human effect.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients with an allergic reaction (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of Actraphane may possibly be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the complete list is to be found).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S to grant approval for placing on the market of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-insulin-products normally are used once or twice daily when a rapid initiate effect would have desired effect together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be placed under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients, whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensively insulin therapy, hypoglycaemia should have changed measures and should therefore be advised.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin-type (insulin-phase), insulin (insulin-dependent) and / or manufacturing method (caused by recombinant DNA) and / or manufacturing method (caused by recombinant DNA) can result in a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the switch to Actraphane is required to enable a dose adaptation to the patient, this may be necessary during the first dose or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions were reported after a change from animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia was less pronounced than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before voyages that go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to get the advice of his physician, as such trips can be taken and taken up to other times and must be taken with other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">Therefore, the doctor must therefore consider potential interactions in the therapy and always subject his patients to others after others.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immune response therapy and the treatment of transplantation patients should be given to this medicine or make changes in an immunal intensive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this may lead to graft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or supervisitants.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always be the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; adjustment of formulation and the regime should be carried out under the tight control of a physician's transplant control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of the changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of waste and tolerance in individual cases and blood-level control (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After changeover from Prograf to Advagraf the Tacrolimus Talbot should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systematic exposure was measured as an valley level, with both joints and both eyes and transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus Talbot are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant to ensure appropriate substance of exposure in direct transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood tales in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da the renal function does not exercise impact on pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatic mirror, a calculation of the creatinine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent inspections of the Tacrolimus Talbot during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood Talbot from Tacrolimus should also be checked after the changeover from Prograf at Advagraf, Dosisadaptation, changes to immune soup treatment or for the benefit of substances that could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicinal product with a low Clearance, adjustments may need multiple days if the Steady State has occured.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley level of Tacrolimus lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transplantations, in the range from 5 to 20 ng / ml and corseled patients with 10 to 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantation, blood concentrations were taken in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including graft reactions or other adverse events which can occur in a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always be the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; adjustment of formulation and the regime should be carried out under the tight control of a physician's transplant control (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of transplantation in adult heart transplantation and grafts, there are still no clinical data for the retardized formulation of advancement.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions which can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus mirror in blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the dosage of herbal medications contained (hypericum perforated date), or other plant remedy during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in blood has been offered because the Tacrolimus blood levels could be subjected to considerable fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a cardiology hypertrophy was observed in rare cases, which therefore can be observed at Advagraf at Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical problems are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticoeroid, hypertension, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, liquid overloading, and oil.</seg>

<seg id="1530">In the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by lack of factor VIII) is used.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of the application is determined whether in the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention is applied.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from factor VIII, resulting in blood-problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA-technology:"</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by one cell that has been associated with a gene (DNA) that it is capable of formation of the human planting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different product approved in the European Union called Recombinate, similarly, is produced differently, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe up to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood vessels were awarded with "excellent" or "well" rated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of advate (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Surate may not be applied in patients who may not be supersensitive (allergic) against human clotation factor VIII, mouse or Hamor protein, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Baxter AG to grant us an authorization to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of Substitution is based on the severity of factor VIII, according to the location and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in i.e., i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk is passed by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment it is used to control the dose and frequency of injections a reasonable determination of factor VIII-Plasmaspar.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semiconductor problems.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Preprophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor of VIII is not achieved or when bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to reject an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be addressed after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulation activity of factor VIII. IgG Immunoglobine, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma with modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors are correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk is dependent on the most part of the world and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamneural inhibitors was observed, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, re-performed (mear) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare advent of hemophilia A in women are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the largest number of patients treated with ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who have previously untreated advanced risk for the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), non-known (frequency based on the available data).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234) (b). the unexpected decrease of the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels occurred in one patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clots was investigated during the whole time and by the factor VIII- mirror in plasma and the clearing rate showed adequate values at the 15th postoperatively day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe up to moderate hemophilia A (≥ 150 days) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE one low Inhibitors (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, there was none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe up to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) by previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) an FVIII-inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study, 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated patients for inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on footsteps of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak of anti-Cho cell protein, otherwise no signs or symptoms appeared on an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval of available data, the CHMP has continued to be regarded as a positive result, but in effect the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP on the basis of the safety filter by ADVATE, which makes an submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided to apply a further extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited, based on the Committee for Human Use (CHMP), officially announced that the company receives its request for approval by Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, the breast, brain, bones, or female parts (tissue, which links other structures in the body, surrounds and support) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">There is a type of virus that genetically altered so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been changed so it does not produce copies of themselves and thus no infections can solve in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">In addition, an excin would have injected directly into the tumors and enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from non-defectives in the human body of the p53 gene, is usually used for restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study with a patient who came to the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of the subtree, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP support the answers to the questions submitted to him, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the reference of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, this CHMP has not been demonstrated that injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumors have advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also has concerns relating to the processing of pharmaceuticals in the body, type of administration as well as the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not been demonstrated that an excite can be manufactured in a reliable way and that neither for the environment nor for people who are in encode contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP about it, whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered efficiency release" means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective parts are immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours released.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergies (Grasshoppers of the nose) in patients with nasal mucous membranes in patients with nasal mucous membranes (stopped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily is one tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment duration should be as short as possible and terminated, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa skin.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of locating symptoms, which were reported from the patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">While the study carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all rolocating symptoms, the patients reported a decline of symptoms reported by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients who received the Pseudoephedrin only.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal membranes were considered, the patient showed a relief of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who had the desloratadine only.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycarving (cardiac deficiency), asyngitis (Ruisoselessness), constancy, fatigue, Insomnia (insomnia), sleep problems and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) against desloratadrin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adore active ingredients or Loratadins (other drugs for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeronautics may not be used in patients who suffer hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (oversight of thyroid) or already had a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain bleeding) or had a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to grant approval for the market of aeronautics in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however it is in total to swallow (i.e. without them to crush, to break down or cut down).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data for inability and effectiveness (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after slump of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use period to 10 days, because when long-term application the activity of Pseudoephedrin can take time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline in the mucous membranes of the mucous membranes in the upper breath, treatment with desloratadine can be continued as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin, the medicine is also contra-indicated in patients who are treated with a monoaminoidal oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrin with other vasoconstriids, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, eryamine or nasal as an abdicular Rhinoplasty (phenylpropanol, ephedrin, Oxymetazolin, Napalolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and the efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and the efficacy of aeriners were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data is not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the occurrence of hypertension or speedometer, heart rhythms, heart rhythms, nausea or eterior other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or interpains of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups: patients with heart rhythms • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the angiography, diabetes mellitus, bellows or bronze age in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze should deposed at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests as anti-histamines are otherwise positive reactions to prevent skin reaction or to the extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the framework of clinical trials with desloratadine, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinical interactions or changes from Plasmainstation of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychological tests, no significant differences were detected between the desloratadine and who were treated with placebo regardless of whether deslorateth had been taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadadata was not identified, so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inability of the use of aeronautics during pregnancy is not backed with experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to vascular characteristics of Pseudoephedrin should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should however be clarified that in very rare cases, it can lead to severe impairment or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, dimined mental attention, cyanosis, Koma, cardiovascular disease) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, trekking, coax) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, scaffection, muscle growth, heart rhythms, heart rhythms, heart failure, nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, nausea, breathing and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely to do in children, as well as Atropin typical symptoms (oral sickness, pupil rigid and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastic cells / basophile as well as the inhibitors of the adhesion of expression P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine has no effect on standard measuring sizes of flight performance including the amplification of subjective strokes or the tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, there were no increased frequency of strokes in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily when compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage may cause further likable imetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachkkarate or manifestations of a ZNS control.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1.248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergies containing 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonist effectiveness of aerobic tablets, determined by the total of at least for the symptom (except of nocous membranes), significantly higher than under a monster with Pseudoephedrin over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aeronautics tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucuous membranes, was significantly higher than under a monster with Desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aeronautics tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study to pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrin in day 10 was reached.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dossier that was conducted using formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects, four subjects of Desloratadin was badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components of interaction shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) from Pseudoephedrin after the sole gift of pseudoephedrin biodiesel was the exposure to the gift of a aerobine tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, on toxicity in repetitive gift, for comotoxicity and reproduction, preclinical data with desloratadine did not know any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as their individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the content of Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive tumor studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrin was administered in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 the regulatory filing system was established and works before and during the product on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms, by preventing the histamine, its own substance, its effect can unfold.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets lenses that occur in connection with seasonal allergies (locating) occur, such as nies, running or juckling nose and trendor or juckling eyes at the same constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children from six to eleven years the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal Rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to verify that the body makes the syrup, solution the solution for adjusting and melting tablet in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of symptoms (symptom number) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies of Urtikaria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks treatment with Aerial 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, lauchadin, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to grant approval from Aerius to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with a or without a meal, to linking symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of Desloratadine during children aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous illness and may terminate and resumed after taking the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), patients can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were detected at clinical trials with desloratadine tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, Aerius and alcohol is not enhanced the performance of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should however be clarified that it can be assumed in very rare cases that can lead to impairment of traffic or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in several indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported in placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth driest (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most frequent tripains had been treated with 5.9% of the patients treated with loratadine and 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple clinical trial study, up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine-times clinical dose) were observed, no clinically important effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as the inhibitors of the adhesion of expression P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the framework of a clinical study involving multiple outlets, in the desloratadine a dose of up to 20 mg. daily was administered over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the ninety of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc-interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">For a single dossh- study with adults, Desloratadine has no effect on standard measuring sizes of flight performance including the amplification of subjective strokes or the tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius was effective in case of symptoms like nies, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrium and rocking of the eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the total of the questionnaire in Rhino-Imtivitis, Aerius effectively decreased its burden of allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria has been representative of further forms of the urticaria, since the underlying Pathophysiology is irrelevant at different forms and can be recruited as chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine release is expected that Desloratadine is expected, except for chronic idiopathic uria, besides chronic idiopathic uria too, in other forms of urtikaria to an improvement of symptoms. this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of puritus and the amount of paddling at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of Jewish population by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients who were treated with placebo patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax, as measured by a 4-point rating for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study in which patients-deographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergies of Rhinitis -population, a higher concentration of Desloratadine was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no maintenance points for clinical-relevant Kumulation once a daily application of Desloratadine (5 to 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, that for Metabolism of Desloratadadin enzyme was not yet identified, so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine inhibits in vivo active not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier with desloratadine a dose of 7.5 mg taken meals (greasy, calorie rich breakfast) do not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out by Desloratadine and Loratadine showed a comparative degree of exposure of Desloratadine, no quality or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity of Desloratadine and from Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, comotoxicity and reproduction, preclinical data with desloratadin cannot recognize any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains Lactose-Monohydrat, anchocolote 400, Indigo 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless movie (contains Hywil 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to prevent the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are submitted to support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of angiography, physical examination and related laboratory studies should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">In about 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years, desloratadine is metabolized and experienced a higher medium-load operating load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolic, is identical to those with children who metabolized normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with heredal problems of a fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose absorption or a saccharac disease insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were detected at clinical trials with Aerial tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, Aerius tablets and alcohol is not enhanced the performance of alcohol content (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The threading of the side-effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar at the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in several indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, have reported 3% more adverse reactions in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multidose study of adults and adolescents, where up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine-times clinical dose) were observed, no clinically important effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years old, who came for one antihistamine treatment in question, received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadine are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadine may be extrapolated in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which Desloratadine was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg. daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc-interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of strokes in comparison to placebo was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In single daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets caused by adults and adolescents in clinical trials in no impairment of psychotoric.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinically-pharmacological studies in adults, it came neither by the simultaneous consumption of alcohol nor to amplification of alcohol-induced power consumption to an increase in speed.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in linking symptoms such as nies, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and rocking of eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As indicated on the total of the total time of questionnaire in Rhino-Imtivitis, Aerius tablets was effectively affected by seasonal allergies due to seasonal allergies</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. were officially admitted to the Committee for Human Use (CHMP), and the company receives its application on approval for the preperation of aviaries H5N1-influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov was to be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against the flu, caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that could cause a trunk of influenza that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of flu virus is gedified, which can easily spread from human beings, because human beings still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">According to the vaccination of the vaccine, the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine contained in the influenza virus as "physical alien."</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a position to create a contact with a flu virus of that genms faster antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "Surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a body-foreign), are cleaned and considered a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not enough to meet the requirements of guidelines for the EMEA (EMEA) guidelines.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years associated with the immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1) which has caused the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow up the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution for inclusion, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the security of this combination was not explored.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked, which has taken antiviral medicines at the patient before, and the probability is judged that the virus will appeal to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase is reduced by taking in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS do not cure or healing the damage of the immune system, thus creating the development of AIDS bandages and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which were previously untreated with protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Medicinal Medicinal Medicinal Medicinal Medicinal Medicinal product was compared with 206 adults who had taken earlier protease inhibitor, compared with other proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (Virusload) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with those who had previously received no proteins, had taken more patients with viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, but with the children that had been treated with protease of death, only very few were addressed to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated with protease inhibitor, the virusload increased its viral load after 16-week treatment as well as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV that was resistant against four other proteins, it came together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks, compared to the patient who continued its existing protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase should not be applied in patients who may potentially be supernatural (allergic) against ddetavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase should not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression) or medicinal products, the same as Agenera, are supposed to be taken in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the Agenase are taken, the risk of a lipodystrophy (alterations in the distribution of body fat), an osteochondroid (absence of bone tissue) or a immunoreactivating syndromes (symptoms of an infection that are caused by the resulting immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenase in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines prescribed for treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is generally taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers Ritonavir, but the Committee established that the benefit of Agenal in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have no protease inhibitor is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" since the date of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to the Glaxo Group Limited to grant approval from Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">In combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protein inhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ambbr should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bio availability of amblown avir as a solution to take up is 14% less than by amblown avir as capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and a solution for inclusion on one milligrams per milligrams of base is not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Aprase capsules is 600 mg of amblown br twice daily with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules can be applied without the addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses are applied to Aimase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Aprase capsules is 20 mg of Amdetavir / kg of bodyweight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily average of 2400 mg of amblown, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteins were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for insolvency and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose to Agenase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function increases to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The concurrent application should be used in patients with light or moderate liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and additionally represent the substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Iso enzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>

<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluxason or other gluten-corticoids, which can be confused by CYP3A4, is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment systemic correlated effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the triguerenfunction (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the reduction of the HMG Coa-Reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly recommended by CYP3A4 and Simvastatin due to increased risk of myopias including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the international conformance ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of the concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective for reduced plasma levels of amidavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the ability to metabolic interactions with ambavir its effectiveness of hormonal contrast can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given simultaneously with amblown avir, the patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatentymph nod, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir in particular.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of a toxicity according to the high propylene glycol solution, this formulation is indexed in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution at certain other patient groups.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial equisology is assumed (including an application of Korticoeroid, alcohol consumption, heavy bodyweight, higher body Mass-index), cases of osteonekeepers were reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenase should not possess at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the cytochrome P450-Iso enzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with Ritonavir can not be used together with medicines that are mainly confused with medicines that are mainly associated with CYP2D6 which are predominantly associated with serious and / or vivid side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin has caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir which can lead to a virological result and can lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the lowest plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were very frequently unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum perforated) The serum levels of ambavir can be abased by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already incorporated Johanniskraut, the amidavirus and, if possible, check the Virusload and add the cursor of the Johanniskraut.</seg>

<seg id="1966">Up to 508% increased, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amidavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amblown br were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and insights of this treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="1968">In combination with calabra (750 mg twice daily) occurs in combination with caletra (400 mg of Lopinviolr + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of ambavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination with amblown br (600 mg of Lopinviolr + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are administered approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amblown br (600 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study on the application of Agenase in combination with didanosene, but is suggested due to the antechariosenic component of didanosene that the revenues of Didan in and Agenase are at least one hour (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ambavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adaption is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with ventures in combination with ambbr and Saquinviolr is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be one.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitor and existing data can be avoided that Nevirapin may potentially reduce the serum concentration of Amperfavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used simultaneously, be careful because Delavirdin was less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is applied together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made because a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of Amdetavir and Ritonavir is difficult to use Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The concurrent administration of Amperfavir and Riyutin led to an increase in Plasmainstation (AUC) by Riyutin at 193% and thus an increase in associated adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, ripputin together with adgenerase are advised to a reduction of the dose of rift in at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with Erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma concentration of both medicines could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>

<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below are including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4 if they are used together with Aprase, possibly interactions to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are related to these medicines when they are used in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitor, antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The concurrent application of Anticonvulva, known as enzymes are known (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with Ambavir can lead to a lower plasma torsion of amplbbr.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium blocks such as amlodipin, diodipine, neodipine, neodipine, nbodipin, nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by amblown up, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of Agenase can considerably increase the plasma concentration and increases with PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotation, vision disorders and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study conducted in Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 μg of Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily), the Fluticasonpropionate plasma protein rose by approximately 86% (90% reduction interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the concurrent gift of Aprong with Ritonavir is not recommended to do with these Glucose coids, unless the potential benefit of treatment systemic coticoereroding effects exited (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-Coa-Reductase inhibitors like Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose processing is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, increased increases of plasma levels when compared to Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma resistance of these HMG Coa-reductase inhibitors can lead to Myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabilization of mirrors as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus may be increased in the same time as amidavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">In addition, Agenase can not be used together with oral lordzoleic acid (see section 4.3), while the application of Agenase comes with parentric Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteous Midazolam with other proteins inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If Methadone is given up with ambblown, the patient should therefore be monitored on Opiatenteplomas, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir in particular.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, currently no recommendation can be given, such as the amidavir- dose is given when Amdetavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In case of simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenase, a reinforced control of INR (international normalization ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of impregnation or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal counteract is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous administration of Agenase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may be used during pregnancy only after a careful extraction of possible uses for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the foetus.</seg>

<seg id="2003">The insolvency of Agenase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the Agenase treatment associated with side-side effects were slightly up to moderate, rising early in early and led them rare for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events is not clarify whether it is related to the ingestion of Aprase or another simultaneously to HIV treatment, or whether they are a sequence of lung disease.</seg>

<seg id="2028">Phenotypical data interpretation analysis based in the genotypic analysis systems can be applied in connection with the genotypical data on the estimation of the activity of Amdetavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor insulating isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (Separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of the resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amblown avir associated genetically creates a certain crossresistant against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>

<seg id="2033">The reverse reserves the ambavir to isolate its activity against some other protein-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and of the type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders that can influence on the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover is based on the efficacy of Apra in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, together with Ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidy analysts (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily with lowest Ritonavir.

<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty (n = 163) patients with a proven virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least one another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the research study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir in relation to the period-adjusted average change from the output value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sublegenic wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of untreated Agenase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Aprase's solution was administered three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of patients treated with Agenerase administered NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients included in the study included plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered as expected benefit of "involuntooster" Agenerase, who should be considered as expected.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Following oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">At a level of 508%, the Cmax should be reduced by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amblown br (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amdetavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amdetavir 12 hours to the dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and allows an unstable penetration of ambavir from the blood circulation in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active in plasma, with the amount of unbounded ambblown, which remains unchanged, probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unspoiled ddetavir remains constant, the percentage of free active shares in the Steady state concentration during Steady-State during the period of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals, CYP3A4 induce or inhibing or a substrate of CYP3A4 which are given to be given at the same time, if they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amdetavir exposure such as adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is a solution of 14% less bioveravailable as taken from the capsules; therefore, Agenase solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on one millionth base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the impact of a renal disorder affects the elimination of amplbavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amblown-plasma proteins that are comparable to healthy volunteers with a dose of 1200 mg Amdetavir twice daily without concurrent administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carbblown into mice and rats, in male animals, hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocytes hepatocyst, according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg Amdetavir, languages.</seg>

<seg id="2057">From this study data on humans, both from clinical trials, as well as from therapeutic use, however, some hints for the assumption of a clinical relevance of this findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames test), mouse-lymphoma test, microcore test on human peripheral lymphocytes included, was amblown neither dirty nor genotoxically.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical use due to measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenase nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity at young, treated as from an age of 4 days showed both the controls and with amblown up-treated animals a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">At a systematic source exposition that was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymuselongation and minor skeleton changes were observed that point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules can be applied without the addition of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses must be applied (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Aprase capsules is 20 mg of Amdetavir / kg of bodyweight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily average of 2400 mg of amblown, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The concurrent application should be used in patients with low or light liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause severe or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the international conformance ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of the concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenase should be set to duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systematic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk for a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with pharmaceutical-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated with associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin has caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir which can lead to a virological result and can lead to a resistance development.</seg>

<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency is not determined, and for those patients, no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">In patients with Aldurazyme, patients can develop infallible reactions that are defined as each in connection, which occurs during the infusion of infusion or until the end of the infusion of infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients still should also be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be made only in a reasonable clinical environment, where reorganizing facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies to Laronidase are generally accepted, generally within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients, the antibodies or symptoms of infusions are to be treated with caution must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience in the resumption of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretical risk of a hypersensitivity to a interruption of treatment, caution must be cautious.</seg>

<seg id="2303">As no result of newborns, which were exponically exposed over the milk above the breast milk, it is recommended to not-quiet during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse reactions in clinical trials were classified mainly as infusions in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medicine activities related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and of an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years, frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS I-related involvement of the upper respiratory system and lungs beside the pre-history, severe reactions occurred, including bronze, breathable and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, were reported in the table with greater heavier form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most cases the treatment occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a serum-version, whereby it was mostly given for patients at the age of 5 (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to an early departure from the study) in 13 / 45 patients were not detectable by radioimmunohimitation (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients who never came to Serconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-physical mirrors were a robust reduction in the GAG spiegels in Harn while in patients with high anti-antibody titers to be able to determine a variable decrease of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) demonstrated a marginal to low-neutralizing effect on the enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to be associated with the incidence of adverse drugs, even if the incidence of unwanted drugs are typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate processing.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After an intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly taken from circulation and cells into the Lysosomes, most likely via Mannosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the entire pathological spectrum was recruited, the majority of the patients were observed from the mid-phenotype and only one patient showed the heavy phenomotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had an expcised expirational volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change in the FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for a further 3,5 years (182 weeks) every week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyma were treated with an improvement of lung function and the ability to prove that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme Group, as out of the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the percentage of the FEV is not significantly higher than that period of clinical and absolute pulmonial volumes increased proportionally to a height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients treated with a Hepatomic alie before treatment 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear trend for the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine) was determined that remained constant until the study programme.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to the heterogeneous illness of patients suffering from combined endpoints, clinically significant changes between the patients (6%), the course of shoulder straps (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A single-year-old Phase 2 study was conducted, where the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied at 20 patients, who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the heavy vertical form and 4 with the middle course type).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased GAG- mirror in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) demonstrated after the Z-Score for those age group (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle-run form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with severe evaporating form only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapy, the heavy trigger for nausea and vomiting (as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of alxi can be increased by the additional gift of an Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as anti-emetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group does not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevented the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapy, the heavy trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with alxi showed no vomiting (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with alxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetron these values were 63% for alxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission announced the European Commission of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a permit for the placing on the market of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: prevention of evacuated nausea and vomiting in heavily emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer treatment and vomiting in moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alxi regarding prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a Corticosteroids by adding one prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon, patients with an amnesty or indication of a subacute Ileus should be monitored according to injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful with the benefit of Palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is prolonged or extending to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">But in connection with any other chemotherapeutics gift, Aloxi should neither be used in days after chemotherapy nor to treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials inhibited Palonosetron against tumours of the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloak, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-static concentration of metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancy are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women because it is considered necessary by the treated physician than necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe side effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least probably stood with alxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Objects (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity and reactions at the administration site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-focused experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar buildings showed unwanted events of adverse events such as in other dosing groups; there were no dose of action to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out because of the large distribution volume, a dialysis however probably did not have any effective therapy at a Aloxi- excess.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies, a total of 1.132 patients were treated with a ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg of Ondansetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasason.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, received 32 mg of Ondansetron, received intravenously on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderate-class chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogencies are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the relevant effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionary channels and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of i.v. abbreviated Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial elimination of plasma concentration from the body with an average terminal-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg for patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After an intravenous administration of Palonosetron, 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 hoary carcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase of Palonosetron plasma torial at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of pharmacokinetic simulations, that at once daily an intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached a total value of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax after the one-off of 0.75 mg higher was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolic which have less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for Metabolism, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, CYP3A2 and CYP1A2, which occur at Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, palm oil than unaltered ingredient made about 40% given the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After an injection intravenous injection, the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Indeed, in patients with severe liver function, the terminal elimination and average systematic exposure has been increased with Palonosetron, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate above the maximum human exposure, which indicates a minor relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence that Palonosetron may only block in very high levels of iconduces, which are involved in ventricular deformation and replication.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded over two years, resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumor, endocrine neoplascimen (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, epidiermark) and skin tumors with rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and as Aloxi working for one-time application, the relevance of this results is low as for mankind.</seg>

<seg id="2661">This means, Alpheon has been using an organic medicine called Roferon-A with the same practitioner, which is supposed to be approved in the EU (also called "Reference case").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a lasting liver disease).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue injury also shows the values of the liver enzymes Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood norm.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast which resulted in a gene that stimulates a gene (DNA) in which it stimulates the formation of the material.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon published data, which prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (efficiencies, composition and purity of pharmaceuticals, efficiency, security and effectiveness of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns demanded that the data on the stability of the drug and the marketed drugs have not been sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was again kindled against more patients than in reference to reference, Alpheon has more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test carried out in the study to study the question, to what extent the drug forms a immune response (i.e., the body is antibodies - against the medicinal product), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be used for the treatment of imetigo (a crust-infection) and small inficated infirmary (tear or slicing), amortization and piles wounds can be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not used to treat infections which have been detectable or probably by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because burgo against this kind of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the skin surface must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should investigate patients once again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by block the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the bacteria's growth.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main Indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was denied after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin samples, altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of patients showed on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, altargo was detected at the treatment of ginal (hollow shafts in the body tissue) or infections which have been detectable, or probably by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse events with altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the principal point.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo in short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infiring, devisor or piled wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission granted marketing authorization to the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit to be granted by Altargo into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be considered to be considered and an alternative effect can be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensizing or serious local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is thrown carefully, the ointment carefully selected and an adequate alternative treatment of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections, in which MRSA is known or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary operations, the efficacy of retinamulin was caused by retinamulin in patients with infections, caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is considered to be considered, if a 2 or 3-day treatment does not enter any improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and concurrent application of other topographic products is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Based on the low plasma concentration, which were obtained after topical use in a preheated skin or surface area, a clinical-relevant inhibitor has not been expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the same period of two times daily, 200 mg of Ketoconazole increased the mid-dose Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on sloped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to its low systematic exposure after topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not necessary, when topical retapamulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 for inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a precintoxicity according to oral ingestion and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fötal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the use of Retapamulin was able to prevent the application of a systematic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In case of decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with altargo continued / terminated, is between the benefit of the nursing for the infant and benefit from the altargo therapy to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections which applied Altargo, the most frequently reported triritation by appointment, which was about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect of the retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated due to fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly picurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein syntheses due to a particular connectorsion of the 50s base unit of the bacterial ribosom which differs from the bonds of other ribosomal interact anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Please indicate that the binding section ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P-bonds and the Peptide-transferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this binder, Pleuromutiline to the Peptide transfer, some P-bonds interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosom subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Shouldn't appear on the reason of the local prevalence of the resistance to Retapamulin at least some infectious diseases, an advice should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retinamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-appealing to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulants (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was taken daily under occlusion on intact and lowered skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary-infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma proteins were captured.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The rehearsal was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording on humans after topical use of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 with diced skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinamulin in human liver microsomes was pressed primarily by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid problems.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro testing on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microcore for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither in male nor female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in order to achieve up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest exposure of human beings (topical application on 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were determined at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development tools (reduced body weight) and materale toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market has to ensure that a pharmacovigility system, as in Module 1.8.1 is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product market is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for placing on the market is obliged to perform in further detailed studies and additional pharmacovulation activities, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Crossine on Risk Management Systems for" unuse products for human use ", the updated RMP will be submitted to the next periodic safety update Report simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated point, you should stop the application of altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salads, creams or lotions on the surface that is treated with altargo if it has not been prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It cannot be used in the eyes, on the mouth or in the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment of Descries on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your physician to advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After carrying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterilised bandage or a Gazelle tape, unless your doctor will come to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in a aluminium tube with a plastic cap, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of salts, or in a Aluminium bag, which contains 0.5 g of anointing oil.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver with children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immovable against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied in the context of one of two doses of existing vaccine, with which the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix allows only to be used whenever the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccination can be carried out from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a check-out dose is required against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine is given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines may work by increasing the immune system (the natural body of the body), "as a disease can defend itself.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produced antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the individual vaccination of Twinrix adults and the vaccination vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of one of three doses of existing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of imminated children who had developed a month after the final injection of protective antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">The Ambirix starts between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injections to the development of protective antibodies against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was with a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, appetite, pain, vitality (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">The Ambirix must react to patients who are possibly supersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients that react to any other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologys.a. a permit to be granted to the market of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The dimming dimming plan for the ground dimming with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given by the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a check-out is required for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with appropriate vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C anti-hepatitis C surface and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibody-anti-virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully secured whether immunorementioned persons, which are addressed to a hepatitis - vaccination, as they may also be protected against the immunologic memory because of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As in all injections of injectors, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction according to the gift of the vaccine, corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the stand-dimming scheme is recommended to produce 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hematalysis patients and persons with interference in the immune system, no incentive anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antivitreous could be achieved in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration may result in the gluteal muscles to an optimal impulses should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases, Ambirix can be injected as an exception subcutaneous subcutaneous in these cases, as having intramuscular relationship with bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injections at the same time with a combined Diphtherior, tetanus-, acellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus Cyra-Röttle vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immundefective therapy or in patients suffering from immundefective, no adequate immune response must be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccines of these formulations in adults was the frequency of pain, rounding, vibration, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable with frequency that was observed in the previous thiomeranian and preservative vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies 2029 vaccines Ambirix were administered at a total of 1027 imports at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants from the age of 12 to and including 15 years the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combined combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions was the higher number of pain and materity at a calculation basis per vaccination Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination simulated.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects were given to Ambirix, over pain, compared with 63.8% of the subjects which had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The incidence of matism was compared per profiling (i.e. above the total vaccination cycle at 39,6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in the subjects which received the 3 doses of combination simulated).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and delity was low and comparable to the administration of combination simulated with the 3-cans of vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds, the appearance of local reactions and general actions occurred in the ambirixgroup comparable to those with the 3-cans combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6--11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common appearance of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not reported per profiling, is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of impregnated impacts on severe side effects during the 2-doses of vaccination with ambirix or during the 3-cans-vaccination with hepatitis C virus and 10 µg of combinable Hepatitis B Surface antigen reported, was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out in imports at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the serum rates of anti-HAV 99.1% were given a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum levels of anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to including 15-year-olds, there were two doses of Ambirix and 147 the standard combinants with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289, whose immunity was trained, the seroprotors were significantly higher (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3-dose impotency significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response shown in a clinical trial study at 1-11-year-olds would be reached after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, imports were either a 2-doses of vaccination with ambirix or a 3-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg of combined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies confirmed at least 24 months after the immunisation of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies in 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunity reaction observed in this study was comparable to that of vaccination of 3 cans with a combination simulation, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS anti-antibodies are comparable to the 0-6 months vaccination opening at 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix starts in the second year at the same time with the request of a combined Diphtherior, tetanus-, acellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis-vaccines (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined mascara-möttle-vaccines used, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with three doses of the present formulation was performed in adults, showed similar seroprotors and serum levels such as previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both to examine and / or physically visible changes in case of resellers on any part of the source code and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis C virus is usually transmitted by viral-based foodstuffs and beverages, but may also be transferred by other ways, such as bathing in through water-contaminated waters.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, a dark urine, a passes face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms, possibly a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not be fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infill / your child before the administration of both vaccines Ambirix are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child should not feel unwell or ill / feel) a vaccine could possibly prevent a vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that inflict liver foxes or symptoms which are similar to those with hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be derived by juckende of skin, respiratory, or scaffections of the face or tongue. if you have a allergic reaction on an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a serious infection with a fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the conventions of the second vaccine dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">For a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B in the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it is recommended to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine, with reduced content to effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination against vaccination of vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix starts with persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders, under the skin and not in muscle tissues. • If you are weakened by a disease or treatment in your / her body's own defense, or if you / your child moves on a hermalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction on vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you receive any further medicines / register (including those who have been vaccinated without enrolment) or if you have been given / your child recently / or Immunoglobuline (antibodies) have been given / or who is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine, and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate digits and as possible as possible different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix must be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction on the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually Ambirix pregnant or lactating women should not be given, except it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor when using your child or your child once a allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known since the approval of the first authorization for placing on the market, CHMP has shown that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, Ambirix was only transferred to a Member State in the Netherlands since May 2003) and is limited to the available safety data for this medicine based on small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonites can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with incomplete endefective enzyme or hyperammontic stenitic suscephalopathy (Hirnicious due to high ammonium concentration).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonites is divided - split up to several single doses to meals - to be swallowed under the food or via a Gastbell bar (included in the stomach-leading hose) or a noensity (with the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonopoly in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle is beneficial to high ammonium values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonites was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients with which a complete enzyme could already be manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a delayed form (complete enzyme defective, who is manifested after the first life of life) there is an indication for the use when the amanism exists a hyperammonic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, suitable for infants, who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sutching disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in Granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium polyphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day, with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early physical deficiency of Carbamylphosphate phosphatyl cellulose, the substitution of Citylin or Arginine is needed in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetic deficiency have to get Arginine in a dosage of 0.4 to 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with sillary disorders, as there is a risk for the emergence of Ösophagulzera if the tablets are not immediately going to the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mmol (2.7 mmol) of sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with Sodium and ecominating clinical states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolisation and elimination of sodium phenylbutyrat exceeds the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is indexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous administration of phenylaculate on young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal impulsion and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">A delayed maturation of shredded synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and therewith a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacim is left out of humans in breast milk, and this is why the use of AMMONAPS is contindexed during the breastfeeding period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these unwanted events had assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anovic patient in conjunction with Laktatazioth, heavier hypothesemia, manzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The case of an overdose occurred in a 5 month old small child with an accidental single dose of 10 grams (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacacetate, which showed an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day for dossiblotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacc is a metabolic compound, compliant with glutamine by glutamine into phenylacetylglutamine, made through the kidneys excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically seen is comparable with urea (both connections contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the loss of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruption of the ureter cycle can be assumed that for each gram of sodium polyphenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early, and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infist, and the disease itself led to treatment with Peritonedialysis and essential amino acids, with their sticked analysts in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By Hemodialysis, the use of alternative means of nitrate pollution (sodium polyphenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newly born in postpartal (however, within the first living) diagnostic illiterated diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients suffering from mental disabilities or other neurological deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a delayed form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of the Ornithinly parrot bamylase deficiency), treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Even existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylactic acetate, which is produced in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, being produced in phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to an individual dose of 5 g. of sodium polyphenylbutyrat in sober healthy adult and in patients with liver cirrhosis, according to individual and repetitive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and Metabolite was also examined at cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium polyphenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat in tablets form 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycles or hemoglobin retinopathy, after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable by a phenylacic acid in plasma by the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentration was five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The loss of medicine is excreted within 24 hours of about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate were treated with toxic and non-toxic effects (investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either orally taken by orally (infants and children, who may not swallow any tablets, or patients with sling problems) or via an inn.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day, with a body weight over 20 kg and with child-growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early physical deficiency of Carbamylphosphate phosphatyl cellulose, the substitution of Citylin or Arginine is needed in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium polyphenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were subjected to the birth of phenylactic acetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), there came into lesions in the pyramid of Hirnrens.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anovic patient in conjunction with Laktatazioth, heavier hypothesemia, manzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically seen is similar to phenylacetylglutamine using urea (both connections contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier on the loss of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations about the separation of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruption of the urinary cycle, the sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Even existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate in granular form, 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrate were found.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this approach the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient need to receive a probe above a probe, AMMONAPS may be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium polyphenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare cases, certain liver enzymes, such that they are unable to exert proteins in the body for consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are conducted laboratory studies, you need to tell the doctor that you can take AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacies if you have taken other drugs or recently taken if it is not prescription medicinal medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding time, you cannot take AMMONAPS, because the medicine could survive the breast milk and your baby could harm.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, pain-problems, descendure, disintertibility, reminder, and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you determine one of these symptoms, use immediately with your doctor or with the notification of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment in combination.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute Koronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood sugar to the heart), for example in unstable nina (a form of pain in the chest corps with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebdo" (an anomal measured value of electrocardiac or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who are subjected to a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion may be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angioxa-IIb / IIIa-Inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a buckle, and they received also other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">For the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI for the prevention of new events (deaths, heart incidents or Revascularization) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients that were subjected to a PCI, Angioxin relation to all indicators did as Heparin, except for serious bleeding, with which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may potentially be supersensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudine, other miludine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who had recently sent a bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin treatment with a PCI and a PCI option.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company of Medicines Company UK Ltd to grant approval for authorisation from Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (instabile Angina / non- ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency handle or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initiating dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous pin of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If another PCI is carried out in the case of the patient, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion in the intervention can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusions increased from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of a initiated intravenous bolts of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a dose of 1,75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a certain Bolus-Gabe of Angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended, even if a short PCI encroachment is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes) to below 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg body weight should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of low ACT, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before applying the application and given the Bolusdose rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">If the ACT value exceeds more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), that one PCI should be undergo (whether treated with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower idle rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg should be applied and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney stones, which resulted in the phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which led to the approval, the ACT received 5 minutes after the administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without any dose adaptation at an average rate of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, injected the upper arm or the upper arm or administered as a continuous discharge with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to control of glucose (sugar) in the blood or non-insulin-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin pulisin distinguishes itself very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter duration has as a short-effective human effect.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was included in the application in combination with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce an insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">For type 2 diabetes, non-effective diabetes, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the amendment to the concentration of substance glycaylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% to insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are possibly over-sensitive (allergic) against insulin or one of the other constituents, or in patients who have already suffer hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may possibly be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can effect on the glutide.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sankoi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to grant approval for the market traffic of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal ceiling, the thigh, or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal product.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced happiness capacity and diminished insulin production, the insulin need for patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of impact strength, the brand (Heron Steller), the insulin-delayed, etc.), the kind of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method can move to a change of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or the termination of a treatment, particularly in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic Ketoazide; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin delivery should take place under stringent supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The effects of hypoglycaemia depends on the impact profile of the insulin, and therefore it can change while switching the treatment schemes.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemia, include oral antidiabetic, dispersion-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyphins, Propoxyphins, salicylates, and Sulfonamid antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetles such as loosens, clonidine, Guanidine, Guanethidin and reserves the symptoms of admired counterpoint would be or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reagents showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and Humanity in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether the insulin is overthrown into the human breast milk but generally occurs in the breast milk either in the breast milk. however, it is resorated after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are the clinical trials that are listed below are listed, grouped according to system operations (exceeding 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the basis of available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - welding, cool and blame skin, tiredness, nervousness or tret, anxiety, confusion, concentration problems, sickness, excessive dog, changes of vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to switch the injection site within the injection range, in a consequence, a lipodystrophy may occur in the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemics with consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is treated by a doctor, or by intravenous administration.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose-injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the original cause of hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially through Skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that at subcutaneous alledorms of insulin is becoming faster and the efficiency is shorter than hu- manem normal chlorine.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years old with type 1 diabetes, insulin-relevant doses of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg demonstrated a proportional to a proportional gluing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glueing effect, exactly as Humanitarian.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin injusions has twice the fast impact of normal human lives and achieves the full guru effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that an application of insulin injunisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postoperative glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal chlorine, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was insulin-tulsed in 2 minutes before meal, and better postpranal control than with human normal chlorine, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If the insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is reached, as with human normal chlorine, which is given 2 rutors before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin injures in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given as compared to human normal chlorine, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-insulin-free gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN: after the onset of meal in comparison with human Nor- malines, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
