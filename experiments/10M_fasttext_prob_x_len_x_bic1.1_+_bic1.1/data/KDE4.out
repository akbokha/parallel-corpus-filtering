modern digital cameras distinguish themselves through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be realized as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use to connection the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug , the program g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 is using digital cameras supporting digital cameras supporting a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras supporting . g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a wide @-@ wide protocol that supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to host and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general files are slow and transfers via the serial port are slowly . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports this cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 camera outputs . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 . if the EX@@ IF support could not be available , or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things , &amp; digi@@ ous , is , how easy can expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ a . aim is to provide the modules of all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate images in almost every way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; own .

what is a digital evaluation management - beyond the fashion word ? digital evaluation management exam@@ ines each part of the process after the picture has been taken until the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos can be sc@@ anned , sc@@ anned or digital photos , however , does not make a form of digital data management . but most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips for you to back up , find and use photos again . in this way we are concentr@@ ating on the procedures for digital photographs taken &amp; digi@@ ous ; We are looking for downloading , dup@@ lic@@ ate , evaluate , optim@@ ise , optim@@ ise , waiting and export image files .
&amp; quot ; digital data management particip@@ ates on inde@@ xed , categorized , se@@ eks , transformed , transformed , transformed and exported content that has a mon@@ et@@ eres or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are certified according to your definition data that provide information on or to provide documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not to know how many photos you don &apos;t need &amp; digi@@ ous ; . the approach to save both in a database and in the image files can be guaranteed very fast search and secure archi@@ ving on you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first you need to do and know before you have to enter any of your system structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must have to be arranged on your computer if you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc ; make sure you need to change onto a bigger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your storage location . if you are plenty of photos on the same place . if you are plenty of photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a web page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be organ@@ ise to organ@@ ise your content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the split of file types makes stack@@ ing processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store met@@ ad@@ ata into &amp; digi@@ ous ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget , then you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by clicking the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? add &amp; digi@@ ous ; add a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now start the real work , as you should select every photo sign , labels , and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that will require the same attri@@ bute and then set the value . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos at the same time .
let &apos;s go with key@@ boards , keywords , how to proceed with other programs frequent , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import the catal@@ og@@ ed images from a different source with embedded key@@ boards , then add &amp; digi@@ ous ; automatically add the images to the correct place . setting up the hier@@ archy within the building is no problem and can simply be done by the drag of a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed phr@@ ases came from &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while they are tra@@ cked away .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very large representation , because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the words - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to watch most ni@@ es your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to interested in your photos .
check out this panorama . from afar off is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the landing site of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream with associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even listen to the silence of this panoramic position .
for other photos , the title is probably more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . if you should show a story , it is the meaning of the viewer to help Him beyond the motive you understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can also save as much text , in an international@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even create a sp@@ ell ch@@ ecker . if you export your pictures in web galleries , these labels will be able to tell you about the label and / or the title of web @-@ gallery . you need to tell the story so for the opening of a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before goo@@ gle Earth ? good , because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation now with light speed .
the possibilities are using the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can simply repeat that you can open your vo@@ ort by using images with geographical details . you can also download the photos at the recording location . you can also download the pictures by using Google Earth , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . can you export your Google Earth viewer .
Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on distribution and changing of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for working others .
the following description tells you that the information should be stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ous ; as information , the information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for cre@@ ators and Writ@@ er ) : this field should add your name or the name of the photographer , for example to protect the name of the photographer , such as the name of the photographer , then it cannot be changed . this field does not support com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a partition .
aut@@ ol@@ itel ( Syn@@ onym for Writ@@ ers Line ) : linked with the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples for this , photographer , freel@@ anc@@ er photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onymous for suppliers ) : do not use the provider button to identify which the photo will be . if the photographer is working here for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , then you can download the image here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the image will be displayed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against mis@@ use . anyone has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can be delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water characters . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in one picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the near future , a module for stack@@ ing processing is available .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs you lost on the streets or fire . these kind of losses are the same those who can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
&apos;@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data @-@ recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated and you can &apos;t go longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers of Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that would have a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your pe@@ eling space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices , and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest properties , but you are much reliable , but you can select the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors , even if you have just written only . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they need for chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust and etc ;
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster &apos;s apparently works on CDs and Linux , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the format of the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything is said of course also for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good admission device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . also , if you should place the media using a description , date &amp; author license and thereafter at a clean , dark dry and before animals protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can interpre@@ t these media .
your statistics for itself . your manufacturers guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study about trouble shooting of hard drives : dis@@ missing the disks
shortly : Dis@@ ks will hold the longest fault rate in the temperature range between 35 ° C and 45 ° C. The fault rate can not determine the most frequent error correction , SM@@ ART can not notice these errors immediately . these are especially readers and publ@@ ishers . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you saved the files , but these losses are usually able to restore any large problems .
while most electric devices accum@@ ulates not much , these can take heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed process . these can cause severe damage , hardware alter@@ ations , hardware reports and other defects . thus protecting mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves from in@@ ev@@ itable that causes a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is a part of the energy saving is absorbed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . but remember that any plug @-@ in bar contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it satis@@ fies the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also ensure that he protects protection against lightning .
since an over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should also ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage support for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed especially for Not@@ eb@@ ooks , and therefore also contain the protection of the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while the over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the current lines it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of indisp@@ ens@@ able data . therefore it can be meaning@@ ful to invest in a continuous power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltages , these tools can automatically be able to save and run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should even be sure that they are the same quality standards such as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential haz@@ ards which your computer system is exposed and compare its safety in current distur@@ b@@ ance with the costs to avoid this . a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euros ; this is just a small price difference if you think about your calcul@@ ator . finally , you should always think all cables to tr@@ enne before you come to the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offering which allows you to store any amount of data .
but they are in comparison to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you must send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more at your disposal , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality only .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission error can be automatically adjusted in accordance with the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer , and therefore they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ful .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are due to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs constitute at least the data integrity between the operating system and the disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if it happened in your hardware . all of these problems remain un@@ distur@@ bed until you have no protection in your hardware . it &apos;s pretty anno@@ ying that it should not be thought of that . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably secure data way than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses , as they generate Inter@@ e@@ fer@@ encing within the stream stream . in normal file systems this error remains un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not especially affected by transfers , you should look into the future . for 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scalable as well . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it &apos;s soon available for &amp; Linux , and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanism the z@@ fs used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
these two factors are under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss at the notebook and 46 % at work bench systems . when not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most masters . it leads to a lower damage as such as theft or re@@ installations . but it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know quite a few viruses and under &amp; lin@@ ux ; it has been no longer sigh@@ ted .
open Source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the widespread file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation into a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely stored before the problem happened , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat for digital data : false , theft , and human error , are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rough@@ ness character@@ ise for all types of light sensors are far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ate . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you will be no longer affected for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and try this backup before using anything to do something like the re@@ installation of your operating system , sharing records , or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you would have luck when the drive was not connected to the moment .
a des@@ aster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do not forget flight accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or whole house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ pre@@ vent@@ ation is always a non @-@ store storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite securing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and is a complete copy at a time .
difference protection : backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete mom@@ entary snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last difference backup .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time again . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that is only ab@@ dic@@ ated and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool which allows you to easily setup your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ mitting scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens and if you would like to increase safety about ss@@ h .
secure online images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you get a full daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly monthly message for at least one month and a monthly message for each month . every further examination should be done manually after which you have done a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the picture file stored IP@@ TC files , associ@@ ating X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the internet .
so valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the period where you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies you should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you must watch everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to come back to the current system . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask oneself like the current system back@@ ward . if less varieties you have used in the past , it is easier to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of declar@@ ations in this document . use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization , today is available for everyone . if you have an old system , so that reading your pictures you will store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you can change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or change your file format , if necessary to convert your library and if necessary to a newer standard . keep open standards .
scal@@ ability is to change its scal@@ ability for the possibility of changing a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
let us assume that you have put scal@@ ability with the area and you want to enlarge it on a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and lay them to a new record :
check out the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them .
/ dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; b ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; b ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ed ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; mp4 / cor@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is able to read more , you can create these yourself . this task will become easier by year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG was developed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can now have a lot of administration information but not as many as TIFF needs . this format is recommended to save your images .
TIFF was widespread use as image format . TIFF can store images in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm . a problem is however necessary to store your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital neg@@ atives file format is a license @-@ free and open raw file format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon as well .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . this is an important characteristic technology that allows users to enter into a file itself . file information is stored with extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored the XML / R@@ DF file .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to arch@@ ate it in front of your photo , mostly in the file format . X@@ MP makes it possible to put the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the file format and the picture file would come to . therefore you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and lay all there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI lies the work on a architecture and modeling , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standard and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images are on the camera @-@ frame , you can use them as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw materials . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a host@@ ile processing , you can use external programs . if you come back with &amp; digi@@ plug , you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut at any circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed images for cop@@ y@@ righ@@ tly with a digital water@@ mark . export it then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , you can use in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; add a description on how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive , but you can add many advanced settings to import@@ ing images to your night@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; use this using the computer , turn off the camera on display mode and switch on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect to your camera . when the connection is made , an Fer@@ tig indicator will appear at the lower end and the preview photos of all photos on the camera will display . some cameras are displayed , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of file instruction are displayed for any file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to any entry . with the aff@@ ord features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a details and met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo@@ information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer . note that with some digital cameras not all information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata illustrates the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s classification , GPS etc . these information is the same as in the Met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then choose from all . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you select the photos , select the button selected and then selection Selected . the button selected is as long as long as you have selected some photos .
when your camera supports this , another option is available for download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; however , in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance window . if you select this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you want to download all buttons or choose from selected buttons , a dialog appears where you can choose the target album . the list of existing albums is sorted , displayed in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug , the photos of the camera will be loaded into the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , when you want to delete the button . if you want to delete a few , then you must select this first and then delete Del@@ ete .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos taken from the camera , they will not be deleted . so you should be sure that the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ album can be downloaded completely , before you want to delete them from camera . if you want to delete a camera , this is much faster than that .
cameras do not use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos used as fil@@ en@@ ames . fil@@ en@@ ames will normally be rev@@ oked after the photos taken from the camera . this can be used to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you have taken photos of different asc@@ ents to the same album . therefore , it can be sen@@ sible , the date and time when the image has been taken into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ ver@@ bs . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transmission will open three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding items are copied from the EX@@ IF data to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use other date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for more adjustments you should read the command full time .
if you are using the camera file names , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case , or in upper@@ case when you prefer this .
the new file name , used &amp; digi@@ ous ; for a photo it is used below the name , which provides the camera in preview . your settings can be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; may use all information on the orientation of the camera to hold a automatic rotation during the approach . not all the cameras are ready . in the section of page Met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera into the photo .
automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera does not deliver these information , you can turn off &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photo in the original orientation . if you turn off the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
when your camera was made information about the date , which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ ous came ; this sub@@ lime is based on the picture data . all the cameras are based on the same album . all the cameras are available on the same album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ section . not all the cameras are embedded in the picture page Meta Data . you can read them about your camera in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to set this option . use the button Advanced , and select the option for the bottom @-@ based sub@@ lime at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is the button download . select file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are up@@ loaded . you can also choose more than a file containing the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the pictures are loaded high . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in length and lat@@ itude and can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses an aircraft to handle an area due to automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forget later , where exactly the photo was done , you can only open a browser that shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous post ; users who want to loc@@ alize the place of the photos , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to connect the position data of a photos .
the question is how does the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are some of them working together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel , but you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format , because this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude grade or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by P@@ hil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of adher@@ ents to e.g. from m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .

&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to determine which data types &amp; digi@@ came ; indicate , you can select the file extensions of this list and convert any file in any &amp; digi@@ ous ; alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no of these extensions is added to &amp; digi@@ ous ; igno@@ red .
the default settings can be reset you back by pressing the button to the right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can then be set on this page . however , if you then open the spot@@ ted table , these settings are not available . option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size of lad@@ le quot ; should you only have on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , the image processing is used a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch it here . you can switch the tool bar , if you use the im@@ aging in full screen mode .
over@@ - and lower areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this picture can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the immediate declaration .
with the setup PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . thus means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TIFF files you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF pictures . this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm .
with setting up @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can store any loss free . even if you have written the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the image processing was only a viewer viewer for photos . currently , it was developed very quickly to a tool to manip@@ ulate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard resolution is that all green pixels are equal to more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixel error in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the image a bit sof@@ ter but the 2x@@ 2 gr@@ ate pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used like the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance uses .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white card which was shot in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that lower images will get in four steps more details in the top lights . this option will be igno@@ red this option .
the default , it is the top , so the parts of your images are used , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top lights , as it shows the top lights in various ros@@ em@@ ones . finally , you can try to re@@ constru@@ ct some parts of the missing information from plants .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ constru@@ ct the lack of green and red shares of not yet satisfied blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you re@@ constru@@ ct the option , you will get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put him somewhat higher than standard 1 . but this may also be done later into the picture options defined &amp; digi@@ ous ; - im@@ aging the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be con@@ serv@@ atively able .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data , which will have many cameras and also known as a matrix colored pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w introduce you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it was produced as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm of D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you &apos;re looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is surely the best method for a paint correction , since you will be carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as these should be given . there are also LC@@ MS and digi@@ ous ; information as the color information from a colour space in the others are to be translated as exactly as possible .
behavior Issu@@ es when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
colour profile folder S@@ ing here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; check out the folder while the start .
settings of the ICC Profile you have the option &amp; quot ; standard supply ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management screen is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ yll . here are only your images rendered color does not manage the whole screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model you need . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some examples such as Canon , which does not contain any color mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ de- . currently correc@@ ts d@@ cra@@ w Gamma not for conver@@ sions at 16 bits depth . this means that you need to perform the ink mapping itself .
there are further options like the soft @-@ pro@@ mo @-@ profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors as well . this might be correct manually , rather than to fl@@ ashing the algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is fairly obvious that colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug@@ in Interface . it is an interface supporting a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing is supported ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of the available modules . if you are using &amp; digi@@ ous ; this module will appear as new entries in the menu window and beyond that you can see also in the context menu of the table .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can set a short shift in the menu under Settings .
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project via ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ in@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ ash@@ board should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust@@ s the time between the images , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the met@@ ad@@ ata a or , which ends at the bottom end of the images during the ad .
the camera features indicate a list of all the cameras supported on the left hand side . on the right @-@ hand side a button automatic detection , which is connected to the computer . if you want to use this camera , you make sure that the camera is properly connected , and in the image mode . currently , the port settings are currently supported here , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can rely on the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have selected a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ saving storage camera from the camera . you have to indicate the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / h@@ ull , specify when you hang your camera .
to use &amp; digi@@ plug in order to use your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer to display and switch in display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and manually , after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the menu of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can enter all here .
with the option dialog for shi@@ fting from &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album . in the sections of a photos and del@@ etion of an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down &amp; digi@@ ous ; when you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback , otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also use the welcome to the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; it also accelerates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ous in circumstances .
the attitude at the start of new photos are forced to search &amp; digi@@ ous , the base folder was deleted from &amp; digi@@ ous . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the starting time of &amp; digi@@ ous . if something came from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you know if it is to delete them from the database .
different colour schem@@ es can be found in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can select below the design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be recorded at the bottom :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you will find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; it contains a fast image processing with some base tools . you can use it to preview your photos and for correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry No .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; therefore , you are not part of your distribution . additional information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be setup in section image processing .
a status parts at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the upper edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the editing functions of im@@ aging change your photos . however , no of the functions will change the original photo before you have used to save the tool@@ bar file . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
you should be able to finish a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save as a file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re@@ produce the original image by rest@@ oring the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have carried out on the photo since the last deposit .
almost any action of the im@@ aging can be revers@@ ed or re@@ produced . the last action can be revers@@ ed automatically by using Be@@ ing Rest@@ oration or Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you often use this , you should get the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for revers@@ ing and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you receive the &amp; L@@ MB button on the back common or re@@ produce button in the tool@@ bar a moment you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entry , all the actions are also re@@ produced between or recovered .
once you started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation use in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can come in the photo , and zoom out in the p@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . when you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . if you don &apos;t want to display this tool bar . if you don &apos;t like this , you can call this from the &amp; digi@@ ous window dialog ; you can open it from the &amp; digi@@ ous window . see the section for setting the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the menu file and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole phr@@ ases . all image detail shots can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and from the menu album Export Printer assist@@ ent . if you follow the assistant , you will need to make your choice .
the main window has a side panel on the right edge to provide important information and actions for the selected image . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation bar , also available in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar and disappear again into the edge .
in the labelling screen , you can enter the label with unlimited size or insert it . note , the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed to be copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters are truncated and special characters are coated . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you commented on it , use either the button application or change easily to the next image that will then be stored .
in addition to the user button , there is a button more . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . however , this is always done if you select a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that will always be written into the pictures .
the section evaluation shows an assessment ema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and s@@ orting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the keyboard ab@@ brevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select this out and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field emergency . the coding is as follows in the following table :
the key@@ ing view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ words , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; meeting of the stit@@ ch .
the key@@ word is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the given search phr@@ ase . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of options in search of a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief at the input of stit@@ ching in a picture series . if you have entered various key@@ words , these are saved for fast access .
keywords can also be placed through markings of the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all the keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , If you want to have a choice with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the pi@@ ping filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . typically , the left side bar will be used with their album , fil@@ um@@ - , Key@@ word and search views . if in addition one or more key@@ word filter will be used on the right . all the keywords will be available . all the keywords are available .
you can also draw tags , and place . if you have chosen several images to be provided with key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and place on the selection . then , a dialog appears if you want to place the key@@ word .
in the above example , the main window depic@@ ts the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords that put the amount to three pictures . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards a key@@ word from the right key@@ word has drawn away and placed there . a dialogue asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . it can also be switched on under Settings .
if you have a rule with and real@@ ise that it would have to be or to have it , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is sought . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , keywords , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string which is already set up in the database .
you can select a Advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ed options , do not need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adjusted to &amp; digi@@ ous ; s concrete implementation was adjusted .
the reason why one distingu@@ ishes the colours known from your camera or scanner is an predic@@ table deviation of the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colour @-@ managed workflow you can reach the colors on your camera or sc@@ anners , or the colors that you create or in the web , which correspond to them from your digital dark chamber .
if the topic is on color administration , then everyone wants to press what buttons need to press for the results which he would like . unfortunately , this tutorial is to give you adequate information about color management systems . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to make your own inform@@ al decisions to meet the required results .
if your image work@@ flows are met all of the criteria listed below , you must not take care of color management .
you will work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the RGB colour space ( see below )
your only other educational expend@@ itures are by e @-@ mail or web where the RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if the RGB works well and makes life for all that simple , why should you use another color space and do thoughts on colour assets ?
a visual example of limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ che region , and the colours in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimension@@ ally representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , check this page here and then click info and then on information about RGB working sp@@ aces .
do I have to break my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the RGB colour space or not , you have to work your monitor , since s@@ RGB mer@@ ges the circle . if you are working as a color space of RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the RGB standard , either a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . use it therefore before you try a further manual editing .
the functions Normal@@ izing , identical , automatic and contrast expand from the menu , automatic correction will automatically try out of your colours to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects , to see which works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the leu@@ k@@ able values about the entire picture , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ady . this function is often an ergonomic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced .
same : this method adjust@@ s the ampli@@ fication of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity can be as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results achieved at the improvement of the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it .
automatic weight : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright lim@@ it@@ ones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue can@@ als on the entire hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ acy range .
contrast enh@@ ances : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the one of the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible range and a re @-@ loss of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white wine @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the White @-@ equal correction is somewhat limited to an color space with 8 bits per color . if you can perform from the original image , you can perform areas with over@@ exposure . if you can perform the White @-@ like in the pipe mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will be better correct .
this tool is based on a white ano@@ int algorithm of the copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ma . they launch it on the menu entry colours white @-@ equal to im@@ aging .
the preview window can be adapted in size . on the left @-@ hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original box , then it &apos;s enough to click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos includes a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels is displayed very small g@@ umin@@ escent values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed .
the contrast of your earnings depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows allows you to improve or down the shadow details of your photos or also down di@@ mm@@ ing .
note with the above mentioned checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of white balance . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white sample with the list of def@@ aults . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed aggregate increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . this will display the combined result in white balance . this will be displayed in a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image .
buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set to save in a text file and later load it later .
the button settings sets all filter values back on its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . please note that neutral settings can be shown a different picture as your original . if you want to save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the code depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding is needed and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under color key correction . this tool provides an integrated path available to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always take the same error . in the manual for the key correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to determine that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool color effects presents four color effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , an ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ter filter available .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ato , an effect of which was developed when one partially developed printing a short flash , and afterwards the development of the image has been revers@@ ed . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is created , that &apos;s not to create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is ( 1 ) and the applied intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a saturation so that it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . this is a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrast . the characteristics of the choice for natural photographs . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some photo stories , especially those who are hardly any landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameters level controls the brightness of the results and the shift repet@@ itions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . at large images , the filters can over@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to change the color con@@ sign@@ ment and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors . once you are satisfied with the result please use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
in case you can make a photo of bad light conditions , you can also get a good choice for brightness / saturation . even in this case the tool is able to increase the saturation instead of saturation . all changes you can do in preview if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma , the tool is based on the correction of the exposure . even if the dialog has been complicated for this tool , you need only the range of shooting . specifically the three shooting beneath the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s , three sli@@ p@@ ants can be cli@@ cked into the inside and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the kno@@ b and change it on how the image changes .
on the right @-@ hand side the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : using this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y @-@ axis can be used . in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top of the dark sounds , the middle for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three paint pin p@@ aces can be set in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow , medium and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ bs which can be used to evaluate the output values , for example , to create an un@@ easy picture as a background , while something else can be seen in the background .
automatically : using this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image .
save and store : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and later loaded . this Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color p@@ aces , the input values are automatically adjusted to all shades , medium and sun tones . click the preview of the original image to set the displayed values of the Hist@@ o@@ Programme for Rot@@ or , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ can@@ als .
the over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ e@@ dic@@ ator option controlled all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and correct picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side , half of the origin@@ als and the target screen will be displayed , depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel of the module :
in addition to this boxes there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . most of the linear mode is the most meaning@@ fully . for pictures with large areas of constant colour the linear mode is generated by a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps further .
for example , if you move a c@@ vent@@ ar to the right , i.e. the brigh@@ ter sounds , then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dark sayings and the corresponding image pixel can be dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you display this marking on the area you want to change a right line on the curve , set the original value . create a point on this line and move it up until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . every curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three color@@ ings -@@ buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want and click the original image to set control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ e@@ dic@@ ator option controlled all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black and white image that was corrected in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ weg . shadow and sun tones were applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu @-@ channel mixer of the image processing .
with the duct selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note that you can correct the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window displays you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you place this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appear to give you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are below the right below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allows you to keep these channels . if you also enable the option to convert mon@@ och@@ rome , because the channel mixer is then convenient to generate the creation of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color to a visible noise that occurs from far@@ brau@@ schen . if that of the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion to improve the colour@@ ing first .
the Save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be stored for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ bel@@ i@@ cht@@ e@@ dic@@ ator option controlled all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photograph in which the blue channel is re@@ adjusted . the option of lumin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is Black / White a step , since color images can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

with &amp; digi@@ plug . tool : applying this tool you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless if it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the bul@@ ls of an old master , a Pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or as a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the certificate of the depth and three @-@ dimensional chain of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool frame can add a decorative frame around a picture .
to keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a picture it is not easy task . a possibility to keep his attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing the eye . under the frame the module can be started using the image processing .
type : with this parameter set you select the desired frame type for your image . immediately the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , painted it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a pop and decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this with decorative target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of pictures , especially when you have used the tool at page ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text in a picture at any place . this also goes to several locations if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . if you need to adjust the character size of image size . the larger the picture , the bigger the character set must be . finally , select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed .
with &amp; standoffs digi@@ ous ; tool en@@ cil , you can create a sten@@ cil over a picture .
the menu Picture Tem@@ plates can be used in im@@ aging , for templates over a picture .
for the template there is no restrictions regarding size and orientation . you must , however , if you want to add the PNG file format . if you want to add your template &apos;s file size . if you like to add your templates &amp; digi@@ ; templates , simply send an email to the &amp; digi@@ ous ; ma@@ iling list digi@@ come @-@ Users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the templates for the next start .
after the root folder for the templates has been set to a design view that reflects the signature of the template folder . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this kno@@ b increases the representation image . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button resi@@ zed the underlying picture . if you want to remove the mouse in size . if you want to remove the template on the whole picture , you need to sc@@ ure the image according to the left mouse button .
move : use this kno@@ b to post@@ p@@ one this one under the template . then take the image and insert it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your picture . the picture will then be adapted in automatic size .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; presents three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but it produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works at the contrast of the edges to see a picture . indeed , it works rather intelligence . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Chang .
reproduction is possibly the best of the three because he really improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus and most digit@@ ised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this means that sharp edges are slightly wounded when using color points . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras do usually need more often sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for home users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has been used in internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images on rough @-@ size must always be suspended during processing .
some sc@@ anners apply a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the picture . if you de@@ activate this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo of the shar@@ pen@@ ing . that can be correct with the menu entry .
however , this should be careful of course , since the results are not very natural : shar@@ pen@@ ing the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can reach the tool tab for shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture . under editing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution that adjust the image to a bit sof@@ ter . use the tool to adjust soft@@ ness with the menu entry , and experim@@ enting with the settings on the right side of the dialog button shows the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can see here .
the original picture and preview can help to edit the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be able to ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the im@@ shar@@ per mask , you will create noise and the impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius represents a number of pixels on each side of a edge by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore get more images at the best in their final resolution .
the amount makes the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture of the original is added , thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fra@@ ction of the maximum RGB value and the use of difference . it can thus be used for an edge of filter . in this way , areas are excluded for an edge of the filters and therefore , areas with a soft switch between the tones above and therefore beauty treatments are avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp edges was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous tool was set and focused on a picture by improving the edge . it used to be protected by the copyright protected area @-@ based filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to get a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ fo@@ res@@ si@@ en@@ quot ; this is better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing images . this is using a technique called F@@ IR nese fil@@ tering . it is possible to use a sharp@@ ness mask . reproduction can usually start better results than im@@ bl@@ ur@@ red . you can start it out from the menu by pressing a button in the image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding has a very long tail , depending on the original size of Vienna , the F@@ IR nese In@@ verse the Gau@@ ge &apos; is even very strongly influenced by remote pixels . caused by far un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value when your image is extremely bl@@ ur@@ red but should be careful to Heiligen@@ sch@@ a .
correlation : a correlation of correlation can be used to reduce Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation was reduced to the mod@@ ulation effect of the module .
volume filter : an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . an useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still left to pollution .
caution : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos; h@@ edge . in most cases you should avoid this value to 0 . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you have a value un@@ equal to 0 , you might also increase the correlation between and / or the spo@@ iled filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . a increase of the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module will be very slowly when you choose to select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stores as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any reproduction parameters will set you set to be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform any trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately , but they left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , use &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by preventing a greater neighborhood used as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it must still be bl@@ ur@@ red . even under optimal conditions it can never be seen the effect of infin@@ ity . for the Vien@@ nese filters you can always show the result of the F@@ IR nese Fil@@ ters always at least as well as the Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR nese filter is often better when machining small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ clear colour image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to un@@ sufficient light for the Auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the method of shar@@ pen@@ ing , in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the controller Gl@@ ue has the sharp@@ ness of the dark , in order to generate a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour tin@@ te enables the modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired arti@@ facts with an unprecedented level .
the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are recorded at the bottom :
if you like to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and details . a value of 0.9 should be found so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be subsequently necessary . please note that the details can always be subject to the problem .
direction @-@ sensitive alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ ed evenly into all directions , while a value is near to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ined or a high value of a similar pattern . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be best solved at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor via al@@ im@@ . p then define the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is equal to larger structures . the higher this value is required , the more is needed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : returns to how often the algorithm is going through . normally you will find 1 or 2 .
angle control here &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , then it should also generate small angles for a long term . you should therefore select this value as possible and for your needs .
integ@@ rative stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ rative stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never more than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More of quality that you get through selecting this option is only low . he doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend it .
buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later loaded again .
image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast when working . however , it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button uph@@ e@@ aval .
below you can see how to remove image errors with little arti@@ facts . the module is produced on a photo that caused by a analog black arti@@ fact in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad movie position during the trip , the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous volume came ; a very powerful tool to reduce image changes . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Peter H@@ alls .
this tool provides selected image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , such as dust and hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ ms ; -@@ effects of inj@@ ected images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about configur@@ ing digital cameras , you can read this tutorial into English in this tutorial .
the screen picture above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ windows details and the lower window settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter size per pixel and can be spo@@ iled by the radius , the image and the color in him will be sm@@ ooth@@ ed and so that smaller bugs will be adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ing . this value sets the pixel distance between the filters to the front . if it is lifted to re@@ ject this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details cannot receive greater and noise or dirt .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too hard , the whole noise can be removed or smoke can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings can not be controlled to the smoo@@ thing process which will be controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings can not be controlled to the smoo@@ thing process which will be controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas , which typically are stronger . it doesn &apos;t poll@@ uted the shadow ranges .
damp@@ ing : the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted up , the edges appear to appear . if it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear on the edges . it can remove so@@ cks and is the recommended method for it .
to save and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the room output that you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how to change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and correct with ( 2 ) and the volume reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes it is a picture to cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw a bit sof@@ ter , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen drawing with the menu entry , and experim@@ enting with the menu entry on the right side of the dialog button shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous cup ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo file management .
this filter for rest@@ or@@ ations gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts . it is well adapted to immer@@ se Gau@@ ge &apos;s noise , film gra@@ ins , krat@@ om , compression acts and local errors that occurs in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ ised pictures . the smoo@@ thing occurs along the image con@@ tours and therefore ob@@ tains the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the text is developed with another tool , the error correction , performed . the algorithm to the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ con@@ ia and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it is even very far away . as a los@@ s@@ led compression algorithm he creates a few compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact @-@ quot ; - small standards which are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast on the job . however , it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore termin@@ ate the calculation during any time .
below you can reduce how a photo with equal space is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct figure below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the sc@@ anners and the photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug . tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove Hot@@ pixels of photos taken with a CCD camera , eight to be removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem especially in high quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression via a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel positions ; and &quot; quot ; light pixel positions ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture Sub@@ traction method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button Dark Picture . this tool can be seen automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
when you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark photo to the correct image . a automatic processing of the dark images will find the bad pixels . be aware that the assistant shows the last dark picture and will re@@ load this automatically at the next session .
the image and preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ conception .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ inc@@ ision : it is determined on average of the neighbor@@ hoods where the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ectives in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel within the block .
cube : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less is moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a def@@ ective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ mentation , i.e. , under@@ exposed corners , to correct a picture .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not exceed the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shaded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor . teleph@@ oto lenses shown this behavior .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at aperture filters , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should , even with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ changeable effects through movement arise .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and colour and grey sc@@ anners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter that is used without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction will be working with a Cent@@ er@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or by a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree of compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and Gamma @-@ settings : the work of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is reduced the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the regul@@ ators make you only positive values as you need to increase the settings .
if you want to remove a fine new adjustment of the target image , then release the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma @-@ zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture . a Leu@@ ch@@ imp@@ ke@@ - and contrast correction was also performed on the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Lin@@ ear distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of David Hod@@ son .
this tool is working with geomet@@ ric distortion . color@@ less distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second grain deals with the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and may correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the picture .
the coefficient of the third gradient has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ ed to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ b correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second ridge . if you combine this two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , tons of tons can be corrected and positive values of friction @-@ shaped distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the gradient . this value acts further to the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners argument has the emblem of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads a correction first degree through . negative values can be enlarged while positive the image .
bright : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values improve it .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the data log@@ ging with a preview the distortion error correction . the values you are stored for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the tons or c@@ is@@ o@@ idal correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . in case you can trim this correction as all first . if you have a new picture and then a tonn@@ age @-@ shaped correction would be the effect immediately of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot . following the connection , you can correct the lines with the help of lines .
if you correct a c@@ is@@ cent distortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove them with the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu transform@@ able from the image processing or via the zoom kno@@ b of this dialog .
for most pictures the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some mot@@ ives as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is so to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . please note that if you have a camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the gene @-@ shaped correction on a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infr@@ a @-@ red film of mit@@ ig@@ gur@@ u.@@ org , which is att@@ ain@@ able under this URL . filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can choose the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters adjust film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of the green ( chlor@@ oph@@ yll in nature ) . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter can@@ als for re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information are missing .
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ ming in a landscape photo made of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a way A@@ ura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug Filter Panel is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your images . this is known by classical high @-@ speed filters like the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to enhance the manufacturers big silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the actor monitoring effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems into the past . the treated image will get rid of your daily life . if you like this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ce@@ ful view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins , although larger values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 if you still need more gra@@ ins , so you can apply the filter back several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ ding effect on a black / white image . the original image is ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the oil painting creates oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a high @-@ level algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous filter ; filters oil paintings are a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two controllers in effect to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the pin@@ sel@@ size between one and five . thick brushes are better for large pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the smooth or , from the other side , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the paper is marked with ( 2 ) . pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoo@@ ther 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal dust . the lines that are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you could imagine what scene you could have chosen to sc@@ oop out . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two control kno@@ b with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b elec@@ ts the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( gluten ) .
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter engraving the image in 3 @-@ D when it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure , where colour is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default settings .
this is an example of engraving Filter stages . the original ( 1 ) and the working image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
using this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork using distortion effect . it uses the copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image in cells and can be seen as if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time for calcul@@ ating and generate a high CPU load . you can termin@@ ate this effects anytime with the button .
using this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of im@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses the copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom S@@ sharp@@ ness : understand the image along the glob@@ ular lines that eman@@ ates from a center . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ ale im@@ sharp@@ ness : getting the picture by rotating the pixels by rotating the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a turning camera .
distance : p@@ oo@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera se . the object seems to come back in the background .
movement of motion : caught the picture by horizontal movement of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train to photograph@@ ing camera .
soft@@ ness : p@@ oo@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the brigh@@ ter pots . this produces photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and sub@@ tle bulb .
sh@@ ook : p@@ oo@@ red the image by random placement of pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ sharp@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and get caught these without the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time for calcul@@ ating and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore termin@@ ate this calculation during any time .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make control drops on your picture . in this way it gives you natural your paintings . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n @-@ protected algorithm .
the size of the trop@@ ics allows to change the size of the trop@@ ics . since the sample size does not automatically increase the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . fish branches changes the visual effect of the drops on the picture .
you can start with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; im@@ aging a range free from rain@@ drops . do not use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you start the filter det@@ drops , the area will remain open from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photograph has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . you will find the tools in the menu transform@@ ations and mirrors spi@@ res .
this is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to be smaller . the big question is , how can you zoom a picture , and how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of the resolution can be found here or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , make it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the size with the tool size . choose the transform@@ able size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is visible below .
the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow @-@ up .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split lines inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ous ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the Reiter New size and are recorded at the bottom :
keep the aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is equal to larger structures . the higher this value is required , the more is necessary , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and charging are exactly used . each st@@ all@@ ying for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later loaded .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast on what makes it , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can termin@@ ate the calculation during any time .
you can see below an example of photo shoot by taking a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication by comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse and move the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while using the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the field of the photos will be cut out . as a result , you will get a good overview as your photo after the cutting . you can move the size of the remote zone by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle by moving it with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cut section The button @-@ button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or file Save In menu file to save the newly made photo .
in the preview window , you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in portrait format the greater value of the height and in the landscape is always assigned .
the tool diag@@ onally cutting aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you use centi@@ metres , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to set automatically horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialogue you can use the Max . proportion button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation , set .
the tool diag@@ onally diag@@ onally and keeps its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are reading the cut tool , these settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are recovered the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the inter@@ change aid may help themselves , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third floor , harmon@@ ic triangles are an option to divide a rectangle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangles on the diagonal .
golden Center : the golden middle is a division that looks to different natural growth sm@@ ells , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus con@@ el or the bl@@ ossom of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we find as nice .
the golden partition is the error rati@@ onal number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the old Egyptians and Greeks , that are using your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artist and architect made the golden pitch in all times when you build up your images , buildings and even photographs to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the standing part is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center represents smoo@@ ther support lines , if you have a painting . these help are recorded at the bottom :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third floor @-@ hed@@ geho@@ gs , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral design and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold @-@ corner . it should be something that the eye is moving into the centre of composition . this can be a line that it can be simply because without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles are also derived from the above discussed golden spiral . its ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , gold triangles have no equ@@ is@@ cli@@ cked triangles . diagonal lines can be placed on these lines .
if you are using golden triangles in order to break your frame , create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information into the triple . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and sc@@ aling can be reflected in harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button Color , you can set the color of aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . on this type you can adjust the color of the lines on your actual picture .
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to adjust the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a painting in which the things are turned around a angle . you can use this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; re@@ working and adjust the tool free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der can be set in degrees . with the button settings you can reset the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will appear on the right .
for your help , the module Free Rotation can be positioned a horizontal and vertical line . after you move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to move the two lines . now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will un@@ wanted three angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to cut the function cut off from the im@@ aging .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic . choose one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing select the picture a bit after the turn . but notice the ob@@ taining warning .
all per@@ formers will be performed around a fixation of the so called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will be updated automatically . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog you will find some information which you can help you :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angles in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle at degrees in the upper right corner of the transformed zone .
angle to the left : shows the current angles in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle at degrees in the lower right corner of the transformed zone .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is reduced slightly . for individual adjustment is this effect small but two adjustments produce a double strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you rest@@ art@@ ed the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a possibility to adjust this is the picture with transform@@ ations of cutting from the image processing .
the tool is used to move one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted . with other words , a rectangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers@@ .
touch your picture by using the Horizont@@ al angle and the vertical corners . you can adjust horizontal and vertically at the same time . if you are pressing the settings , the angle will be displayed to zero . a preview of the target will be displayed on the right from the preview window .
to help you get a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the refin@@ ement , the image will be slightly le@@ gible . for a single shot this effect is mostly neg@@ le@@ cted , but two shades is created twice as much heavier and so you should avoid this .
after pressing the image , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate these is the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , by the way how these libraries were comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous .
due to this dependence of other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system . but they will always be JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ come ; displays only files in formats to the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the expansion is listed in the list , this list is added to the file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ ous ; it will change further information in the configuration .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedure on digital pictures . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s is also stored under the same compression ratio .
if you want to learn more about the raw file format , you can read at Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw size images in JPEG or TIFF with the rough @-@ image converter from &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the section configuration you will find further information about the usage of modules with &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supported the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of cru@@ de formats used by &amp; digi@@ ous ;
many digital cameras supporting short films . these clips are often stored in the Avi@@ - or MPEG format ; but if you click on a movie file , and therefore it comes without any built @-@ in movies . &amp; digi@@ ous ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to launch the program to launch the program .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four alignment entries with the white module .
many tools you need to install photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools like shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , rough@@ ness , reproduction , im@@ aging , bl@@ ur@@ gently , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture @-@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . in the left of it five buttons allow the comparative mode of the preview window to change . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected pre@@ ferences .
horizont@@ ally , excluding Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper range shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pre@@ ferences .
vertically divide the left area indicates the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original , and the lower part is the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview window and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be switched on to show over@@ - and exposure of exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setting face .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from preview . you can extract this frame with the mouse within the picture and look forward to the part of the image , from which you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower right corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all the adjustment of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar characteristics shows the essential information on the selected image and is largely un@@ explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the main parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ Program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move up a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires your pictures G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets . application can be used to edit colour pall@@ ets and can be selected and ren@@ ame colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and hot user defined color and ad@@ ver@@ ed colors .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of the installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet screen as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the color next to the colour . the colour is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a colour to move the cur@@ sor position . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor under the button color is added , the color is inserted either by the colour panel on cur@@ sor position . the color is either inserted either or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode can be selected . you can select the check box below the cur@@ sor position below .
a selection which has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and an optional colour name , followed by a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende character , if there are three num@@ eric values in the clip@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colors in the pallet and the output of the color selection can be pulled with the mouse .
choose a colour somewhere on the screen and then you can find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; graphic programs are used in science , particularly in computer science . so far , there were no modern &amp; GUI , including programs , which include &amp; graphical ; - or t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ project has set itself the goal of replacing those programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program to replace .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . &amp; graph@@ s ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :

another required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window shows the open graphics , each in its own window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screenshot . in this case the tool bar contains only the icon file and open ( empty ) list . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screenshot :
as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if the Graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this list or select this position automatically .
use the mouse bike ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you see the maximum reduction of a graph@@ s .
when the software is located in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; can your decision also be igno@@ red , so that later you can change your decision later , you can use the menu settings : graphical ... use , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ically outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or to charge the en@@ ching graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice , but should also change the setup dialog .
when program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice for both and later .
you can also define how the Graph will be split into several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely selected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s that are mounted on a page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the particular parts of the graph@@ s .
page view with one on several sides , distributed without head@@ line and with another font
the site Er@@ ne@@ ut Char@@ ging is the possibility of setting up a file on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set up a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the site open the possibility to define the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphic ; define when a graph outside of a current session is opened . you can open the default behavior in a new window or define it in a window ( in the current session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the side seating management gives the possibility to define the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewers ; you can open a standard behaviour ( the files from the last session or not ) or determine if requested afterwards .
the context menu that usually appear with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; it opens more possibilities :

select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the above dialog appears to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains all the data that were taken at the same time at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded a automatic correlation is performed and the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS trace data are recorded at GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera time needs to be performed with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the deviation for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS period and camera time . lies the deviation and the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related then all pictures in this field .
the options are used for inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this limits and then press the button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog has to use the button OK button to use the button to set the data in the current picture .
the location can also be achieved with the displayed area and enlarge it . if you have reached the appropriate region and enlarge it . the amount must always be selected manually , until you have changed a suff@@ iciently accuracy . the card can be changed manually . the card can be changed manually between map mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ aster module is a tool to convert a number of pictures to a MPEG video in form of a dip .
the MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected photos into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module allows you to add a basic image file . between the individual images , you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all photos will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the dial @-@ format . with this module , it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can only use the medium to burn the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you must first choose the images that will be packed into MPEG dip . then you can create more ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module .
the images selected by you are then included in image files in the portfolio . you can also change the images or modify the contents .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are choosing the file on a TV format , you have to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely will be the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image is set to it . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast is very smooth .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . in doubt the name and the path of the generated file can be set at the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the final mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify a audio file on the name of the audio source file , this will run into the movie . after you can co@@ aching your requirements . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee or in every rest a coffee , if you &apos;re back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets to the right below .
the printing assistant allows to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ oc@@ rates . these combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. in order to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and import your videos stored in the raw format stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . you don &apos;t expect it from d@@ cra@@ w , that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes get better results with d@@ cra@@ w .
first , select the RAW file first , and start the module . the R@@ aw @-@ Image window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optim@@ ise the converting process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for white wine . the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers may be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera is working in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output files and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG is using a los@@ able algorithm and produced for the smallest file sizes .
the tagged Image format , TIFF , maintains the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you prefer to edit your pictures or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as it only accepts a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adjusted to keep the original data .
if you want to select JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata can be stored in the RAW file in JPEG file into the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to break this process , you can ab@@ ort it .
the pile @-@ processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . use this mode if you are sure , for example through testing at a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to transfer file automatically . this is helpful if you were created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all the images in an album . it uses the program to convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all the images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the transfer program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can get smaller or enlarge it . in addition , four types of image changes are available :
proportional ( 1 ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 mm@@ . ) : changes in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged ; you can use this option to adapt to your image format .
not proportional : un@@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed on this option .
the printing process : preparing the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target screen , including background size , Rand@@ all size and background color , is accordingly adjusted .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send chosen images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the coming pictures before . additional images can be placed on the list of sen@@ tim@@ ed images and place there .
after that you have started the module , the images are displayed with the chosen images . over the button images you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last picture you will find a preview on the right side .
you can also extract images on the picture @-@ list and to add up the images added to the list .
from the button images , select the selected pictures from the list of the selected pictures .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the New news window to your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add to the addresses and the subject : the selected pictures are attached to you here .
take care of not too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many images .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images . your configuration is stored and will be used to change them once .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must install the GM@@ @-@ Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file , the comments are joined together in a text file and added the mail .
the PNG format among the menu Images File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adjusted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and not to change the photo quality . otherwise , we recommend JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures from file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original exit data will be added to the illustrated images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can see the status messages when searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the button closure , you can see this window in touch ? EN .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have a window with questions like you want to select your di@@ ash@@ au . you can select between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option associated with Open@@ GL is enabled . however , you have to possess an appropriate graphics card , because otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the file names show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then cut them manually with Es@@ c .
the option is random select that the images are displayed in random order . thus , the order of the pictures is used in the album .
below delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 millisecon@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect . you should also be able to show the presentation your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects that you can choose . random@@ ly chosen by each transition between the pictures another effect .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen at the upper left . move the mouse in this corner to set you up .
with this tool bar , you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next step and stop the dip .
at the left bottom screen , you can see the current file names , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

this is the user guide for &amp; d@@ iting album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read books , but rather like best functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; Home Album ; and look at the quick , screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; then launch &amp; e@@ aled album ; and in the first dialogue you start the demo , if you start &amp; play on the menu for the first time , or select the menu entry in the menu entry . then some examples are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ ely album ; try out .
if you would like to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ ely album ; as a program associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ ely album ; see the time bar . a picture of this strip can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this l@@ ath will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the time strip can display several different time units . each bar will show you a different unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database that displays only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline allows you to inter@@ actively use the following ways : you can select the displayed message preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the time bar will always be displayed in preview photos ) and the time bar will always be displayed the current date of the currently displayed photos when you preview in preview view .

&amp; Home Album ; presents two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; abstract album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the software is described in &amp; k@@ ely album ; integrated version that you can create about the menu file HTML ... call .
before HTML pages must be created , you have to change some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following , each area will be more precise .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a new album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next you choose to see whether a &amp; 2nd album ; -@@ Export file is set to see on the reviews page . you will find more detailed information about export files in .
last , you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML page . this allows you to view that information displayed on the HTML page . note that all the pictures of a party are obvious . however , you can not use all the pictures of a party . you can not use this setting up to hide certain images in certain amount .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the adjustment possibilities are clear , which is why not specifically applied .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those must consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures more than for example , which have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewing of your site may change the resolution at any time . so you can search your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , and if it wants to get a larger image , he changes to higher resolution .
in this setting range you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best you choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent sentence .
first you must select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically supplemented by the next time . this folder you can select either a folder or from K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check this really all for the viewer . if you have created a URL for the base folder a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you should be here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong file .
if the HTML files created from you have not to copy them in the final target folder you have to copy them manually . thus , the import function will need to specify the final target of the files , but the base folder in which all sub @-@ folders are located .
the just described configuration options have been related to all three base folder and URLs . in this case , a sub @-@ folder , whose name you will be set in output folder .
in case you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users from &amp; k@@ ely album ; you may need to comp@@ ile a HTML page for viewing the images . if you have already turned out a lot of time for viewing the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ ic album ; this work must not even make this job again .
with &amp; abstract album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import another in your database . the image teams will be imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . they differ to whether the images can be stored in the file , or whether the images can be stored in the file , you can choose all the images in the file and can spread this file independently . however , the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu file exp@@ orting ... or together with HTML pages , see how to create a .@@ k@@ in file together with a HTML file , it will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file is looking for the images to two times . first , the images are not found in the file of .@@ k@@ in file . these are the images of the URL that you have searched when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for the exp@@ orting images are described , which you may exp@@ orting about the menu file exp@@ orting ...
the most important option of this dialogue is whether you want to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im @-@ files . there are the following three selection options available :
by option manually copy the .@@ k@@ in file , copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
copy the .@@ k@@ in file to copy and copy the files to the .@@ k@@ in file ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ in files are normal Zip files . as most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit . if you do not send the pictures from full size because the .@@ k@@ in file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by clicking that each picture is maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to use a file using the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select &amp; refer page album ; the exported database are described in .
the W@@ iz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you must choose which images want to import , afterwards , in which folders can be copied to import images .
it may be that you &apos;ll be the category people to be imported to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked if you want to imported into the third dialog window , which are to be imported into the third dialog box and to which categories are to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file containing the categories of your current database . an example will see you on the picture .
it simply needs to be simple , pictures to browse and view : if you see pictures you can see you often within different picture groups : watch &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the various steps ( 1 ) fixed information about your images , through ( 2 ) search and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment options .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual , more pictures are spoken , but often simply do these videos with one .
&amp; Iron@@ ing album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top file of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; W photo album ; note the folder where your images are stored automatically . if you would like to read a different database in &amp; k@@ ely album . if you like to start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; d@@ ely album ; with the -@@ c button . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images /
about the menu entry settings / new album ; setup ... proceed to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ ely album ; you can change the different user possibilities in the following section .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call on the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available to the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it was described you as you can set up different features for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialogue that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box , you can establish complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a middle pass@@ wort as explained .
in view the installation options , which are available to you for the list of members . you can select the category with the list of list . in the left window , there is a list of the current category and in the right lists of sub@@ categories .
&amp; W photo album ; distribut@@ ing its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ a . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug@@ in Interface . detailed information here you can find on the homepage from K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ ic album ; however they are sold separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself .
as the modules are used together from several applications together , it may be possible to test the modules with &amp; k@@ ic album ; because you should use new modules first with the demo database . this demo database allows you to open either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ ic album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu assistance . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned .
the applications which are using the modules via K@@ IP@@ I have very different , so it can be , that some modules with &amp; abstract album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage , if you divide functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; thin album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in Alb@@ ums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions using &amp; abstract album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ fast album ; the current album , which is simply the actual view , so all the images that shows you the picture preview view .
in addition to the current album I have to hand over &amp; k@@ fast album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here is &amp; see page album ; as follows :
if &amp; D album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then every entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the entry dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you want to use the category persons , &amp; will be doing so , so if you have selected persons to view and continue to view this module .
since some modules with &amp; ten photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog dialog , and select in the modules which are loaded loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; d@@ ely album ; with your own pictures .
as you have used it from every other K@@ DE application , you will see the window with the tool@@ bar . at the moment , it contains not much more information about your pictures . in the section we will show you no more information about your pictures . in the section we will show you an overview of all the pictures . in the section , please click here for an overview of all available images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ ely album ; is the possibility to see each picture with comments . these include information about the people who were shown on the picture , etc . you can either place each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain remarks . if you are depicted on all images of Jes@@ per and all images in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ ses , as you can read in the section , if you want to see this remarks , when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in see you three lists with a text field by choosing persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ ely album , as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the move of the images within the list : if you have shown for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be illustrated , so that the used names are shi@@ fted upward , the persons can find faster and arrange .
if you prefer a list of ill@@ iter@@ ated list , click the icon for s@@ orting to date below the list .
if you have chosen ann@@ ot@@ ations for each picture individually , you would like to edit any selected photos and note these pictures with comments . click this case simply to the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have several images , for example , with the same person , then it may be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and menu additional entries at one time with a note .
you are located in San Francisco , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ sized . to show you that there is a over@@ group , a special symbol will be displayed .
in the context menu of the atten@@ tive dial@@ ogs there is also possible to add an entry to a existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also add an entry to a category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you are just your categories alphabet@@ ically . see for this .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the dialog dialog by clicking the glue that form the edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window area .
if you have the appearance of the window so to your needs you can be satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you among others the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also send a frame completely out . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and then windows an / out . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview photos of the currently selected pictures , or all the pictures you have not set a filter . for example , you can see the size of the mouse , by simply bend the mouse with the medium mouse button , follow . try it easy .
if you let a painting in the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as an background picture for your desktop .
when you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the images that you want to delete and choose either the removing button or choose the menu selection . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; e@@ aled album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ ely album ; however , you have to store the images somewhere , so that you can record the images somewhere . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ ely album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the disk .
pictures where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , these images are present , so that I can display the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t see this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see this feature , you need to copy files from the folders and to please copy files . if you don &apos;t want to avoid default of the relevant CD . if you wish to avoid anno@@ ying such files , please purchase a larger disk drive to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , you will need to see the pictures that you can see for other un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can see all the pictures that can see your little sister , anst@@ ed and the menu entry everything except at the current view .
in order to set the pictures in the case of the F@@ everything you want to lock the pictures of your little S@@ ister , simply select the menu entry images , which will lock all the pictures you want to lock . if you want to get the pictures again , click the lock .
it is also possible to define a password which must be entered into the file . in order to set up this password , select password from the menu privacy .
please make sure that this picture protection is not very secure . for example , all images are displayed on the hard drive and to the others , anyone can read password as un@@ deco@@ ded text or delete . this kind of password protection can only be read , den@@ ds that are not familiar with or on their own album ; not very familiar to forbid the views of private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ ely album ; manage and to describe hours over hours so you would like to describe it sometime . for this reason you can look at some time . for this reason you can see some picture _ and video viewer . this is what you can start from preview how to start .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
in case the Info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can also check it with the mouse and see if you are displayed . all of these options are displayed after a right click on the viewer . you can see below in this context menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here to view right entries to this . if you click to Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can jump between them and check the keys image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a dip . I then invites you a new picture after a few seconds . as often it can hold a new picture by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us . it started and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ ely album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and to switch back .
when you use the viewer , you can simply pull out the image in the image and zoom out . with the Min@@ us button you can come back r@@ aus@@ ed The Plus key zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot @-@ key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn . with the equ@@ alization of the zoom , each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel image of the image .
note that the only zoom operations work on videos that come in and out come out with the Plus@@ - and mini bar .
with the rotary functions of the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can ann@@ ot@@ ations in the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you can view images you can find a picture of a person whose name you will forget to put on the image . at the moment you can view this image and configure the configuration dialog for the image to view this name . however , it might be possible to mark the picture and see additional pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and select it as good or bad , while you watch one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you are pressed the corresponding letters . in a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features into your images , you can see them in the browser . this can be done in the browser . if you have all the images you have to edit , print or whatever you have chosen . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected image files to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be shown in the preview screen . if you can view categories in DR@@ E view screen , you can simply add features to the pictures by simply press the letters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you can paint your favorite album on the picture .
the ground @-@ old is not saved with the picture , but in the database . on the way you can back down your ground later .
in the way you can see a painting on the painted screen . in order to finish the painting mode of &amp; k@@ ely album ; in order to finish the painting from the context menu . in order to stop the M@@ alen , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to have the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely covered , but documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have to read and understood .
in the object tree you can choose single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire models are presented in yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objective is already selected by the object .
to insert a new object in the slides , select the position where you want to add the object , and click the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are more common positions , the following layout menu will be available , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under control or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click on users to take these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message is displayed with a error description . then , you can report the input error , and re@@ ject the changes with breaking .
when you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation .
if you process a texture or a part of texture , you can view a preview in the own @-@ view pane .
press a preview of the self @-@ view pane and a small example of the scene is displayed with the selected texture . as default , the total texture is sc@@ anned , even if you want to choose a sign in texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) are crossed locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can move these control points with the mouse , thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , van@@ ish the control points and it will display a small cross in the Wireless Internet view . this cross marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change shi@@ fting through pulling in the entire window .
each object has a visual rating level . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visible level of small or equal to the visible level of the visible level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the pane of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical display on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also store multiple windows orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window on or below a screen view , draw the beginn@@ er to the top or lower edge of a view . a rectangle then indicates the new position .
to create a new column , draw the beginn@@ er to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you would like to arrange multiple views over each other , you drag the beginnings in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views from clicking on the board card re@@ iter to the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the fixing window , drag the beginn@@ er to the desktop or click the little arrow pointing left at the beginning .
to view a view click on the small cross in the beginn@@ er bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can include additional views in the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it at any place .
the current window view can save you with a view screen order ... save a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ dering The icon ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry .
a p@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to include a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can also include any number of Remote options , from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or select in the menu View modes ... the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can use the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section to ren@@ dering into the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the features that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used as ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user re@@ flexi@@ ons . an exhau@@ st@@ ive description of the R@@ ender features will be found in the User &apos;s manual for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered using only one beam per pixel , various errors can often appear . these pictures are often shown in curves or step@@ ped effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details will not be displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , images see with this feature better .
if you turn up anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is split again and adap@@ tive because each pixel are depending on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray of pixels . if the difference between color values should be adjusted to the specified above pixels , then both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a specific extra number of pixels using super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid value of between 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between color values are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be monitored individually and by further sub@@ division . maximum depth of records can be set with the depth of depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the beam process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn off J@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ dering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated through POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , when the associated rays is no object .
opens up a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ counter output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray like scene , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported , not yet the complete commander of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or warning , a dialog window will show a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to import source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ ning and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree to the Editor , to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; referring to the source text in the Editor . in order to import objects into the scene , select the source text in the Editor and drag it to the source tree .
with copying and insert into &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also include source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; it &apos;s a scene . usually this is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the self @-@ view pane , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and the version a . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; se@@ eks to convert external files ( for example al@@ fel@@ dd@@ ates ) into the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are interested in the folders , you must also register the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first downloaded file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of vision in the camera view and in the window plates label .
you can set the steps of the points to the grid in the context menu of the Wireless Model Vi@@ ews . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values indicate a more precise wire model and thus a better near@@ ing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for several objects , such as the ball , you can set the detailed level for two directions .
if you cross high level views for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further distributed if the camera uses a extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the projection and vertical proj@@ ections , but requires more time for ren@@ dering proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering proj@@ ections .
if you cross wall in the wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is depicted in a layer pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects are colored . the floor is depicted in a box pattern with two adjustable colours .
if you cross the se@@ iling list , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering scenes is used . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be set . more information on the parameters can be found in the section called R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in section window orders , you can create and store window orders .
the Combin@@ ation field Standard window : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list Ex@@ t@@ ant window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and may not be empty .
the list below shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ lock . you will be able to view the window under the existing window , with box views , and firmly entr@@ en@@ ched the view inside the main window , but creates a separate window .
you have just now &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to start any more specific knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all the steps in this guide , you should take the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a ball on a plane .
but you should keep the following warning carefully before you compl@@ ain about that you get a result of a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should notice these important rules :
if you do not set the camera , do not use the rules for ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have any error free , you can see the following commands at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window is :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable performance you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now often , so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the Wireless Internet view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular note the scene from the view@@ point of the camera ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
the object tree now contains a new record with the designation camera . when it click on it , you can see the content of the object features , in which the different parameters of the camera will be found . in the user documentary about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is later directions , but note that you can change the camera in view control points , with which you can change the target position of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
if you press the button applicable or the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might set a header ( insert @-@ end body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a compreh@@ en@@ sible method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as the floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button applicable or the input button . the new name will be displayed immediately .
the Wireless Internet view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
if you see the object tree exactly , you will notice that you click the entry for the bottom fl@@ aps if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotating and shift . select one of these options to change the possible settings in view of object characteristics .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line , so that you can get to know some of these parameters . select shi@@ fting and adjust the values as follows :
choose the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a somewhat single note at the moment .
in both cases a dialog where you can choose to select how to insert the object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree ( name = Ground @-@ pigment ) , with one click on the button preview see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the only a matte black material , because you have to enter the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . enter the colors for the pigment . also there are many possibilities now , but you now take the easiest option .
if you don &apos;t see a color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you render your image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the colour which you have . here are further settings need . in the bottom list you have to enter two new attributes ( you can also do this entry twice ( you can also do this more often , but the chess board color list can be used only with two colors ) :
select in the object tree any time and change the colors in the pane showing the object characteristics :
you should already be able to execute this step as you have to understand the general work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be done just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : at 1 ( do not forget the input button or button application ) so the ball touch over the ground , as you have shi@@ fted the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ dering results for now a strange result : like before , the ball surface looks like a matte black material . set a suitable material in the following steps .
if you selected the sphere , you can now assign a material to you . as at the bottom , you can add a pigment as a color :
if you indicate your object , then change the name for example into sphere of pigment . click on the sphere of pigments , then select the color and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to set up some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on user or press the input button .
the settings of the brightness and reflection are already shown at some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression that offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; we hope you &apos;ve lear@@ nt so much , that you can create simple , but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ zed a scene , the hypo@@ thetic hypo@@ thet@@ ical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how many atmospheric effects will work like a m@@ ist . thus the scene pixel are processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog you can select a file that you have before using &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
always in case a new model open or create , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
shows the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage have been rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected , if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry can be select only if you have used operations .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new setup or a existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the be@@ zel and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the key combination . you can change or add commands to this option to add or add commands to this option .
opens up a dialog for setting up tool tool@@ bars . you can add tool@@ bar to &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add commands to remove and remove tools .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to dec@@ eive surface finishes without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ map and to use a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color pixel pitch , by using a picture file as color chart .
&amp; kick show ; is a comfortable image viewer and web browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the usage of &amp; kick show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button Return .
you can set if any picture is displayed in your own window , or whether all images should use the same window .
if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , simply tap the first characters of the file in browser window , then a little input field is found in the right lower corner . if a matching date is found , the file is highlighted by pressing a return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Dialog box - &amp; kick show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and machining and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work bench and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cut is specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour which you can set . the default is no full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; embroi@@ dered show ; already the next image in the folder while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a sli@@ deshow .
with this option you will store &amp; embroi@@ dered show ; when the end of the last modified folder will open . at the next start &amp; kick show ; this folder will open in browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . when window mode is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected colour here .
you can &apos;t know &amp; check show , that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can be able to display the program .
this option has been added to the screen saver for large images on the screen . this option is switched on as default .
create whether the sli@@ deshow is set with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the period between image changes to a slide show . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow takes place as long as it is interrupted by the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here you change the key@@ bo@@ zel for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ dos ; in the cart@@ ons for the display case and short commands for the browser .
with this option you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the folder and a window for the files ) and the partial view of the file system with folders and files in one window .

the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ COP features of collection , context @-@ browser , players , playlist , playlist and scripts . a sample @-@ call for the D@@ COP @-@ function break could be &amp; z@@ B ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing function . please check in your script whether all the required modules are available and use the dialog box that the user is not running .
terms &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue B@@ ad@@ error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is . for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in the folder of scripts / Tem@@ plates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts . you will soon notice that the script is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be associated with each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the evaluation of external programs and commands . this is usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; American ; send al@@ er@@ ts to all ongoing scripts . this is why the script should monitor the default settings and react to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . in order to save and store the setup data you have to worry . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ B ; with D@@ COP functions , further information on the new piece ( for example , met@@ ad@@ ata or the denom@@ inations ) .
volume @-@ change volume sign@@ alized an amendment of the volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ization Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ atics &quot; Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the playlist , so that the script can attach your own entry . to remove a custom entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p @-@ arok script script script script script script script script script script script script script script script script script script script .
before &amp; am@@ ra ; terminated , or if the user stops a script , transm@@ its &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can optionally be encoded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ ingo ; 1.3 only accept the script packages with the extension ran@@ qu@@ et@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages equal .
the main thing has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ sar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file right :
when your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side of &amp; am@@ lin@@ king . to your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ lin@@ king ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ ples ; is a audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; American ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprising to use .
with &amp; am@@ ora ; you can simply draw music easily into the playlist , instead of endless menus . perhaps you are looking for only a very particular title out of thousands of your collection . with &amp; am@@ big@@ s ; &apos; s collector @-@ browser and the quick search will you find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some playlist , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist is really difficult for you . and if your decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gen@@ eric USB devices . Moreover , many different audio systems can be used , such as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and sh@@ ick - just the right to experience your music !
normally one must enter the following commands to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources :

am@@ aro@@ K requires only the packet F@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have installed properly ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; am@@ big@@ ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little instruction on how to comp@@ ute K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD require that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example , but we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore , we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because this is an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will issue an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can see the file by clicking on the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org and hang also the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly lies that Tag@@ lib in read more information from this file crashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ way ; is a bit tight .
make sure all of &amp; Ds and libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version . if , for example &amp; am@@ big@@ s ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to crash when working on the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then activate to autom@@ ate . when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ log by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically gives up when a crash ) and send us a good back@@ drop , the error will be solved .
this is in fact that many program files are used as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a@@ met@@ a . but this Perl script fixes the problem .

in order to fix these errors , you might possibly remove any coll@@ ision Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf might require that am@@ aro@@ K will first find the correct version first .

after the start of &amp; am@@ bush , only a empty playlist , how can music go there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files in the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start@@ up window was converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are determined for the evaluation by the user while the points automatically is calculated .
in order to evaluate the pieces , the score list must be displayed in the playlist and select the column evaluation column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files that you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose From the playlist , remove from the foldable menu .
draw a playlist file with your mouse to playlist and let &apos;s go there , just as you would like to make it with other files . it is as simple as : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , the button is kno@@ cked out . click on it .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config software is probably missing you install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ big@@ s ; new . take a look at the lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .
the equ@@ al@@ izer is within the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it on the menu bar with ex@@ tras equ@@ al@@ izer ....
yes , that &apos;s really ! no ! &amp; am@@ big@@ s ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore , the actual question is supported by G@@ amb@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support quite a memor@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even run text and PNG !
it may be ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which can be supplied without any MP3 dec@@ or ( for pat@@ ron@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 , in@@ abet@@ ting

if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the tool has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer provides multiple applications that can be reached at the same time and simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem , and help a solution . you might need to specify a different sign ( e. g. ) .
that does &amp; am@@ big@@ s ; already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ coding . G@@ stre@@ amer reads for most people the best choice if you de@@ codes a dec@@ or with little overhead . g@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coding them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can create distur@@ bed playback . read this error report . the sound of sound buffer in your AL@@ SA entry file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help .
either use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ z@@ ers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts doll in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less applications respond to the visu@@ al@@ izations . yes , this is an error , please help us remedy him .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I like to change to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ using ; why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . do g@@ st register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also wonder on the I@@ RC @-@ channel # g@@ amer .
try this ( finish am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . do then run g@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ it@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ ard register once again , and run g@@ st regi@@ sters . start now &amp; am@@ big@@ s .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with am@@ aro@@ K ?
set aside under Settings ... audio output : enter the device . typically , e.g. HW : 0 for the standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c on one machine with a onboard AC@@ 97 codec and one USB audio device :

enter in the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the sampling rate , channels , and so on .
if you want to use a virtual mix @-@ mix machine , activate the tick with sound card m@@ map .
we &apos;re sorry , but the audio output of the Arts is not further cared for . you are allowed to take this problem even into the hand ! if you &apos;d like , you can use the new so ur@@ gent agent for Arts : )

if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a certain search word , set a Min@@ us character in front of the search term : -@@ something looks after pieces that don &apos;t contain anything .
you can combine these syn@@ tax@@ able variants at any time . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this sear@@ ches after all the pieces that either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating as 50 have not included the comment .
you can define the sequence sequence of entries by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l button , and then click on the right button of the mouse on the entries . the entries will then be given an identification with a number . the numbers corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .

click on the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select charging . in this way your current playlist is replaced by the new . you should save the old playlist , thus under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes , random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately your playlist and you have to add at least one piece itself out of your collection . the recommended parts are added each at the next piece , so your playlist is only filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the final dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated .
the button New fill out the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . playlist the dialog box to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the opportunity to work on . then the dialog will open to the settings of the playlist .
here , enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , and the setting for future pieces will not hear . if the setting is however active , the already played pieces are removed under the cont@@ emp@@ t of the setup .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which songs were recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added after each played track . if you want to set out more than 1 , the playlist is continuously growing , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can choose from existing playlist and smart play@@ lists . if you cross several playlist , you &apos;ll be able to add random pieces of each of the crossed playlist .
some scripts allow their own settings . you can custom@@ ize the script by clicking the script and then click on Settings .
you can install new &amp; am@@ ingo ; scripts to install by clicking on the script . after you install the script will appear to install a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also use new scripts directly from the internet . use this script automatically .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . please select the script file then un@@ install it .
if you are looking for information on the writing , please check the scripts in the Write section .
the dialog window visualization plug@@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ al@@ izations in &amp; am@@ using ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . in order to use a plug @-@ in , enable the check box next to the name .
this quick guide should show you how to create with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD . to repeat the steps you need a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you would like to burn an audio CD from MP3 , or other non @-@ loss audio formats , then remember that you are created when re @-@ encoded encoded quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check whether a audio CD from a los@@ sy format was created . do not use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burner process .
this quick guide should show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to repeat the steps , you have to have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and have put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programmes are generally referred to as Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ er@@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and use with audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis is benef@@ iting from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder @-@ modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three Audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a well developed MP3 decoder used in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . advertisement will be used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : an open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
dra@@ gon@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , nut@@ me@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn it onto an audio CD burning .
SO@@ x : an auxiliary programme that can convert between different audio formats and converting . SO@@ x will be used by the SO@@ x Audio encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : one of the functional scope fully equipped car system for processing , dis@@ assembling and analysis of video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files on a standard level . this may be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different entrance examination of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that can be re@@ produced differently according to music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a comfortable way to download and download projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on a entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has already been stored once , the new file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialogue saving is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you want to save for each single project file Save .
includes the current project . if a project changes and not yet saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what will happen . you can then remove between Save and A@@ mend@@ ments . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and the project will be opened .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project , what should happen , just as would you called for each project file .
includes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each stored project , is asked what to happen so as if you had called to file closing .
when you call this entry , you can choose from the upcoming Dialog files to the project . this has the same effect when you come from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog for the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the media . the Bur@@ ning dialog can only be opened if the project has already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many proj@@ ec@@ z@@ able settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are written about what about the right mouse button ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not used for a multi@@ multi@@ session CD . this is useful for you to see files already using existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustrates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files are removed from the current project . this function does not end files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows you to copy a CD onto a different medium . alternatively , you can also just select a copy of a CD . alternatively , you should also prefer to copy the cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should also want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to burn up a DVD to any other medium . alternatively , you can also just play a copy of a DVD using copy of copying devices . alternatively , the target unit can not be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for Del@@ ete a CD @-@ RW to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens up the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R ( W ) which means that the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . lets you choose between the typ@@ ew@@ ays over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
it bur@@ ns a previously established CD picture . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as No.1 g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
it bur@@ ns a previously made DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a first run DVD video can be converted to you . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the site , but can also be used even standing . it contains information about the le@@ ased video , code settings , and even possibilities to modify the size and cutting black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . these information are displayed in the site view and include properties of the media , such as size and titles length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when a entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small glue at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is b@@ lown .
the folder &apos;s screen is on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content screen . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ lock of the work or throw of the media .
the level of view displays a or out . the level of view enables the choose and pulling files into the project view . the level of view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD folder .
the copy f@@ ails in the project view a or out . the head is a nar@@ rower area that has only visible when the project view has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the other views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part you can adjust the key mapping to it below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs are needed . therefore , system administrators have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can setup general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ ie@@ b . this dialog box is intended for personnel and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a tray tran@@ scription .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , therefore rather your taste and type of task is crucial to which the bit@@ rate programs will give you default .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; function you need to make before make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; features that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program is common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; presents functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) An object can be achieved via the command line : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
e@@ cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) - cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) . add@@ ur@@ anium ( K@@ URL : : List URLs , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) . e@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String Falls , Q@@ String Quart@@ z ) .
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :

&amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily be saved and stored in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many encoding ( los@@ s@@ less pack@@ ets have to be installed in the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and saved in WAV files on your computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this must now be done .
for the second step , advertisement ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer installed . all of these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions that are needed . if , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ r / file format is to be used ? the Chap@@ man Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction over Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copying the protected audio CD ; s : as you said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to interpre@@ t the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to get a protected audio CD ; this program is not possible to get a protected audio CD ; simply avoid the mechanisms of copying it . simply avoid the purchase of copying @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once , the setup dialog can be called ( the setup dialog can be found as often as a suitable configuration ) , after the daily use of a &amp; CD ; this leads you to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will be able to stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ id programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is listed manually .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen pictures with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB is entering on the CD@@ DB file according to the setup map CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made connected to the Internet . )
and - if an encoder is configured in the tab @-@ tab encoding settings in the setup dialog - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the choice with a different encoder can be read as standard . it is to be noted that previously the encoder is configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a ready file to en@@ code it will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; en@@ code and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program@@ mers ( like reading the &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different boxes ( such as Encoder , to setup the encoder ) . you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ axial and compression ratios and helps you choose the right Ko@@ cher .
if no audio information should perish , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there is also other such as &apos; hormone &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; that could possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages include the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats supported by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but more than this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both co@@ sting are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
high @-@ quality sound quality ( for high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG tracks are present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these tools only support MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer sufficient transparency for most people and most of the music tracks acceptable and has already high quality . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , joint Stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good com@@ ug for music of yo@@ ungst@@ ers , portable devices and Aut@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you really want to have the absolutely highest quality without feedback on the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or replaced by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available as a list of parameters . you can be delivered with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code to create folder and file names and the features of music files .
in connection with code programs there are often a combination of programming settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters . the manual or assistance to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ boards ( English : day ) to add MP@@ 3s with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; added . the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters to be used ( = button drawing at the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database to read / enter the information that all other information can be downloaded , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of itself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( acqu@@ iring of the translation ) &apos;m not At@@ tor@@ ney . however , nobody can prevent the information without the &amp; CD ; but there is no information without the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company damage can be added . all information can be received by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ ake ) address in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer that checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; used by fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic at the next horizontal mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and compare the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror image files for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates from the database .
what is the reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who would like to know it , looking for source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done .
to save the l@@ up@@ loaded WAV files , the code can be selected , so that the select file format can be selected . for the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for an advertisement ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab card for setting the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab card itself .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed in the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ ders can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined code . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter of the Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a co@@ di@@ ers , more information about its switches can be obtained via the input of a lame ( lame ) help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . however , &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read list@@ ens and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio code of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c für O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could note that what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; do not control the she@@ ath of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips may give it as you have to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , but they are somehow in@@ secure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all setup and our first &amp; CD ; read an lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps for average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ boards ( tags ) .
you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled pack@@ ets for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for lame can be compiled for example using a search engine , as it is not fully free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source file , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd / cd exists , and that you own write permission ( eg ; by copying anything to copy ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something that is thought to do only once , and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for any exp@@ orting &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ ders for compression of music ( lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with you to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change anything at any rate of a &amp; CD ; if the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; - data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link on the real device name of your running system . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be used , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to select the output records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card map General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be noted , as shown in screen photo .
only In case of complete information please select , so that you will be informed if data are missing from keywords ( tags ) .
the card map CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selective field is simple , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting list name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag records , you can easily change it . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ qu@@ or - &gt; en@@ ame , and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , apart from that example , if you want to enter everything manually , select the selection box and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used if you want to use the database before . however , these can be selected twice if this is worth reading in the offline mode , the two cho@@ ices must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data on request , for the retri@@ ev@@ ing &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server about the internet . how do you know what data is to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . continue reading the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look at a mirror server in your area . on this road , the load will be distributed between the machines . this setting will function as the first attempt .
both work as the server regarding the server , as many Fire@@ walls are bo@@ oted in the protocol 88@@ 80 , there is perhaps more than@@ k@@ fully compatible with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to translate any &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( please ensure that the folder / tmp is based on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one time when using just an existing drive ? add parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore try to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , cross this on to throw the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom file for temporary files : if you cross this check@@ box , then / must be saved , the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored in the private folder , if you don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files .
all in this way , as it is on the screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances , something must be igno@@ red to the right .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is adequate for very good stereo audio systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average about 224 @-@ 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this achieved a good balance between audio quality and storage usage .
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of production of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted as required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the entry file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section , it is described as the process of the reading of the &amp; CD ; the file is arranged on the hard drive . first , we will build an connection to the internet , because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must retri@@ eve . the process of this section is described in this section must be repeated for any exp@@ orting &amp; CD ; it is repeated .
since we are using a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the screen photos a little different from being used for a &amp; CD ; with successfully passed from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; collect , instead of retri@@ eve it out of the Internet . comments are displayed on the differences .
not try the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done so now the &amp; CD ; the drive , which was defined in the main window , have to be inserted .
after a short moment , the tracks and their length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; it could be identified as audio CD ; it could be read from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
for the event that there is more than a entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be embedded in , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD .
if you do not have selected the check box for automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; Settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually dis@@ sol@@ der the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but need the connection to the internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the unit in the first row of the &apos; Aktu@@ ell Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the Command button &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist cannot be entered into the Command button &apos; ref@@ resh title , unless you have an compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ p@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this restri@@ cts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comm@@ ent@@ card . if you set ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on the tab card code settings , and take a look into the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see Help for Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to get more information .
simply select a record that is obvious to the style of the selected CD ; this example is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway , please go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or r@@ ap for example are below Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have already recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . select the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories in the database .
the third button of the tool@@ bar is . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of each piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select the button All pieces choose to select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
when clicking on button selection you can read out the reading process , this window appears to confirmation . click OK then we &apos;ll see a look at the window with the essays and track what is going on .
click on the rider to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window .
this error message appears if you are trying to work with a co@@ id , which you have not yet installed . pieces which were not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered in this example . did you checked whether you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus check out and en@@ code parallel . note the status of the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have configuration options to read this behaviour . the only one which seems to read and en@@ code the results of parallel processes is the result un@@ clear . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have a problem at simultaneous interpre@@ ting and en@@ code ( from however two different tracks ) .
now the last title is dealt , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded into the qu@@ eu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. oder 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the enco@@ ders of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this is why you have an anonymous copy within the &amp; k@@ de ; however , if you are using CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at individuals who compiled the source files and are not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution .
if you are looking for help with the program to needs your needs , if it runs once , the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different other programs , has many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to check the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu is cli@@ cked on the first starting up of the program , without any reference point how it is going to pass from this somehow pure screen ( especially when at the time of the program start no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what about it ? if you read this , presumably the program has already started . it should look like this :
one bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author may not stop this hand@@ book . it is thought to do a manual or change it , may do it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has agreed to this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de to SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these form@@ ulations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he did not have real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke features , but some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project drivers , which will be used for CIS cards as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the text on the screen with changing paint , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of activity of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ or ; -@@ window to move .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ inal or text events ) .
seat support . if you start &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , kick@@ off the next time again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog box with whose help you can choose the desired song .
you can also select a file from a &amp; kon@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows falling . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a music piece , open it and automatically open the button , select the entry button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry once from the menu piece or enter the vac@@ ant paste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you drag it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and play after each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle button of the mouse and drive it with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is too fast or played too slow , you can change to the left and right of the speed display and to get the play@@ able speed . to get back the original pace , double click the template .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if one piece is played , a pressure on the button break or select a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry in the menu piece , interrup@@ ts the play button during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play playback .
lyrics can be stored on two ways in one piece of music . some pieces apply tex@@ ter@@ nis , others use Li@@ ed@@ t@@ orious event and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; c@@ mid ; you can set which events should be displayed , and even better : the event type will be automatically determined , so that you need to set up a song automatically . if you select the entry in the menu settings the entry will automatically be selected , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to set an event type , select from the menu settings the entries text messages or songs . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ise . these will be the series after ab@@ rupt@@ ly . in this section , how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find the menu collection under the item .... Click there on New and give the name to the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the following suitable matches .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , they must be selected in collection manager . there , you can add to the button Adding a song . this appears again the file dialog where you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the adjustment of automatic loading to the collection .
if automatic adding to the collection is added a piece when opening ( using file open or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection automatically .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then add to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song , and then click on .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the menu sequence sequence of the menu , the songs will be played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the Kara@@ oke text .
to jump a song , choose the Next Song &apos;s Next Song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry to previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection @-@ collection , click the button to delete .
temporary collection could not be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is strictly necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izers which are not general @-@ MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events put into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create an MIDI @-@ Map that converts all events of the change @-@ to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus becoming a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite d@@ itor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear often as desired . a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for this is that each occurr@@ ence has a different text ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP . &quot; EN@@ D define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
they see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of each section is reached .
please send me your Map file as an e @-@ mail that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section the patches must be illustrated by General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign of equality is igno@@ red . it is believed that the GM &apos;s patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all @-@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to play on the sound using the number M ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a fighter . in addition to this , you carry the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ en@@ closures ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is a patch which is meant with the concept of the patch which is a different per@@ perc@@ ep@@ tive instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means sound at the sound height of the same same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to view how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as its presence . you have to create 128 items .
you can define several key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names only in the first row .
key@@ boards are mainly used to form tones on the per@@ spe@@ c channel . take a look at the provided key@@ hole .
this section can be used to form a number of channels to others . if you want to replace the first and second channel , simply make it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others require channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
N is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be igno@@ red in the file for this channel ! if you ignore the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be igno@@ red , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option may be useful for example to use the perc@@ us@@ sions patch on the performance channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ z ratio should be multiplied , in which relationship pitch @-@ ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then used only . the value 4096 is used to be used in the map file no dec@@ imal .
this setting is needed , because GM is preparing to play a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 4096 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards will be able to play two sounds up to one octave higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use an MIDI map , simply open the dialog for MIDI settings . you will find the menu settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a full range of pi@@ ke boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these four , you will see what sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed an instrument . if you have an instrument , the button is not more green but red , to view that no longer uses the original instrument .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . the view click the menu settings below the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed when a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
an MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a piece of music must be played , it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so , the same MIDI file can lead on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way .
good , I can ni@@ pp@@ le , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file requires about 50 KB , while a MP3 file requires a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed , and etc ; you have control over all .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install an source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
dis@@ able the settings of automatic Adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can select the arrow key to the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the reproduction . to the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop I must play , if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ( or if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or to play a file , merely go to the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows change and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without being able to add them equal to a collection , turn the setting automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection of files
let us take you to play MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d . so you only want to play the first file . so you &apos;ll adjust the setting automatic Adding to the collection and then open your temporary collection then this is a MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid simultaneously and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent to me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , I anim@@ ate me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ ite ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of leisure time for my ho@@ b@@ bies , but I try to take me a bit time . as ho@@ b@@ bies I have program , MIDI files , make music and phr@@ ases .

one sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer as the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound card . it is not the same as you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs when you could have a sound card , except that you can not hear any music .

the window window is formed of so @-@ called and@@ ed@@ itable windows . there is always the window with the central view . in addition , there is a window with the playlist , and finally there is a window window that will appear only when information is returned .
it is possible to connect the preferred connections under the menu item , but these are individual entries . if you want to play a list of entries , which should be played after each other , then you should use the &quot; thum@@ b playlist . &quot;
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ical database . if you copy a entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the displayed entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and endurance playlist can also be changed by direct ren@@ dition of XML configuration files . of course you can only do the files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / you can simply choose one category of a category click here to view it as the next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML contents will be displayed .
after changing XML files , the same menu must be selected from the menu , or select either the processing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if the work@@ piece mode or another group is selected without leaving the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during the start and end can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change of &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ ier option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / k@@ m@@ player / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation at the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate through opening a different source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive at the end @-@ animation , the user can stop the application a second time .
an easy example of an start@@ up animation can be seen in the display of a favorite photos : t@@ lt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; Me@@ et &quot; / gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; they are in the directory testing / several examples of S@@ MIL the von &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported .
there is a rider to configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog for &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
a different tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of col@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback tool in the configuration dialog for &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured through manual loading of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module @-@ Mozilla Firefox :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be re @-@ bed the special box @-@ bed for YouTube in the playlist to XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a console application and to search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . when no error occur , is the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
therefore always a pre@@ defined past@@ ime for a particular M@@ ime Type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must also be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on can play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV channels can be configured , the scanner can be used directly from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) Settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog box in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be selected ports to be selected . the default encoding must be selected ( e.g. , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB to it .
since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , it should work as X@@ video ( probably this kind of game of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video up@@ lin@@ ux expansion for the X server must be functioning properly in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , the KM@@ players are used for different names . at the time of this documentation , these documents are d@@ v@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ resource , v@@ v@@ d@@ source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , they start playing with the playlist .
are there references as I can drive my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after installing the device . absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom the CD@@ ROM drive is sure .
X@@ ine starts slowly on , why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , only the first time is x@@ ine check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surface areas and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; cra@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional written application application . under Unix such systems it is likely to be used for the package &amp; tex@@ as ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux ; the distribution should be used for installation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project also contains some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without any compilation and are included on the tile ; -@@ website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users have probably hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation is considered . if the support for this project or documentation was requested , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; web site .
step forward or when comp@@ iling &amp; cra@@ ck@@ ering ; on or if desired , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list of k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ area for use &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ area for use of all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; services in a graphic surface and within this one simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; benefits and conversion tools for those . to be called , the easy to operate assistant , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities to learn the manual may be dressed in Kate . users by &amp; k@@ ile ; can be taken there directly by reading the chapter with the Editor &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right out@@ comes : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . you can use the original reference &amp; tex ; difficult to use , it can also use a hold ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic yield is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
here , just a good deal of view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to do so . to treat &amp; lat@@ ex ; right to rule , good buttons , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the same as other recording languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alization of such features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text format . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ ent@@ ine class , the place starts with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed again .
the high @-@ level assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a complete function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : this hereby announces the type of the document to create a document : article ( article &#93; , book &#91; Directory &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Document ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Document &#91; View &#93; , Fo@@ il &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
encoding : hereby the character encoding of the system will be used . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be converted ( to correct processing and lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the usually used packages for lat@@ ex &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they can only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN standards ) should always be used with the creation of German texts .
new users are now no worry about . it is just a short description of functions and further information on this section are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it will not be closed with great problems . however , it was not closed down by the modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you by the high@@ lighting time and time .
with automatic adjustment of environments , in case of a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically det@@ ach a space line ( e.g. \ \ by command { command } . this function can be de@@ struc@@ tible in the menu settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are normally sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the h@@ ough and sub@@ mer@@ est element ) :
at the view of the document in the structural view the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective request .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be found very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; lower right file is created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the medium mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line at the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI / file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font , and is besides PDF the exception mode of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools available to view , conversion and print from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ts@@ search , the elements of the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked on a element in DVI ; -@@ file is cli@@ cked on the exact opposite section in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is cli@@ cked on the corresponding section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is drawn at the corresponding point in DVI ; -@@ viewing angles .
Master @-@ Document : this function is being used with several files . using a Master document , the work is simplified using other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project can be set on project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( unless no error in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file on p@@ n@@ der@@ un@@ gen@@ â s will be done . there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast installation .
at consideration of the re@@ working tool bar , the three large selection lists should be found in all . the selection box for the rapid integration of shared elements in parts , chapter , sections , ... The understanding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Further is to be available for articles such as Tags , Fu@@ Ã ¼ notes or Notes , which are the dead@@ lines for you :
name : with this command a designation for a section , a picture or different element is created .
in reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection according to a selection box ) .
when using quot@@ ation is displayed a selection list with literary entries . for the processing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author are necessary to work . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; and &amp; c@@ bi@@ tex ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; - Files primarily are written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ . is used for determining the font names . it is possible to define the font names , the joints , etc . , there are the following fonts for disposal :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection places available : 1 . the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and the legend of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by the bottom by hand .
the font cl@@ as@@ ps according to the command \ \ ent@@ urine class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the Scrip@@ tures . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this may be done also in the text .
as soon as the above source code document is entered and lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way for this is the use of the menu building or of the button extension .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically expi@@ res automatically .
if the compilation of the document command , the protocol should be sought after the errors . when using quick@@ ens should be started &amp; oc@@ ul@@ arly . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
a environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . if , for example , a report with the font is to be written . for example , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { den } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ by { on environment } may be closed , then the introduction of the font house within the surrounding area â . ( Hu@@ ge Hu@@ ge ) .
these changes are only possible within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { den } to \ \ by { den } ) . there is no show ( number ) for the number of changes within a environment .
there are many opportunity to attach the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , c@@ anned pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. are added to the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { # } : this command is available for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { on } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be expressed with \ \ &apos; ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { odds } and ends with \ \ by { quota } .
after background writing of the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; label language is shown , now a step @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
as soon as the assistant was entered a bit text , some adaptations for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . these should be a quote , a few positions in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a po@@ em to use to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , the Editor &apos;s View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to the editor ( at the internal viewer ) , whose window is closed .
as soon as the DVI / file is created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a partial file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF format or computer screen TVs .
for printing a &amp; DVI , file are the same steps as you can view the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then be printed by a file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly set ) .
the tool bar uses the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is created , the conversion may begin in more common formats by means of buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary search guide the direct jump from the editor to the current position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; Lat@@ ex files . just Modern under Settings K@@ ile may be setup ... tools can be made of construction .
in order to be placed forward , the mouse poin@@ ter will be positioned in a row of the source text and then connect to the mouse button . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; you need to be specified as text editor ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor can be set ( Settings ... Editor )
in case using quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewing does not include an error . should an error occur , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file contains the error source in the source code . in the editor , the log file will always be used between the errors . in order to view the incorrect line , the error file is cli@@ cked on the error in the log , and jumps to def@@ ective on the incorrect line .
once upon the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to be selected for the selected template for the document . the default options are :
when selecting the empty document , a document may be used either from the ground or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document . more information on this section are included in the section .
using lat@@ ex users by &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates that are created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded , to facilitate creating a new document .
to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file may be created or create a new file . you can create a new template via a complete document and selection of file template documents .
when creating a new document from a document by means of a new document , some character strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or character encoding ) . these variables can be setup in settings ... Settings will be submitted .
therefore , when creating the own template , it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS of $ $ : this character string will be replaced by the input in documentation class . typically it will be in such cases : \ \ Pen@@ et@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { complete article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant , and thus creating the commands throughout the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps has been accomplished :
when creating a new document , then the own presentation can be balanced instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one in the Internet and can be found under the above steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for you are made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; you can get out .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his opportunity to learn the manual may be dressed in Kate . users by &amp; k@@ ile ; you can also start reading the chapter by reading the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command line , which can be called upon the program of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you contains an exception description of almost all commands that are in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use you can be found as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with flying tr@@ l button to fill the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way marked by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with the left mouse button mouse , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
using the arrow keys with penet@@ rating Shift to taste parts of the source text in the Edit@@ or@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse the various types of source codes and these results . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and mathematical form@@ ulas are distinguished by another color .
many assist@@ ants are added to this dive . this is an own way of book@@ marks within the text . the menu item is highlighted or the respective key to the n@@ urs@@ or or last dive @-@ mark . in this case , this diving stamp is highlighted , so that they are automatically emp@@ tied in the first input of a character .
the edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent choice for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code added , special commands for their selection . among them , the following commands are included in the text code :
choose a complete section ( group of lines that contain on both sides an empty line ) . these expanded importance is not covered with through ( like in other text boxes ) . these expanded importance is close to &amp; lat@@ ex ; the only remarkable thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore that the distance is separated by two empty lines .
choose the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command is also translated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a hot star ( * ) at the end .
to allow a part of a document , you can get to this first . &amp; Kate . offers the key short@@ cut of C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offering his own commands for a faster fee . below , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
a complete set of paragraph . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of filling stations .
it has been clear that environments offers a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; play . that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands below do environment for a single or full work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
at the beginning of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the surrounding area .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
when the cur@@ sor occurs before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } will be spra@@ yed at the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
in the input of many sh@@ ame@@ ful environment commands can go quickly to the sea view . this command close the most difficult environment , so that the surrounding environment will not be closed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Be@@ ing Te@@ X group a few important commands that are to them from doing environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ ammer .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the sof@@ tw@@ ist cl@@ ammer .
if the cur@@ sor is behind or behind the wi@@ ped cl@@ ammer of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , will be inj@@ ected at the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
in the input of many tigh@@ tened groups cl@@ amps can go quickly to the sea view . this command close the most widely held group , so that the hidden structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be closed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings as a G@@ Ã ¼ n@@ os@@ gene body are used . for the purpose of this purpose , the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &apos; for two simple beginnings is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close attention , for lat@@ ex and lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic adjustment of the double beginnings may be setup under settings .. La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there are also many other languages ( e.g. n@@ urs@@ or French ) or French or French beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
when fitting in Shift ; Regist@@ ered &amp; k@@ ile ; a smart te@@ aring sl@@ ump . in case the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is found , not just a line breaks , but also the command \ \ item .
within a table -@@ environment , h@@ itting &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a connecting line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; it is intelligent enough to support pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added to the settings .. La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users can arrange the columns in tables -@@ ambient and all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to one another . if this tab is not possible to allow the tab@@ s in the previous tab . although this tab@@ ulator is not fully sufficient , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some spaces for the columns of the current tobacco box .
although &amp; Kate . already provides a good source code completion , it has been extended in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to build special commands ( mostly for example &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three according to demand and the other two are for automatic locking devices . all these modes will be setup for different ways of working with different settings ..
at the beginning of a new environment through the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ by { environment } on an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ oo , the last character from the entry is removed and completely de@@ pri@@ ved . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of its parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are displayed by selecting a command , so that a simply jump to these positions by means of diving stamps is possible and the desired parameters will be added .
there are some types of att@@ itudes to these lists . you can refer to the lists for this lists . it is possible to refer various W@@ emb@@ ell@@ ists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as wra@@ pping of the general language used .
the command mode is not limited to environments . it can always be entered with a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the completion mode will be used as often . on the other hand , the environments will be used as often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the use of environments .
during the call of the incomplete setting of the menu or the key@@ boards of Alt + Shift to the surrounding area , the order to open the surrounding area will automatically be opened and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . thereafter , the environment may be continued on sim@@ pl@@ est way and by pressing the input ) .
once this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogn@@ ise that it is a first \ \ item command to be opened .
referring to att@@ itudes ; setup ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists are used . this mode uses the list of del@@ etion mode for example and tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; supported custom lists of ab@@ brevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by l@@ ent strings . the lists can be set up in the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ x .

specify the name of the file as the result should have . the file is normally stored in their home folder .
the plug@@ ins , which are &amp; quantitative , have a little bit capable of doing . this allows you to benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until som@@ ebody can build the desired law &amp; quantitative ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be used below .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ Part we will start with the menu plug@@ ins . thus the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug@@ ins of the plug@@ ins and adding new standards . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element within it :
here you can enter the search engine . add to the plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative information ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quantitative editions ; supported by Team Members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the names and email addresses are self @-@ explan@@ atory . N@@ ick@@ name is the user name of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project conductors .
the user can look out from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who it is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and pressing S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
top names and setting of its own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information about remarks .
in addition to the overview of its team , there is another advantage through the recording of the members of the team : it may be an event for information about the team leader when something is happening . see for more information .
event promotions are promotions that happens when something is happening in the project . an example would be able to record and closing a message if a file is secured , or a script that will insert a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , processed and deleted .
an email is sent to the addresses selected in the receiver . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note to the note is simple . it can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary zone followed by An@@ od@@ yst@@ ic ext .
ann@@ ot@@ ations can be sent a certain member of the team . in this case , syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( top name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the top name of the first team member has been cited in this project : team leader Head Sub@@ project Manager The area manager or sub@@ project names should be given the corresponding range or sub@@ project names , as shown in the examples below .
top names and roles names are independent of large or small incl@@ ines , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; Be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages that D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is supported and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages .
the settings are att@@ ain@@ able via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quantitative information ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the connection can be found in .
the settings can be called by Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages which will be addressed to each other .
the behavior of &amp; quantitative information ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / small batch statement of tags : large / small @-@ scale identification of automatically added tags . normal great / small scale is added , the tags will be added as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Klein@@ sch@@ ow of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / small scale , the attributes added automatically , the attributes are added so inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags : if attached , is optional for tags , for the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
non optional tags automatically shut down : as above all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start @-@ up and end @-@ day automatically : if switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automated transformation of ac@@ z@@ apping characters into the corresponding encoding during installation .
M@@ ime types : fac@@ et@@ yp@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . by using the Standard , the standard results can be recovered .
default encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways to open open files ( where the coding of the file can be addressed ) , but this setting will be em@@ itted from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected . this setting will be em@@ itted from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative error ; created regularly backup copies , such as a blackout or crash when next start of the program can be re @-@ produced . this is not the same as saving the file . also for even stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors or own view ( or the documentation can be presented in a map ) , which makes it possible to preview the preview and the source at the same time .
set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful if the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range serves to the tax of the possibility to dis@@ embar@@ k the indication of war@@ nings through an@@ uts of no more questions .
the place around the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source pane in shared mode . see the different modes available .
the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action , it is possible to change the structural changes with the mouse button to make the m@@ ack@@ ing action .
in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ de in tree to work automatically and how deep in an amendment of the structure can be opened . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups such as these are not found in the current document .
the area for the fixing of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which are un@@ folded to extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each may be divided for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , it can be valid for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ations something else means in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are equipped with K@@ Part applications from third side , which can be used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ i@@ vo@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug@@ in , if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is delivered to the plug@@ in for the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the repository .
component in &quot; Only @-@ l@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using . only for reading @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative , whether the entered information is correct . select the save entry if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative error ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting was completely redesigned . as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ugger . instead of this , a deb@@ ugger plug @-@ in concept was implemented to support various implem@@ ent@@ ations using plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug@@ in available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ ph@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add .
the use of de@@ bug for a project starts with the choice of a suitable Deb@@ ugger plug@@ in to the project settings . using the button options next to the Deb@@ ugger plug @-@ in selection box can be changed the specific settings .
when a deb@@ ugger activ@@ ates a deb@@ ugger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative / User Interface :
a view where the variables are displayed by super@@ vis@@ ing variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding point are listed , with line numbers and conditions listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view where the output ( as in HTML ) the deb@@ tor is shown . it normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of deb@@ ug@@ gers all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to Deb@@ ugger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in to allow de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , that must not be counted on a deb@@ ugger that it must not be counted on normal conditions .
the counter@@ part at deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ugger or end the l@@ ug to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to allow de@@ bug requirements . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the edition of this requirement is shown in the Deb@@ ugger edition .
the deb@@ ugger that starts to start with the implementation of the script and to send information about the super@@ vis@@ ing variables as well as the currently executed lines is continued . if this is done , the implementation will be resum@@ ed before a deb@@ ugger that it starts with the request .
shows the Deb@@ ugger that start the execution of the script , without information to super@@ vis@@ ing variables and the current line number . if this is done while a script was given , the execution begins , as soon as a requirement is made .
the monitor leads to the next statement in the script , without the functions or include files .
the monitor leads the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible is in functions and include error adjusted .
shows the deb@@ ugger that over@@ go and walk to the next , as there would not be the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the primary value will appear in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and allows you to adapt to your needs , and help us to become better .
documentation type Ed@@ iting packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative information ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ and scripts ; your simp@@ licity and flexibility are made of &amp; quantitative ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script file and / CSS ; s / D@@ T@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and file attach@@ ments . day @-@ folders includes two file types , symbol@@ ised and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ aries of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document when a user may ever use .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , download or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details on the conversion .
this document describes how to create XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quantitative ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bars enable quick insertion of tags in a document without any risk of a writing .
tag folder are nothing as a folder . you contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use so many as possible , so other users get a better viewing and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in simple way .
that is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it can &apos;t contain anything but nothing about itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when used is used , att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . gives the name of the class , where this method is heard . ( family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attri@@ bute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the t@@ lt . text &gt; -@@ Day is intended . this is an only element of element .
describes a attri@@ bute a tags that this element can only be used for each attri@@ bute . additionally , it sets the name and the type of attri@@ bute . additionally , there is further tags that should be shown how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
are you used for filling used source codes for the attributes shown in Day Edit@@ or@@ dialog , and in the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative trade ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ method@@ ology name within &amp; quantitative ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ology . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ n@@ ty % , this means the name of the current tags .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur only once . it is an only element of element .
sets the position of the attri@@ bute tex@@ tured a tags within a dialog box . this day can only be used for each attri@@ bute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each group ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the tags that are within the defin@@ ite tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be chew@@ ed and closed .
space character does not influence , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; c@@ lt ; wh@@ om@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; article &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start up in the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ window to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog appears to follow its simple instructions .
this feature is currently not available . currently , verification only occurs when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes that &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic .
in the following example , for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP , loading function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ engine@@ ered = &quot; string &quot; status &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed by D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD settings ; for a list of selected &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; LT ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD ( / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) N@@ ick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
to set up a action with Settings promotions ... will be created . click New Action for the same dialog :
this action assigned short@@ cut , with clicking on the user can be assigned a key@@ ring ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard shelf .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detail panel and inserted by the action in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it &apos;s not limited ) that will change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) , even the quick start -@@ dialog , or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
first , the script must be given the script and the interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scripts that are variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative information : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current documentation . in case of a local document file , file is removed from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative issues ; only one instance is running , the text was used to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control and using the quantitative text .
parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current documentation or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input of &amp; quantitative parameters can be expressed as default . in the selection dialog , input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default settings . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally meaning@@ ful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the issued application may also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal issue , based on the default issue . the error message is to be specified , which is to be specified by the default output specified by the default issue :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the case there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure your actions .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action Kn@@ op@@ press at the lower end of the window starts the edit mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the Tag attributes and you are planning your use , enable a dialog to edit &quot; Tag &quot; when available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graph more programs ( or where otherwise it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 Pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Be@@ ing Size other .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to realize what the action does , but also all other users of &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
regarding the fact that the day began , I decided to create an opening button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually going to be interpreted , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user can be displayed in the current document .
after creating the symbol no need to be connected with the action . this is done by the menu with Settings promotions ... ( in &amp; quantitative le@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is found , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags if there is still what else , or confirm with OK .
suppose you want to add a few common &amp; quantitative ; -@@ functions to tool@@ bar or add it to a better overview by some separ@@ ator into several groups . make sure that the tool bar is selected for the tool bar . make sure that the tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( above left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to add the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the arrow to the tool@@ bar .
I want to preview a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator does not support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the Start Button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure your file folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most significant enlargement of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the script language or the form language which you like . therefore describes this chapter as I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could test your own documentation , see if anyone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you have to build an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file , the first part we handle here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c = Path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations , e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation 2 = A@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = html 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c Your = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 , = Table of Cont@@ ents = Set@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... introduction = Fin@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = n@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
please note the # ahead of Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there are no known limit for the play@@ site ( except by understanding ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but give it a try yourself .
you notice that the table of contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent at the top end of building man@@ tra &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to and &amp; t ; sign . these should be replaced by amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative trade .
the content section is the scope of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is intended to display the documentation of the context @-@ sensitive help . by selecting the function called and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would display documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file attach@@ ments .
a simple list of lin@@ eup separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can store your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and can be stored in accordance with $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Sat@@ a / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / etc .
if you are sure that these well and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example , documentation is used to use the &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud of being involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative le@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the copy of resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scrip@@ ting tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main @-@ Archive , where all the other &amp; quantitative articles are checked , and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the release . to sign the resources , what it is ensured by a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is ensured , both for our Team as well as for the future user .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can specify one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be empty ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking the up@@ loading .
the upload can also instantly upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installing , we examined &amp; quantitative information ; the integrity of the resource by examination of integrity and Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems , it can be returned correctly . if the integrity and the resource is correct , a message appears with the speci@@ fying the owner of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quantitative ; but the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in everyday XML format . there are the easier way to convert D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD loading and Convert in D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file containing the D@@ TD @-@ description , which should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
the aim name : created by the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / Sat@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder with this name .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE chair line : the string that appears in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ L@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / or www.@@ v@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of D@@ T@@ EP according to conversion : when activated , enh@@ ances &amp; quantitative ; according to conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quantitative editions ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand and make full use of &amp; quantitative concepts . this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little benefits .
in &amp; quantitative ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally , and projects . this differentiation affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quantitative information ; util@@ ised , available . of tool@@ bars via promotions , everything is indicated in the common folder of &amp; quantitative issues ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then stand to each in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local items constitute a personal collection of web @-@ products for a single user . this are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local items are stored in the user directory , so that they can use only this user personally .
project zo@@ gen@@ ic elements are available only within a certain project . this can be done by &amp; CSS ; patterns can be created especially for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder of the project , which are common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ MDI ; consists of several main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ windows , the building point , the boxes of boxes , with information and tool@@ bars . please sm@@ ite in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the Cart@@ ridge with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentation , such as close the current , other or all cart@@ ons , re@@ load , delete or upload CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click to the editor sector lead to an additional context menu regarding the provided document of documentation , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the mouse under mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file if the string signs under the mouse poin@@ ter a file .
at the top end of the editor , the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors are currently lab@@ ored and with HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tools are shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; le@@ ap@@ l@@ us , tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they include one single day , e. g. &amp; lt . if you insert it into its document , then click the icon that the day represents that several attributes ( such as anchor ) , insert it , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the in@@ sights ( Q@@ IT ) allow to navigate to the information about &amp; quantitative information ; to navigate , to open and walk through . in the representation with boxes of boxes are available for files , project , patterns , docum@@ ent@@ aries , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative information ; this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project using right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading , or delete the files from memory medium can be performed using the text menu .
another way of &amp; quantitative is the use of templates . almost everything may be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire site &amp; etc ; there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which in which context them will be used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more about templates can be found in .
here you can find information about the available script . the concept of the out@@ sourcing in Global , Local and Project is also working here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . via the right button of mouse , further functions are available , to edit or send with an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active documentation . by clicking on a element of the element set the cur@@ sor is opened on the position of the element . by law @-@ click , a list of commands regarding navigation and recycling of the tree .
this tree will appear among other civil inten@@ tions . with it , you can change the attributes and name spaces . this enables the change of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation to find Web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre@@ packed documentation for &amp; quantitative information ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quantitative information ; two boxes of boxes at the lower end of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this cartridge driver shows information about any in Qu@@ anta current script . for example , the D@@ TD uses the current documentation and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this cardboard box shows all the errors in the mark@@ up of the current documentation . &amp; quantitative scripts that are executed , specify all error messages ( as it is available ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative animals ; tool@@ bars are extensively developed and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the respective command . the cho@@ col@@ ates of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
a further function of &amp; quantitative is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; quantitative T@@ sar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; quantitative ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ files on your system . in order to get a complete list of options that can be delivered to the configure , enter . / --@@ --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not performed here .
if you have problems when starting from &amp; quantitative ; you should check if your path comes to the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; Be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative development tool has been optimized for rapid web development and combined a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quantitative patients began to deal with a obvious mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would be an independent , advanced mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
not limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative is limited ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web @-@ development tool . assemble : if one can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; em@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore it should be the suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be recorded , that &amp; quantitative community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based on the outstanding application of Why ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; - rum@@ ours is not only that possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative ; as they need it for their need .
&amp; Be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web @-@ to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this enables you to dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ coated action , scripts and tools are possible to enlarge it . ( more info may be found in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast Web@@ development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detailed documentation is a help of help : / quantitative ( either of these URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or help : / quantitative information ) .
&amp; quantitative ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ encer @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ an@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time when you can open a file , the oldest one is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section above templates . you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder will only be reported .
converted to the insertion from the clip@@ board there , special characters for &amp; HTML ; notes , so that they are displayed correctly and not to be understood using the browser as form@@ att@@ ing scheme .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ editing , which the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anch@@ ors / day .
switches the block selection , or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift . click to select .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
sear@@ ches a character string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
shows the message window or not on . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of script and Deb@@ ugger .
- and insertion of the problem por@@ ters at the lower edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , as soon as it changes to the structural tree .
shows the symbolic links from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when it is book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu together with entries before or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
Book@@ marks from other opened documents will be group@@ ed from the menu , according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quantitative editions ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the repository .
searched the project folder of new files that could be there . that allows , e.g. graphics files in your project folder or a folder to copy , and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
Settings , like &amp; quantitative editions ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantitative information , please see details .
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only within this menu if you have assigned them this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . only created the names . actions need to be added to the settings . promotions are stored on tool work@@ ings or you will be asked to save if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removed a tool@@ bar from the field of sight . does not remove them from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
with this you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative account ; -@@ Team that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars onto the main server where every other can access it . see in .
upload a &amp; D@@ TD , which you have made and convert any other and convert to the &amp; Be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description .
re@@ loading / ref@@ resh the functional@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is meaning@@ ful if the dischar@@ ges of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not allowed to load the shop .
this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is charged , there is a sub @-@ menu menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ pin .
activ@@ ating or de@@ activ@@ ating the intelligent import of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . smart insert means that &amp; quantitative information ; inser@@ ting the tool bar if this day is contra@@ di@@ ct the rules .
the available plug@@ ins in the plug@@ ins are listed below . click the menu option . click on it activ@@ ating a activated plug @-@ in disabled .
select the syn@@ tax@@ ing mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version from .
elec@@ ts the type of interest number . very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms to the developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checking the syntax of the current document using selected &amp; D@@ TD , using the external use T@@ id@@ y .
immediate conversion between different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . it is recommended to use the card reader mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; quantitative mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition this menu contains a entry for each open sub@@ window . with selecting a contract , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
the display of the status bar switches at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window to or out .
the changes in this dialogue covers any application which use the HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers .
jud@@ ging the behavior of the Edit@@ or@@ window . in the Docum@@ entation of &amp; Kate ; it &apos;s details .
a dialog appears where you can delete items from the tool@@ bars or add what can be changed .
this should create a help with the field of mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; Be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but like with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative representation ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled to the top of the project , such as the complete directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name the file is automatically completed .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the names of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the expansion web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository .
here is the server address of the machine that you want to access , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you are empty this field , the default settings of the selected log is used . depending on the remote machine the remote machine could be needed .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great , if you have static we@@ bin@@ ations you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you must proceed differently .
incoming if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be mounted . if a project is started from scratch , it is not an@@ ted .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to Gut@@ th@@ inks .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by plug@@ ged or , by removing the cogn@@ ac , cl@@ amps from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings , which simpli@@ fy your work . this settings can also instantly upload the menu properties in the menu tree in the bottom window or with the push button Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) which can be igno@@ red for projected operations such as project folder .
supplem@@ entary option to above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded at the opening of the project . can read more about project views .
you can select the desired deb@@ ugger . at the moment , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is found in . the Deb@@ ugger plug@@ in can be set with the options options . in addition , the error search will be described .
in the lower window profiles allow up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well the display of a building permit for the content of the server for each profile , by viewing a very own design for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited and deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the lower window configuration , one can change event promotions , and add these promotions , change or delete . event actions are executed when a previously defined event happens , such as the sick@@ le one file . see also the details .
by default , &amp; quantitative and quantitative ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior can not be influenced by now .
to open a different project , select project Open ... from the menu project or the symbol Project Open from the tool@@ bar . the Project Open will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if the quantitative file is closed , the repository will automatically be stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , changed files . the same happens if you charge a new project .
the project implementation gives free access to the files in the project . here , the files can be managed in the current project .
the file rest@@ ates itself also , however , the entries are opened and open with the right mouse button menu with the right mouse button menu selection menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the high @-@ tech files . see .
allows removing of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button will be bl@@ ended to remove the removing .
the password will keep in the kernel memory and forgot . this possibility is useful if common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password will be stored on the disk -@@ Option not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantitative trade ; many high load profiles can be created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing , or create a profile will see this dialog :
this is the server &apos;s name to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ k@@ shaft , this is either a tim@@ eless function or a danger . do not use it according to your discretion . the password will be saved on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read well , but everyone with programming language can see it easy to see clearly in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. through easy exchange of view , many files and tools can be loaded and replace the currently open@@ er files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative compounds ; with which one has to do most . this helps maintain productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative information ; to own work@@ ings .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ; preferably over the menu tool@@ bars can be tra@@ ce@@ able . usage and add @-@ in can be differenti@@ ated down in the section add of tool tool@@ bars .
the tool bar and the symbols are possible to be set out either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar buttons or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to one action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action illustrated that are self explan@@ atory to use .
the tool bar and the actions on them can be set in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set the settings .. .
templates are in the essential document sc@@ allo@@ p , code cut@@ lets and files for short@@ cuts . &amp; quantitative file formats with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , shift or any of the system existing directory in the template tree ; it can be applied in &amp; quantitative ; in roughly the limitations which are intended for the fil@@ esystem .
some were using &amp; quantitative information ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set before use in the beginning of each template .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be created by any text documentation type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . it makes a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the same manner to be efficient . some examples may be found in the store@@ house under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not added a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be added to the documents . you can find everything from a final volume up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for you . you are a collection of various documents , which can be arranged in a file structure , summarized in a compressed t@@ ar archive . at present there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
create a document structure after plat@@ ters ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As template - save as local template ....
as soon as this is done , you notice that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template does not appear in the repository .
select text in your document and click file as a template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be moved with pulling on the site template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only based in a template folder . it can be used all file management functions such as pulling and add or insert about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a file in the file tree or in the repository files to create a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , a name for template will be secured , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very fast @-@ oriented approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically together with &amp; PHP , creating files , add files or linked with them . additionally , some Things can keep on using templates very pro@@ found in the eye .
the basic structure in the lower window Tem@@ plates is based on the files based in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / Interpre@@ ting and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Sat@@ a / Tem@@ plates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
in order to define the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to choose Properties tab in the context menu Properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this sel@@ f@@ le can be bl@@ ended , as soon as the attributes have been inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders . if a master folder would have been set , it would appear templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the Bla@@ h would appear with something like Text @-@ Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , it is probably found in a master folder .
allows leading or re@@ printed text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot parts for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying attach@@ ments to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot lines are already compatible with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , you have the context menu ( indicated on the right button mouse button ) on a full command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; Be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which are accessible via the menu views . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divide the editors in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : it invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and run as required source code editor , where the implemented changes in the source code can be seen in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor to a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it shows a small green symbol of the V@@ oh@@ and@@ y of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is also possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . there is no plans to change these behavi@@ our@@ al .
the second mode works exactly like the first , but that at the same time runs both in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; editor are visible , and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the key transfer of the active cur@@ sor of a window to the others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . according to choice of V@@ PL ; -@@ view it can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set in addition to a small range for fast calcul@@ ator and a large range for slow motion .
suppose you want to change the title of this website , that &apos;s the editing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to alter the suspension of the label .
met@@ a tags for storing information on the document itself , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down below or removed . one click into the list allows the change of the content , such as key words on the column name and key@@ word key password 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the view from sites in the browser . you can add CSS rules using the buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to implement an external CSS styl@@ ing template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sors is possible like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor can still be used as usual . the text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by means of feedback or dist@@ i@@ aste .
the insertion of tags will be made in the same way through tool@@ bars , such as in the source text editor , subject to note that the insertion of tags must not be removed e.g. if an anchor day , en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed with text , each other surrounding anchor is to be removed .
some tools such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ assist@@ ent are disabled . you will later be working in &amp; V@@ PL ; later , in this release , the tables or lists can be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styles can be tra@@ cked .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . why &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously changes to many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was many conflicts involving cl@@ amps .
the program used by myself only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indications of the digits , where perhaps only the influence had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in one line and changes to white characters . later , lots of more useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare fast text , copy it to the clip@@ board and add it in one of the reference window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ called file browser .
this is also supported by two @-@ way cl@@ amps . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece co@@ de and change changes . the merge editor below the differences of conflicts allows the dis@@ sol@@ ving outcome . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . this editor shows three qu@@ ell files when merge :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; helps you also complete the same and mer@@ ging file . this screen photo shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; with the folder assemble :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and di@@ vis@@ es the possibilities of today &apos;s paint monitors . if you often have Ko@@ de check , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are vis@@ i@@ bly displayed . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see this on a glance at the column on the left side . ( no trouble changes if nobody changes the back . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates what file is different . red color means that both of files are different .
if all files are named the same name , but in different folders , you can use the Ti@@ pp@@ work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 file folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder with folder 2 folder with folder 2 folder with folder 3 folder
the opening dialog allows manual entry to file names , select the selection of file browser ( file ... ) or select a last modified file from the list box . the opening dialog will give you a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out .
through the button folder ... you can also choose a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge folder will be selected . if you choose a file , then used B and C , but use a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
when inter@@ actions are crossed , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to define a output file immediately . you can do this step later at saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set the options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you would not want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board . in the open dialog you will need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the breaking button .
you can also arrange to@@ es and query : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall over a reference window .
which idea is behind ? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions . if you would like to figure out these features , that would have to create two corresponding files , they would need to copy two corresponding files . now you can copy the relevant sections simply , then add and compare these functions .
note : currently you can remove nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the all @-@ step text is supported in a reference window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and dis@@ assembling of text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window lies the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that windows C is optional . ) Each Info has to rest a while on line . then a small utility window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees the color which differs in . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well .
in addition to the text , the connection column is displayed . if differences were found , the color shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful only to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + + , are white characters only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processors and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the abstra@@ ction column from the text , is interrupted in the digits , where the source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line is displayed in broken lines .
the results window ( below the reference window ) also has an Info @-@ line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you handled the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use kno@@ bs jumps to the next / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference at the same time has to be resolved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is indicated . this group will then be highlighted at the beginning of the group . ) This batch is then highlighted the current group . it will be highlighted by the color background color for the current section and on the left hand appears a black beams .
sometimes you have left the automatic crash or do no more line in the group ; then there is only one space holder for the case that you may change your opinion and maybe yet another source . this text appears not in the final stored file , nor in a mark that you may copy and add elsewhere .
the text &amp; paste ; coll@@ usion layer ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the window window . do c@@ auti@@ ous with this function .
note : if in selecting the sources the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ red C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
this will navigate mainly with the picture @-@ run and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons left , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ sight column in addition to the vertical frame bar can be used by clicking on the navigation .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to work with the insertion mode . ( default is set @-@ in mode . )
a button with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective Group ( as already in the section together and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / ancient conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l picture ) or to the next / last un@@ solved conflicts could continue to be considered as conflict . therefore , there must be differences between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you have to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insertion ) . if this is enabled , the option is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copying . be careful with this option but you could acci@@ dentally copy the contents of the clip@@ board .
connections are saved according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants are using a line feed unit \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car back @-@ feed + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ sch@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not ret@@ ains the sources of source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not with binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and rest@@ oring in the next start . ( menu entries &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog has variable width with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences in curve sequences are displayed . if the selected script does not support this representation doesn &apos;t happen anymore .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be sc@@ aled automatically . on these systems the button settings automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
if this option is enabled , pressing the tab button to insert the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you enter input or return , the inclusion of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , you will automatically copy any selection into the clip@@ board . then copy the manual into the clip@@ board .
you can choose which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to save . the default value is the common choice on the used operating system .
when comparing files on the same files , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; first , all identical lines can be igno@@ red in source files . the second step compar@@ es white characters . the second step compar@@ es white characters . in this step , white signs will not ignore white characters .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , other again save only a line feed card &apos; \ &apos; . usually igno@@ res &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; however , if this option is enabled , they are disabled with different sizes in side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but like a white characters . during this option , this option has to be disabled . in the default , this option is disabled .
the default option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are igno@@ red . the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
the default option is disabled . changes in comments are dealt with white characters .
inten@@ sely after even smaller down@@ stairs . the option is enabled in the default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly for very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically St@@ ill @-@ Run mode , this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is passed before the next un@@ solved conflict is passed .
if you need automatically , if white characters are used as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you require white characters in many files . please note that the automatic selection also includes conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ red C / C + + comment .
these options will be explained in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a mer@@ ging . look for details below document @-@ comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already a older version exists , then the original version is suff@@ ix .@@ original hung . if already a such back@@ log file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . the changing of this option does not refer to the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete and rest@@ art to change the change . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally across the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if one activ@@ ates this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
in the selection dialog for encoding a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as coding for each file can be adjusted individually , can be compared with different encoding and can be merged .
in case you have mach@@ ined a file , you can define what encoding should be used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your codec . ( for example , your files could deal with 16 @-@ bit ASCII ) with this option one can set the coding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
switch off immediately to supp@@ ress the high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are igno@@ red or igno@@ red C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a colour coded Cross@@ ing column are displayed . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . according to the selection of A &amp; B ; -@@ s ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ s ; C will be displayed next to the normal , a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space for long lines . you simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window by side or over@@ l@@ apping . this option can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files together . a simple click brings together the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as the pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to run the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will hand over this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ set , which corresponds to your needs . you can use this function such as removable parts or to correct adjustment .
when reading a file it will be referred to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the edition of the command is used only when using this template . you can write your own pre@@ set , which corresponds to your needs . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind this is to enable users more flexibility to setup the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most user would like to program the good news . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ outs to convert the input in upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;@@ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This is an erg@@ ent expression on any character string , and in this connection , all characters in one line refers to the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ s@@ few . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to include automatic keywords : \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you might get to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar items .
the igno@@ red numbers are actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line ab@@ normal@@ ities . SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a matches , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several variants at one time . then , you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the goals of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; Ho@@ wever , if SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs only , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor are kept for the display and to merge . the other operations change only the data that sees the line @-@ down algorithm .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ o @-@ Pre@@ v is the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t see acci@@ dentally particular differences and destroy in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers must edit many files in one folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before departure ,
... can sim@@ ulate the interaction and displays the sim@@ ulated changes to do without it .
... select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and mer@@ ging of individual files . you need to specify only folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders can be merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination is specified , use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not lead the interaction . to initi@@ ate the interaction , select the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
during the reading of the folder you will inform you a small news window on current progress . when you break down the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
when scanning the folder is finished , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and any folder that was found in the Scan can be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the file structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or to the object buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions , all sub@@ directories can open , where you can open all folders or fold .
when you click on a file , the file will start the file and it appears a reference window .
the icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type of file type is different from the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the cl@@ ut@@ hr action can not be chosen automatically . if the merger is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown above the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
files are considered identical when their complete content is identical . then you have the same color . when folders , the age is un@@ considerable for his color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tive data types . as long as such fl@@ aw objects exist , the mer@@ ging can &apos;t be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tive data types . as long as such fl@@ aw objects exist , the mer@@ ging can &apos;t be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target file are given and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action will be identical to that both folders . if you select one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result into two folders . ( the user looks like the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders can be combined and the option new file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) activ@@ ates &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and traces the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging can &apos;t be started .
while mer@@ ging a file is executed one file after the others . a status @-@ column shows fer@@ rous when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected . if the merger is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is fine .
if the text dialog is chosen for a complete analysis of complete analysis , it will show diff@@ 3 other columns . these include the number of un@@ for@@ ter , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ uble conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or combined . )
you can select either the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the cl@@ ut@@ hr actions ( even in all sub @-@ folders ) , you can run the interaction .
note : if you have no destination file , then the three @-@ folder conver@@ se mode C is used as target , when two @-@ folder conver@@ se will be used as target and when synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed at the destination , even in the file structure . there are some options to over@@ pass the certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . in order to merge only the current entry , choose the current element , or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still inv@@ alid merge actions exist , a message appears that indicates def@@ ective items . you can choose a valid promotion for them .
if you come together all the entries , a dialog window appears with the options to perform sim@@ ulate and vom@@ iting .
select Sim@@ ulation if you would like to see what would happen , without which really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge of a single file ) , then a cl@@ ining window will open ( observe the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , choose the directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list see some error messages that you should start to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you continue with the interaction .
if some entries have been merged individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and does not lead them again . even if the merge operation has been changed or not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you have the interaction action , these entries will be re@@ group@@ ed once again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory entry with these options :
only files that are shown on the printed pattern are displayed in the element tree . they can be entered into the element tree . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp . * .@@ h ) . the default file is * . file must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as partition . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders correspond to this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as partition . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that will be igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ op@@ mat@@ ically created files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder was file specific using a .@@ c@@ v@@ Sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ Sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attri@@ bute . in other file systems select a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default settings .
with links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links indicate . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links are treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively sear@@ ches . ( note that a link to a folder on itself ) would lead to a final loop and ( &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is switched off at the default location .
results in a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ com@@ modities , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when they contain files on files . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare great folders through a slow network , it is possibly faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed limit costs you however a certain level of safety . please note with caution . this option is due in the default setting .
similar to the change date . there &apos;s no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical when they are equal to . i.e. , such can be useful when copying the change date . please note with caution . this option is checked in the default setting .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folders . in this mode , the proposals are identical to that . even the results from the mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is displayed in the default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered to be uns@@ af@@ e , because the other file is not changed also . ) This option is displayed in default . ) This option is displayed in the default location .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version is renamed and will get the extension .@@ original If an old backup file with the .@@ original button already exists , this will also affect the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging all folders . this option is enabled in the default settings .
normally , the folder mer@@ ging view would be visible to the interaction of individual files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the folder &amp; text window , the main window will divide the window in the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably , you prefer a file simply to compare with double @-@ click menu . however , there is a single file also to merge into the merge menu . once you save the folder , the status will be done to the merge and the file will not be merged when you start folder .
this status is however lost when you read the directory once again : directory menu : new read
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax than local files and folders . some Things should be aware of :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file containing the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system , sometimes through the protocol used , there is a short list of constra@@ ints :
or it can not be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder . then a file is accepted as link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( please note the option of the size . ) ( This is only for local files possible . )
the main purpose of use is currently used as the differences of the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always start the built @-@ in differences of diff@@ user . to display K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences of the viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part view from the context menu .
normally , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as K@@ Part , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; on that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program then starts to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can select a patch file and choose from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if does not work the original files . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since production of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part 1 , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ is the pre@@ pare ) already exists . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use the GPL programs very long and have learned a lot to look into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers that have gone this path or let him go .
you have probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . pre@@ ference installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e. g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters vary , these lines will also be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is treated differently , the line will not be identical . if V@@ Lines ! next to Each other , this is the case of this p@@ is .
the Editor refers to any difference in files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could save that information .
the effort was so far too large . you can use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to handle larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , no sr@@ c lin@@ s ; it appeared and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ish . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?

only differences show : files that are identical in all folders , and therefore do not appear on the folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you must re @-@ read the folder with the function of updates )
only entries are displayed , the differences may have . this also causes that identical files when mer@@ ging can &apos;t be copied to the target folder . if the target folder will not change these files .

note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already available ) , if the lines are already available , clicking on the button once again .
the default option is disabled ; the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ show of all virtual work@@ places . it &apos;s quite convenient to see the ongoing programmes running on the work surfaces , to change its size , or move it . this works both within a desktop and at several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in running . applications can be selected and even be moved to the desktop and to others .
with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other surfaces .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen size . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen saver , such as would you read at the newspaper read a magni@@ fier for different users : these include artists , web @-@ designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as magni@@ fication window . the picture that appears in the magni@@ fication window is a enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as selection window .
in the standard settings can be enlarged and k@@ ish ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter looks like an mov@@ eable lap . alternatively , you can get a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the surrounding of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen edge ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the extended window , select the mouse poin@@ ter in the extended window , please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouth buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fication window and move it with the arrow buttons .
if you also press the &amp; Shift ; press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . keep in mind that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain and only the lower right corner is left .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert a file in the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the stops of the update brings that the required CPU time is against 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , high ) . the higher the Update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically extract your selected short commands to save files , opening a new window , Print , Ne@@ ul@@ aden ( with the button document once again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and Ver@@ sm@@ allen &amp; etc ; .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fying glass in order to use a magni@@ fying image in a newspaper or a photo . this application is intended for various people of benefits : from research or artists to the website or handic@@ apped people .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it &apos;s meant to help people suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( det@@ on@@ itive strain @-@ strain attacks ) and of which any mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain of the panel ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and that each mouse is em@@ ulate with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which arises during the click of mouse and helps to use so many people who are caused without pain . unfortunately , you suffer from painful manifest@@ ation because of your computer . unfortunately , you should call a doctor if this is not yet done .
to clari@@ fy it even though : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; p@@ ains avoid p@@ ains that are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which are caused by the mouse due to the mouse . and as with all ergonomic options , the result can vary depending on the mouse .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and leads a mouse click away once you break the movement short .
if the intelligent move activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , until the end of the mouse , it will wait until the end of the mouse button . in this way you can move the pulling in pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires little exercise , but you get used to get used .
this account time must go after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click leads .
if it &apos;s turned on , the rotation field is switched off ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is shut down , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will wait , before the mouse is waiting to get rid of the mouse , if there is no use due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is enabled by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , one click with right mouse button . a slow motion to the left and back , followed by a button . these movements are recorded in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , they can be changed later .
if the sound is del@@ ays , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider &apos;s gener@@ el . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can reduce the response times to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently available under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please refer to the respective documentation as you start a program .
sets all settings on the values set down when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button to use the settings , the settings will be reset to the state after pressing the user .
best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent shi@@ fting should first be switched off . if you click to the automatic mouse click , you can remove the intelligent shi@@ fting .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; if you have to decrease .
first you should make sure to do a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral density of windows or on digits in the browser window that doesn &apos;t display link , leads not to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore use the mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is jer@@ ky , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the cast@@ ors that come into contact with the mouse .
first you must take out the mouse ball . like this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of your mouse .
if you have removed the sphere , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and so@@ iling can be scrat@@ ched by a sh@@ allow blade or the fing@@ ern@@ es .
in very rare situations , the operating system boots the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you just use the intelligent move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot be ending over the lot of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move it into a window .
the solution for this problem exists in that you can run a mouse click . this is due to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; set aside and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , trying to execute &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the cur@@ sor position and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to have . but park the mouse on a neutral sphere of mind when you &apos;re going to make a key action . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the tit@@ le@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shi@@ fting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit the text .
the intelligent move is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you get to move it into the clip@@ board , to move it into the clip@@ board , where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but there will probably be some problems with you . here are some advice about this :
do not use the intelligent shipping if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use this text instead as follows : perform the switch pressed while using a mouse button at the end of the text , while you move the mouse button at the other end of the text and re@@ comp@@ ute the mouse button once again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this allows you to retri@@ eve a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when in the smart shi@@ fting the shi@@ fting time begins . later you can use the smart shi@@ fting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but do you need it for some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed in most cases .
the audi@@ ble mouse functionality is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker and are set up properly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; put the mouse button once the mouse poin@@ ter shortly after the mouse poin@@ ter . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and who prepar@@ es the f@@ ath@@ ing of the mouth keys .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as it is a certain time for waiting that a pulling process begins , before the mouse is released . in this way , the dra@@ g@@ ging and shut@@ ting can be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows users to talk to your computer for itself .
with the &amp; k@@ mouth program ; you can choose the computer to speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the sentences that should once again be spoken .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which later is used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book manual . from the text@@ books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) you determine the dic@@ tionary documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can read the word lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ Dictionary making it just a letter words into the word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly structured and contains essentially a input field for the keyboard lay@@ outs of your propositions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a running memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you register k@@ mouth ; properly set , you can choose the sets that you want to listen . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can choose from it sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... Open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two cart@@ ons , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ vol@@ ution and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box language voice example , enter the command to enter the language code . in the selection box below the input field , set the character encoding , using the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to speech output from your language generator . this command you will find in documentation to your language generator . examples for this you can find in App@@ endix .
if you need to pass as language service as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings are available for voice output , which is currently being developed by SV@@ N . option of this option is meaning@@ ful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selection of a text passage you will determine which action will be triggered by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the bodies for text@@ books .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the selected text passage is spoken directly and in addition to the inserted memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered initially only in the input field .
with the second selection box Sch@@ shut@@ ting the handling window for text@@ book manual , you can determine if the text of the text settings can be stored automatically at the closing of the setup window .
with the selection of text check@@ book manual , the book is stored . if you have any changes , the text@@ book manual is not stored . choose to store , &amp; k@@ mouth shall ask if the text@@ book book is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ge@@ vity contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection dialog when this list includes more than a dic@@ tionary . using this selection box you can choose the currently used dic@@ tionary to the word .
with the buttons to the right on the page you can change dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the language on the text and select the language for the dic@@ tionary .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by checking the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word list using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dic@@ tionary to include only true words written into the new dic@@ tionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries must be merged and how it shall be turned .
with this option , you will create a new , empty dic@@ tionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth . re@@ created automatically in the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary in the course of time .
the main field of the window for the processing of text applications is divided into two . in the upper section the text@@ books are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective button . if you have selected a text@@ book book , you can only change its name .
some actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a hing@@ ed menu .
the sequence of text@@ books or text passages can be changed through gyp@@ sum with the mouse to the new site or with the arrow keys and the keys and Alt ; key change .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if the input field is selected , the text is used , otherwise the selected areas of the run storage .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if the input field is selected , the text is used , otherwise the selected areas of the run storage .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text in the input field is used , this is used otherwise the selected propositions of the run storage .
this menu entry is crossed and will be displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default on the menu window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the f@@ ooth@@ ed left side and pulling the tool bar to another site .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow spr@@ int in the lower part of the main window with views over the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar is b@@ lown .
this menu entry is crossed and is displayed with entries in text settings with entries . the strip is arranged by default on the processing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the f@@ ooth@@ ed left side and pulling the tool bar to another site .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output not correct or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice message language . ( see Settings dialog for Language Syn@@ thesizer ) .
the festival is a language output system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , you are only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch . the license allows to use the festival for free and distributed without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the setting of speech output , it is believed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / Festival . the command to speech is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an integrated &amp; Java generator . currently , it supports only the English translation language . currently , it supports only the English translation language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and distributed without restrictions .
in order to show the command line for the establishment of speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ t . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following command :
for the third example , option data must be switched on . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of Phon@@ &apos;s into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ close the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to see the last character of the text so that an additional sign must be changed . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ated than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / m@@ ys@@ a / / usr / local / / usr / local / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / f.@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sh@@ ay / f.@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / f.@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / f.@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / f.@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option data must be switched on .
the speech output d@@ us@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ next language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
as setting the language setting , only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as tickets as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setting up the page K@@ TT@@ SD language support , which is displayed in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you really need a voice generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual from your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application where people who cannot speak , text through the computer can display . a list has already been saved , which the user can re @-@ launch again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not a voice syn@@ thesizer . on your computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or rest@@ art your help center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is an array of modules existing , which allows for each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ u ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . also the user offers interesting options .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the Text Editor &amp; Kate ; , also if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; c@@ de ; -@@ applications embedded .
the speech output is performed via the program disper@@ sion , the various background program such as the peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables creation of language editions to the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus service programme .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; one application without visible windows , offering the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ;
one application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr@@ in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the Text Editor &amp; Kate ; in which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org / ) you can subscribe to the list about ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / email / info @ k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also find in I@@ RC ( r@@ c.@@ k@@ de.@@ org , Channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you have to use &amp; kt@@ on ; you need to install and set the program file disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr@@ as or as long as there are not yet speakers , the cart@@ board card is indicated . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the cart@@ card will be displayed in General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , such as various male or female , or such that distinguish themselves in volume or speed . you should also use several variants for syn@@ thes@@ izers , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is used as spokes@@ person before you use &amp; dict@@ ate ; since the program speed lim@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard loudspeaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printer expect@@ ation for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ card re@@ iter spokes@@ person in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the cart@@ board card will be displayed automatically , if you rest@@ art car m@@ gr and still not furnished any speaker .
all the best speakers are published in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the best spokes@@ man is used for voice output when an application does not have any speaker .
with a mouse click a present@@ er out of the list , and click on this button to remove the present@@ er from the list .
with a mouse click a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click a present@@ er out of the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list is also determined by their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
please choose a m@@ ist type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girls agree to choose from .
for example , if you click here , the new spokes@@ person on the board map nar@@ rator . in order to change the settings of this spokes@@ man , click Edit .
you can now use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can now almost use either . go back to the map tab , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; please click to read text to create text messages . see the card for map orders to manage and manage text messages . see .
for example , if you have at least one speaker system , you can also start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the board card reader to open this map card . here you can set some general options here .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts the card ticket orders , and you can create text applications and you can read text messages . see . remove the marking , will get K@@ TT@@ SD and get off the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr@@ is terminated , &amp; kt@@ ts is running ; continue on , if the box speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr@@ à appears in the area of the control bar , it van@@ ishes once once the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start reading text applications , stop , stop and pick up again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board can be read or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click on users or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card can only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map of the box General and enable language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . then check the text that should be read , and select the main menu tool@@ kit . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always meaning@@ ful to select the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step forward , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing and other invisible stamps also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text editor . then check the text that should be read before . then select the text that should be read , and select the main menu tool@@ kit . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative ; .
K@@ emer@@ gen@@ ds is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which notify you of the specified events . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; dict@@ ts ; read .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC programme of &amp; k@@ de ; you can setup different types of messages . you can read &amp; conversation ; for example , if you submit a message in an I@@ RC channel you can read a message in which your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; kt@@ u , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ with@@ stands , a menu entry is displayed in the menu settings of this program . here , the possible settings for K@@ emer@@ gen@@ cies differ according to application .
filter for drawing control offer a good way to correct &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . you can remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can send k@@ mail , and additionally the expression / local / In@@ box , since that in most cases can be assumed . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; rec@@ ts ; . for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not necessary .
in fil@@ tering the text will be edited , before it is sent to the program of disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations to select a proper language and nar@@ rator or to deal certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Movie @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text , distingu@@ ishes among four types of texts .
the output of Screen re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be written to all other applications and will keep these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is pre @-@ read , orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and holds the edition of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
they have the next top priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that &apos;s messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you can just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news . read .
the rest are simple text applications . each order that you hit from the card map orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that are used for text applications . text applications are thought for the issu@@ ing long texts that have no specific ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in qu@@ eu@@ es , except the output of Screen re@@ aders . if an application sends out the output of a screen reader , during &amp; rec@@ ts ; just such a prec@@ reads , this edition will hold and finished .
first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen re@@ aders . they will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and give it to the next filters . currently there are three kinds of filters .
filters are executed as modules . there are still further types of filters in the future .
drawing board replacing parts of a text by other text . these parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . it will be delivered to either words or as regular expres@@ sions as : - ) by text or for the format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or by mail ; or , in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ formers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) um &amp; XML ; generated by a format into another format . delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; are contained some X@@ SL@@ T files to translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with talk tra@@ ders you can send orders dependent on the content of text or subject ; sent to a speaker . if you have sent a female voice to the card , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can read about it .
each of these different filters can be applied in accordance with which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter stip@@ ulates that his rules cannot be found , the text remains unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ click on &amp; kt@@ ert ; it is processed by all activated fil@@ tering that were set up on the page down@@ ward . the processing by the filters are displayed in the sequence from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished standard filter . if a filter does not cross , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be shi@@ fted from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . choose the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following introduc@@ tory dial@@ ogs .
for setting up character filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison chart . then the text is exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and small hin@@ ts is not given in comparison .
enter your name for your fil@@ tering a name . you can choose to choose the name of the other filters only from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaced it in accordance with the character string from the column . the list is executed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file to delete the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is listed here , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages . click on the button to show a list of languages if you hold down the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button click here .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separated by comm@@ it@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the user ID running programs is provided with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers have to be we@@ aving . if you have an example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; use the user ID @-@ 34@@ 32 as an example , you can only enter kop@@ p .
the string support filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the kit can apply . if all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character disc filters use regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guide to the writing of regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; download &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions in the package clearly .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ations . but it can only be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the spokes@@ man optional filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define the texts by e @-@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text on the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen by the subject of the speaker that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; and the features of the speaker systems can be selected . with the speaker selection filter , you can re@@ sign the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the listed regular expression . it is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this with a click on the button to help assistance in the input .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor off the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the required speaker systems . if the text meets the requirements of the filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements . click on the button right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or delete your camera settings or delete all settings .
the speaker indi@@ an filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the kit can apply . if necessary , you have to pay at least a condition .
the language output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; used to give the programmer to their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD language syn@@ thesizer , so that a syn@@ thesizer can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of speech output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / p@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .

here is text of the text to read and option a voice code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start only on a window , then kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr@@ in the other .
not one of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ izers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter set up , but when using the module there are websites not pre @-@ read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so if you do not use this voice to read from websites . in addition , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found via the installation variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain character or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause error in syn@@ thesizer , so that all propositions are over@@ wi@@ ped or only Kau@@ der@@ ma . what can I do against it ?
in addition , make sure that the character encoding is set to the right language for the respective language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a dra@@ fting tile filter . see .

the language syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you can find in the corresponding documentation or the relevant Websites . there are also voices who own own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE Source Code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will find it in the folder . in addition , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ gu@@ .@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mi@@ de / .

KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of the above mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , you draw the description of the syn@@ thesizer among the supported languages ( see also on the website ) ; , according information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; Use @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers . if you would like to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; use the development team in touch with the development team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages and the Developer Files for the program &quot; Official disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you purchase the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; referring to the source code for k@@ de@@ fre@@ t or to download the program created every night , please install and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; dict@@ ate ; use , check first if the dispute can work correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . this allows you to use the Sh@@ ell@@ il@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ u ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program of the state @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher uses . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is to be developed so that the setup of state @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is not required and the script SPD @-@ conf is not needed anymore .
a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can go on or off ver@@ ts , repeat the output or break the output .
if you have an application text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; however , an application can request a female speaker for the output . if you have female speaker , the language is English and whose sex is female , otherwise it will be automatically the best suitable speaker . if you want more about it , you will see how &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will see you in .
when you click on the map &apos;s card speaker to add , and to add a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card card speaker facility will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details about the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the extensive festival program . when the path to the festival is P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter here .
select the character string for text that will be handed to the festival . by votes the &amp; kt@@ ops ; it will be automatically done that Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der , you adjust volume , speaker speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a regulator and display this grey , the chosen voice can not be displayed by you .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be charged . if you select this check box , these votes will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first movement will be faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have any speaker furnished ( or have to click on users ) . see .
if this check box is marked at the start of kt@@ ts@@ .@@ gr the program window is displayed , but otherwise the program window is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr@@ it doesn &apos;t see , appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD writes a text . this allows you to read or refine your way .
here are all orders in the qu@@ eu@@ e used , together with the application submitted to the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the precisely processed proposition . the speaker ID is equivalent to the board card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can start a couple in the order , which is selected in the list below , or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click OK , all the changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map tab . see also .
there are only text applications listed and manages . issues of Screen re@@ aders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ u ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , it can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install AL@@ SA , select the PCM tool here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately the double standard microphone speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ x have to be installed .
click on users to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , please choose Standard .
on this map card you can always establish special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language applications :
the output of Screen re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other applications and will keep these orders . after the output of the screen saver has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the edition of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the warning .
news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that &apos;s messages out . if you &amp; eg . just a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; yet someone welcome you just enter the room .
will create a text order through a message , warning or issue of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the maintenance @-@ long one .
this audio file will then be played , if a normal text order is interrupted . if the introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as an introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map card only apply to normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of screen re@@ aders , there are no particular actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority .
to be able to read with &amp; kt@@ ach@@ ts ; start reading and click al@@ er@@ ts . the board map noti@@ fications will appear .
mark this check box to activate the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ abling exec@@ utions . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; rec@@ ts ; reads no al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ er@@ ts , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on button 1 , a dialog appears where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the news before , the &amp; conversation ; sent if som@@ ebody comes in an I@@ RC message to your nick@@ name .
all events , which is noted in the list , are igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do when an event hits . you have the following options :
if you have chosen user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can also enter the properties of the required spokes@@ man . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is indicated in the list on card card speaker as the top of the card .
note that there are three levels for events . it is executed for a certain event of a specific application , the action will run out . otherwise , the action will run for all other events of specific application . the last possibility is to carry out the action to carry out the standard ( all other events ) .
the event All Not@@ ices of Application Standard ( any other events cannot be deleted from the list ) for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button to save the settings to save the al@@ er@@ ts to a file . currently loaded settings are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except all the disabled .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice message . this standard contains trademarks for controlling the voices , the volume , the gender number and pitch . in addition , brands for controlling the language of e.g. ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ u ; SS@@ ML only partially only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since it is the standard vote for the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or audio situation in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is regulated , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked M@@ om Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear ind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and Sat@@ is@@ borders filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start reading , because only the first proposition must be credited , not the whole text order . thus , you can also go back on the map ticket orders , or stop and stop , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ izers are not directly supported .
here you see the bound@@ ary filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is automatically set up as a for@@ warding of the sound ampli@@ fication filter . you can change its settings or add another set lim@@ it@@ ability filters , but in@@ mates will not use it .
in the sim@@ pl@@ est , you will learn the setup of intercom selection and give text to the pre @-@ read . check out the speaker selection once again , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed . in addition , you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then , faster with the preview can start , since only the first movement can be processed , and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you will then hold text applications on the map card , or termin@@ ate it even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal Sat@@ is@@ borders filter will automatically set up if you can not switch for the first time . it can not be removed only . do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; one module for the &amp; k@@ control center , which enables the management of network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center , allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center can be accessed by selecting the K Menu k@@ control@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center is displayed ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selection of k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be able to install and configure , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device ever displays and adjust the settings of the network characteristics .
in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are install on installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings can be loaded , if the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ index is selected to automatically detect the used platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be detected , the board selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release date . by selecting the setting non @-@ again questions , the definition can be met permanently . during next start of network settings , this selection will automatically default to default .
changing the network settings can be displayed only in system management mode . previously , all options can be considered , the settings can be considered only visible . in system management mode the settings can be viewed at the right end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password mode .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode , which is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the rider network interfaces can be performed by the following tasks :
the settings of the network interfaces can be setup by selecting the desired tool in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box will be addressed .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to view the dialog with further ways .
with the option of automation , TCP / IP settings are brought from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP servers . in addition , the TCP / IP information system sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual may be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be set . in the input field network mask is the sub@@ net@@ mask set .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alized the network interface in bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog appears as the properties of the device in the box list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would result into a TCP / IP conflict . using ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the default address is already being asked .
network devices can be switched on or off on demand . switching to an integrated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be switched on or off on demand . switch off of an activated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
the IP address of the machine is fixed in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ networks .
if your computer is more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected to the network where the gateway is selected .
one machine with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only can only understand IP addresses . if computers are only IP addresses . if computers are only IP addresses , it dis@@ solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the quest@@ rian name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be removed , removed or modified on@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract and up or down in the list with the buttons up or down in the priority .
by clicking the button ... from the group computer to name resolution can be added a DNS server . it will add the New name server dialog .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Adding . the entry will then be added to the list .
from the group computer to select the name resolution you choose a entry and then click on the button .... It will be the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address settings for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
normally the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will still support . this still requires the current version of IP in future 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The dialog New alias is displayed .
to enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press comm@@ enting several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well known host from the list and choose Be@@ ing .... The dialog for Modern calcul@@ ator is displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then click OK to update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the order must be set in one &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the newest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm pack@@ ets ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool with graphical user can be used as a package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development box with libraries and libraries are needed .
this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should aff@@ ord .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is outlined , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; binary configuration files will be discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network are convey@@ ed .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 has never found large spread . IPv6 is expected to go through the near future . this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign network drives , at &amp; eg . workplace is the network administrator the response time , which is available to a valid IP address , or if it is available , the IP address can be selected as arbitr@@ arily .
when putting an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from an especially reserved area for this purpose , to avoid IP address lines with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting up a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , the addresses are usually used in the 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are connected to the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route is required for the IP @-@ forward line .
the address address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local press . usually the address is 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in several distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed to DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections a other content than specified there .
for &amp; SuSE Linux , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can be found as expected .

before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the insured files . this can be done on three ways :
choose a file or folder in the local file tree . it &apos;s only assured that file or folder .
mark a safety profile in a tree . only those are backed up in the profile specified files .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
as soon as the backup was derived , the dialog for backup is opened . in this dialog you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to f@@ use the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archive and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection once and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check this dialog . this dialog shows the progress of the examination as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ produce the re@@ produce , the files you need to be recovered . this may take place on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive . it will only be re @-@ produced the selected file or folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are recovered .
click with the right mouse button to select a file or folder in one of the archive and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process was started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialogue you can check your selection once and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears re@@ produce . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the inde@@ xed file using the band file using the tape image . this process will delete all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
a safety profile with the straight selected files and the default settings are created . you can also make the following settings for a security profile :
the current work folder where the backup should take place . the list of the c@@ auti@@ ous files will be updated automatically according to the chosen working folder .
for all folders that are under backup files , only the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . file that can be found on other file systems . each entry is deleted by t@@ ar regardless of the other file systems .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used for setting the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
remove the snap@@ shot file from the call from t@@ ar . this causes that all the files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files are broken ; and lt ; files are not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be setup via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can make you :
the complete path for the tape drive for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must be seen on the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is mounted , the command is mounted to the drive . some of the drives can be performed before reading or writing operations .
if the option is switched on , you tried &amp; dat ; the throw at the tape drive . possibly this setting is not working with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when trig@@ gers the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band is automatically exposed ; use this option not at Flo@@ ppy @-@ stre@@ amer .
if the option is switched on , you tried &amp; dat ; the hardware @-@ specific block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to log &amp; v@@ dat ; in any case the log size for your belt runs .
if &amp; dat ; a band is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only a memory block on the volume . the file &apos;s content is composed as follows :
( N byte ) The volume ID . the format of this sequence is the computer name : seconds , whereby the computer name is the complete name of the system , on which the volume has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the time has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to use a file containing the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar -@@ archives that are directly integrated with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar to manage . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it does not have to incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a band is mounted .
&amp; B log@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is for in@@ experienced users , or where you can obtain information on your system , or where the system allows information about your system , or where the system allows for quick access to information about problems related to their server .
&amp; b system log ; helps users to understand what your calcul@@ ator is in the background . the task is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system sends the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ cutter log ; experienced users have access to information about problems appearing on their server . I try to provide some enhanced features that will be filtered and evaluated using the protocol of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; ks@@ cutter log ; a number of useful functions . these include amongst others :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included , and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ b log ; features available , with their help , the individual protocol lines of a protocol file are easy to filter and sort ; the individual options for s@@ orting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; B log@@ log log ; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not appear , and it will run out of its system administrator right . the protocol files will normally be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user to have no authorization to read .
you can also use the filter bar to fil@@ tering the fil@@ tering system according to the selected filter system . in the default setting , the selection box contains the entry settings all . then a protocol line is displayed only when in one of the columns contain the strings of the filter search term .
you can also select another entry at this point . select the character string of the filter search phr@@ ase in the corresponding column . in the protocol , select the name of the process , and carry out the log log ; all the protocol lines , which were sent or compiled by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you recognize the key protocol lines . Protocol lines of the Level Error are displayed with a show@@ y colour as a protocol @-@ rows of the stage . display lines can be switched to setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in system protocol or in cr@@ on Protocol ) , you can then be able to check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the To new lines in the context menu of the master window to view all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; B log@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . in order to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows , select a protocol from the menu to display .
&amp; B log@@ log ; has its own website in ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ b log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the source &apos;s control system log ; .
you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ _ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program starts at the start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; it is because it is easier to use , powerful and much more flexible than the traditional BSD content .
I &apos;m not going to enter into historical aspects ( such as I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone may try to implement a machine on System V In@@ it without creating a re@@ installation and new format . therefore you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also distingu@@ ishes itself from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other file :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a lot of scripts . basically , you need to run a script for each system service which you want to run at the start of the system or change onto another run@@ level . system services include such things such as offset , NFS , &amp; shipping ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such items such as set@@ serial that is only started . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ c@@ c.@@ d should lie if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is actually not much use for this . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the standard run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point , you can throw at a glance into the second column and probably real@@ ise that the pre @-@ set round level 3 is done . if you want to change this , then you can fix your / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . if you have somewhat conf@@ used , then come to rest@@ art it by rest@@ art the system and run the following :
but how does it begin to enter all the proper scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that no real files are located in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to a scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? easy : each of the scripts are written so that there is a argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts in action by hand on the command line as follows :
this would read the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one K includes , the script will be called off . if it includes an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could &amp; go ; a server @-@ Run@@ level , that can run only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; ship@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I also could have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to tri@@ vial . simply drag one entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six rounds to start at this level ( or stop ) .
you can move a script from Run@@ lev@@ eling or modify the position within a level by moving it anywhere . in this way , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they pull out a entry from the availability of available system services .
note : entries are moved to move in a new area . in order to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must simply select copying from the menu item and then add in the target area -- even then , when the same entry has already exists in the target range of the action .
the s@@ orting number one can &apos;t be calculated sometimes . in such a case you will need to edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the modified entries before trying to insert the system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore entries , which have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to enable the various working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection above or below the previous data .
to move one entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut out into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired round level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the number or names of this entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . connect the dialog button to accept the dialog button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ern the changes .
due to the danger of data loss all entries in the menu file would require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / Trigger / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) are taken if they are available from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise , changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve tried with the standard run@@ lev@@ elling , and now the machine will be new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; available under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions .
the type , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for the propri@@ etary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan a extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution list , please verify whether all configuration files are required ( and even if they are located in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message if their configuration files are not available or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be from version to version differently . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you will need to save them . either use the respective icon of tool@@ bar or entry Save In menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user and user user ranking . to the edit , select the wanted user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user and group characteristics .
some boxes can only be displayed if you have enlarged system settings . only if you have allowed restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , it will appear to make individual settings . other cards appear , if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD uniform .
the card card fits , if shadow pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed in BSD uni@@ x .
this card card is only activated , if required for at least one embedded file system limits ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( can be seen at the quoted quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change the limits for each user parameters in KB .
these parameters can be set individually for any file system . the current file system will be selected by means of the field file system with space limitation .
the map groups informs about the group of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field of prim@@ itive group . furthermore , the user can join in other groups by marking these in the large field .
the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , adding from the menu user or group or click the matching add @-@ button of the tool bar . the editing or del@@ eting of the selected user or the selected group is analogue .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove operating systems , change and more .
