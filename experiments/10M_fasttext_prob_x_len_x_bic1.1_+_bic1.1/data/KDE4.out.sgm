<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your storage location. if you are plenty of photos on the same place. if you are plenty of photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will not be organise to organise your content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the split of file types makes stacking processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store metadata into & digious; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget, then you can subsequently select the metadata from the database in the files by clicking the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? add & digious; add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, as you should select every photo sign, labels, and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that will require the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's go with keyboards, keywords, how to proceed with other programs frequent, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import the cataloged images from a different source with embedded keyboards, then add & digious; automatically add the images to the correct place. setting up the hierarchy within the building is no problem and can simply be done by the drag of a sub-tree to another. the changed phrases came from & digious; updated while they are tracked away.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata. this is a very large representation, because each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the words - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalogze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to watch most nies your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. from afar off is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the landing site of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream with associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even listen to the silence of this panoramic position.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos, the title is probably more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. if you should show a story, it is the meaning of the viewer to help Him beyond the motive you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can also save as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), and you can even create a spell checker. if you export your pictures in web galleries, these labels will be able to tell you about the label and / or the title of web-gallery. you need to tell the story so for the opening of a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before google Earth? good, because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities are using the Geolocalization. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can simply repeat that you can open your voort by using images with geographical details. you can also download the photos at the recording location. you can also download the pictures by using Google Earth, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. can you export your Google Earth viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on distribution and changing of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for working others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you that the information should be stored in the setup page of & digious; as information, the information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and Writer): this field should add your name or the name of the photographer, for example to protect the name of the photographer, such as the name of the photographer, then it cannot be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as a partition.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autolitel (Synonym for Writers Line): linked with the author. this field contains the work designation of the photographer. examples for this, photographer, freelancer photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonymous for suppliers): do not use the provider button to identify which the photo will be. if the photographer is working here for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then you can download the image here. if the image is a bearing photo, then the image will be displayed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against misuse. anyone has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can be delete or change. the solution for this problem are digital water characters. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in one picture. & digiplug; in the near future, a module for stacking processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, plate loss, streamlining, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, life time, temperature, data size, widespread aberration</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs you lost on the streets or fire. these kind of losses are the same those who can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">'roll Ontrack, the biggest data-recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated and you can't go longer than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. there are offers of Gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that would have a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your peeling space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices, and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest properties, but you are much reliable, but you can select the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors, even if you have just written only. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they need for chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust and etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a convenient program called IsoBuster's apparently works on CDs and Linux, but is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to capture the format of the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything is said of course also for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good admission device to high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. also, if you should place the media using a description, date & author license and thereafter at a clean, dark dry and before animals protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can interpret these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your statistics for itself. your manufacturers guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study about trouble shooting of hard drives: dismissing the disks</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks will hold the longest fault rate in the temperature range between 35 ° C and 45 ° C. The fault rate can not determine the most frequent error correction, SMART can not notice these errors immediately. these are especially readers and publishers. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you saved the files, but these losses are usually able to restore any large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices accumulates not much, these can take heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high-speed process. these can cause severe damage, hardware alterations, hardware reports and other defects. thus protecting motherboards and other defects. protect themselves from inevitable that causes a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is a part of the energy saving is absorbed and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in. but remember that any plug-in bar contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that it satisfies the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a particular minimum of protection. you should also ensure that he protects protection against lightning.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use each cable to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripherals are connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems. some manufacturers provide overvoltage support for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed especially for Notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection of the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While the overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the current lines it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of indispensable data. therefore it can be meaningful to invest in a continuous power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these tools can automatically be able to save and run the system. if you purchase a USV, you should even be sure that they are the same quality standards such as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential hazards which your computer system is exposed and compare its safety in current disturbance with the costs to avoid this. a 500W USV can be used for less than & euros; this is just a small price difference if you think about your calculator. finally, you should always think all cables to trenne before you come to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering which allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">But they are in comparison to the hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you must send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com are available online storage services. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more at your disposal, in the case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be reviewed in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission error can be automatically adjusted in accordance with the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer, and therefore they are desasterful.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are due to transmission errors. the filesystem zfs and btrfs constitute at least the data integrity between the operating system and the disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you if it happened in your hardware. all of these problems remain undisturbed until you have no protection in your hardware. it's pretty annoying that it should not be thought of that. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably secure data way than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses, as they generate Intereferencing within the stream stream. in normal file systems this error remains unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not especially affected by transfers, you should look into the future. for 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and highly scalable as well. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it's soon available for & Linux, and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs system. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanism the zfs used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss at the notebook and 46% at work bench systems. when notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the most masters. it leads to a lower damage as such as theft or reinstallations. but it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know quite a few viruses and under & linux; it has been no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the widespread file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation into a sudden break during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file was not completely stored before the problem happened, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat for digital data: false, theft, and human error, are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and roughness characterise for all types of light sensors are far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so you will be no longer affected for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a plan and try this backup before using anything to do something like the reinstallation of your operating system, sharing records, or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you would have luck when the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A desaster proposes locally and destroys a lot. do not forget flight accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterpreventation is always a non-store storage. bring your backups to the stairs, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and is a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference protection: backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete momentary snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last difference backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time again. this fuse comes to a versioning system at the next with the exception that is only abdicated and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool which allows you to easily setup your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmitting scripts, rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens and if you would like to increase safety about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure online images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time, you get a full daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly monthly message for at least one month and a monthly message for each month. every further examination should be done manually after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the picture file stored IPTC files, associating XMP files, original, storage, scalability, media, reinvent pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the period where you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies you should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you must watch everything today. unfortunately, there is no other way to come back to the current system. all 5-8 years you should ask oneself like the current system backward. if less varieties you have used in the past, it is easier to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of declarations in this document. use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization, today is available for everyone. if you have an old system, so that reading your pictures you will store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you can change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or change your file format, if necessary to convert your library and if necessary to a newer standard. keep open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is to change its scalability for the possibility of changing a system in its size. this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have put scalability with the area and you want to enlarge it on a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and lay them to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check out the dmesg command if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb / dev / sdb / dev / sdc1 0 & b; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & b; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBed; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & mp4 / corc1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is able to read more, you can create these yourself. this task will become easier by year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard, but it can be much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can now have a lot of administration information but not as many as TIFF needs. this format is recommended to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread use as image format. TIFF can store images in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. a problem is however necessary to store your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a license-free and open raw file format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer is now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon as well.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology has introduced to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. this is an important characteristic technology that allows users to enter into a file itself. file information is stored with extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored the XML / RDF file.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archate it in front of your photo, mostly in the file format. XMP makes it possible to put the metadata separately from the file format and the picture file would come to. therefore you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and lay all there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata. to the activities of DCMI lies the work on a architecture and modeling, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standard and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the images are on the camera-frame, you can use them as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw materials. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile processing, you can use external programs. if you come back with & digiplug, you should add the metadata again. these were cut at any circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyrightly with a digital watermark. export it then in Webgaleries, you can use in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious; add a description on how you can add photos that you have already on your hard drive, but you can add many advanced settings to importing images to your nightendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; use this using the computer, turn off the camera on display mode and switch on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect to your camera. when the connection is made, an Fertig indicator will appear at the lower end and the preview photos of all photos on the camera will display. some cameras are displayed, the filenames and a symbol of file instruction are displayed for any file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to any entry. with the afford features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of a details and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photoinformation to be stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer. note that with some digital cameras not all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata illustrates the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer's classification, GPS etc. these information is the same as in the Metadata side bar from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. please note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then choose from all. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digious;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; as soon as you select the photos, select the button selected and then selection Selected. the button selected is as long as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera supports this, another option is available for download. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digious; however, in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance window. if you select this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download all buttons or choose from selected buttons, a dialog appears where you can choose the target album. the list of existing albums is sorted, displayed in the section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug, the photos of the camera will be loaded into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once, when you want to delete the button. if you want to delete a few, then you must select this first and then delete Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos taken from the camera, they will not be deleted. so you should be sure that the photos were successful in a & digious; -album can be downloaded completely, before you want to delete them from camera. if you want to delete a camera, this is much faster than that.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras do not use as filenames for the photos used as filenames. filenames will normally be revoked after the photos taken from the camera. this can be used to double filenames, if you have taken photos of different ascents to the same album. therefore, it can be sensible, the date and time when the image has been taken into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for date-based subverbs. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission will open three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding items are copied from the EXIF data to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use other date format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. turn the option date & time. for more adjustments you should read the command full time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera file names, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase, or in uppercase when you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, used & digious; for a photo it is used below the name, which provides the camera in preview. your settings can be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious; may use all information on the orientation of the camera to hold a automatic rotation during the approach. not all the cameras are ready. in the section of page Metadata you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is normally switched on, and when your camera does not deliver these information, you can turn off & digious; the photo in the original orientation. if you turn off the automatic rotation, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera was made information about the date, which the photo was made available, & digious came; this sublime is based on the picture data. all the cameras are based on the same album. all the cameras are available on the same album. not all cameras are available in the same subsection. not all the cameras are embedded in the picture page Meta Data. you can read them about your camera in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you need to set this option. use the button Advanced, and select the option for the bottom-based sublime at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is the button download. select file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also choose more than a file containing the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug; you, where the pictures are loaded high. select the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in length and latitude and can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses an aircraft to handle an area due to automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forget later, where exactly the photo was done, you can only open a browser that shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious post; users who want to localize the place of the photos, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to connect the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how does the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are some of them working together with GPS receivers. either as a map module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, but you need to save these data in the GPX format, because this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of pictures and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacity and copyright data. these data will be selected automatically to the relevant IPTC data fields, when using a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autorttitle is a synonym for Writers Line: this field should be included as photographer photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer, since this is a more detailed description of the car field, this also must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publishers is a synonym for providers: use this field to view the photo. this must not be the author, if this is to be registered for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency must be provided here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store data stored in the relevant IPTC rim. thus, the metadata can be permanently contained in the picture and are not only available in the database of & digious; these metadata also occur in & digious programs and can be imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image zores as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments using the images embedded in the pictures. this allows you to read the label also from other image poets. note: at pictures, which are already confessions, these are overwritten by the & digious pictures.</seg>

<seg id="294">By default, the image processing is used a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch it here. you can switch the tool bar, if you use the imaging in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and lower areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing this picture can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the immediate declaration.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setup PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. thus means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files you can compress the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF pictures. it does not affect the image quality as the deflate algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="299">With setting up-free JPEG 2000 files you can store any loss free. even if you have written the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digiplug, the image processing was only a viewer viewer for photos. currently, it was developed very quickly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard resolution is that all green pixels are equal to more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixel error in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option shows the image a bit softer but the 2x2 grate pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used like the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance uses.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard it is a solid color balance that was photographed on a white card which was shot in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that lower images will get in four steps more details in the top lights. this option will be ignored this option.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default, it is the top, so the parts of your images are used, due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights, as it shows the top lights in various rosemones. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from plants.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as fast as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the lack of green and red shares of not yet satisfied blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you reconstruct the option, you will get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to put him somewhat higher than standard 1. but this may also be done later into the picture options defined & digious; - imaging the time for Demosaicing small, you should be conservatively able.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data, which will have many cameras and also known as a matrix colored pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw introduce you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests, it was produced as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm of Dcraw. Bilinear is interesting, if you're looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is surely the best method for a paint correction, since you will be carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as these should be given. there are also LCMS and digious; information as the color information from a colour space in the others are to be translated as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Issues when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder Sing here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & digiplug; check out the folder while the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC Profile you have the option & quot; standard supply; for your profiles, everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management screen is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images rendered color does not manage the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model you need. not all profiles are created on the same way. there are some examples such as Canon, which does not contain any color mapping or Gammade-. currently corrects dcraw Gamma not for conversions at 16 bits depth. this means that you need to perform the ink mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft-promo-profile, with which you can emulate how your printer can print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors as well. this might be correct manually, rather than to flashing the algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is fairly obvious that colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, there is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supporting a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing is supported; many modules support, which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of the available modules. if you are using & digious; this module will appear as new entries in the menu window and beyond that you can see also in the context menu of the table.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can set a short shift in the menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) via KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugin.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the diashboard should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the images, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch the metadata a or, which ends at the bottom end of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features indicate a list of all the cameras supported on the left hand side. on the right-hand side a button automatic detection, which is connected to the computer. if you want to use this camera, you make sure that the camera is properly connected, and in the image mode. currently, the port settings are currently supported here, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can rely on the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire-saving storage camera from the camera. you have to indicate the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / hull, specify when you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digiplug in order to use your digital camera, you need to connect the camera to your computer to display and switch in display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digiplug; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and manually, after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the menu of the main window. if you own more than a camera, you can enter all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option dialog for shifting from &gt; images in the trashcan, you can set the talk of & digious; when deleting a photos in an album. in the sections of a photos and deletion of an album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down & digious; when you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback, otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also use the welcome to the welcome screen of & digious; it also accelerates the start-up of & digious in circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The attitude at the start of new photos are forced to search & digious, the base folder was deleted from & digious. this prolongs the starting time of & digious. if something came from the base folder, asks & digious; you know if it is to delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour schemes can be found in & digious; used to adjust the main window to your taste. this settings can select below the design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be recorded at the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digiplug, you will find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; it contains a fast image processing with some base tools. you can use it to preview your photos and for correction and improvement. the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry No.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digious; therefore, you are not part of your distribution. additional information about the KIPI modules can be setup in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status parts at the lower edge of the window, the filename, current data number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of imaging change your photos. however, no of the functions will change the original photo before you have used to save the toolbar file. note that you can't restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should be able to finish a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save as a file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can reproduce the original image by restoring the image processing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have carried out on the photo since the last deposit.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the imaging can be reversed or reproduced. the last action can be reversed automatically by using Being Restoration or Restore Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should get the shortcut, Ctrl; -z for reversing and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you receive the & LMB button on the back common or reproduce button in the toolbar a moment you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entry, all the actions are also reproduced between or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation use in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current photo you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can come in the photo, and zoom out in the ptrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the check menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. when you don't want to use the Esc button. if you don't want to display this tool bar. if you don't like this, you can call this from the & digious window dialog; you can open it from the & digious window. see the section for setting the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the menu file and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole phrases. all image detail shots can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and from the menu album Export Printer assistent. if you follow the assistant, you will need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a side panel on the right edge to provide important information and actions for the selected image. the same sidebar is available without the navigation bar, also available in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider leaves the sidebar and disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling screen, you can enter the label with unlimited size or insert it. note, the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are allowed to be copied to EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters are truncated and special characters are coated. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on it, use either the button application or change easily to the next image that will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also read the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you select a metadata setting that will always be written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows an assessment ema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or with the keyboard abbreviation Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select this out and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field emergency. the coding is as follows in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keying view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with the previously used in this & digious; meeting of the stitch.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adjusted dynamically to the given search phrase. you can quickly restrict the number of options in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief at the input of stitching in a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are saved for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed through markings of the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all the keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, If you want to have a choice with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The piping filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. typically, the left side bar will be used with their album, filum-, Keyword and search views. if in addition one or more keyword filter will be used on the right. all the keywords will be available. all the keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw tags, and place. if you have chosen several images to be provided with keyword. if the keyword exists, you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and place on the selection. then, a dialog appears if you want to place the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the above example, the main window depicts the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keywords that put the amount to three pictures. they were drawn with Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword from the right keyword has drawn away and placed there. a dialogue asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at each start of the program. it can also be switched on under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and realise that it would have to be or to have it, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is sought. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keywords, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string which is already set up in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can select a Advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouped options, do not need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why did Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why one distinguishes the colours known from your camera or scanner is an predictable deviation of the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a colour-managed workflow you can reach the colors on your camera or scanners, or the colors that you create or in the web, which correspond to them from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is on color administration, then everyone wants to press what buttons need to press for the results which he would like. unfortunately, this tutorial is to give you adequate information about color management systems. additionally, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informal decisions to meet the required results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows are met all of the criteria listed below, you must not take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You will work on a monitor that is calibrated on the RGB colour space (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other educational expenditures are by e-mail or web where the RGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works well and makes life for all that simple, why should you use another color space and do thoughts on colour assets?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenche region, and the colours in the RGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensionally representation of sRGB with some larger farms, check this page here and then click info and then on information about RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to break my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the RGB colour space or not, you have to work your monitor, since sRGB merges the circle. if you are working as a color space of RGB, then you must either use your monitor on the RGB standard, either a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. use it therefore before you try a further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, identical, automatic and contrast expand from the menu, automatic correction will automatically try out of your colours to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects, to see which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the leukable values about the entire picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shady. this function is often an ergonomic correction for pictures that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method adjusts the amplification of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity can be as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results achieved at the improvement of the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in an image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic weight: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it calculates the dark and bright limitones and adjusts the red, green and blue canals on the entire histogrammacy range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhances: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the one of the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible range and a re-loss of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white wine-off of & digious; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The White-equal correction is somewhat limited to an color space with 8 bits per color. if you can perform from the original image, you can perform areas with overexposure. if you can perform the White-like in the pipe mode, which in 16-bit mode, your possibilities will be better correct.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white anoint algorithm of the copyright by Pawel T. Jochma. they launch it on the menu entry colours white-equal to imaging.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adapted in size. on the left-hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the target image. if you want to see the original box, then it's enough to click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos includes a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram is displayed, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels is displayed very small guminescent values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your earnings depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows allows you to improve or down the shadow details of your photos or also down dimming.</seg>
<seg id="401">Note with the above mentioned checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview for calculating the color temperature of white balance. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white sample with the list of defaults. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed aggregate increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is overexposed. this will display the combined result in white balance. this will be displayed in a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set to save in a text file and later load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings sets all filter values back on its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. please note that neutral settings can be shown a different picture as your original. if you want to save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding is needed and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color key correction. this tool provides an integrated path available to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always take the same error. in the manual for the key correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to determine that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug, tool color effects presents four color effects, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, an neon effect and a canter filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabato, an effect of which was developed when one partially developed printing a short flash, and afterwards the development of the image has been reversed. the result was a partial negatively of image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase is created, that's not to create photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is (1) and the applied intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation so that it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimized color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. this is a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrast. the characteristics of the choice for natural photographs. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photo stories, especially those who are hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameters level controls the brightness of the results and the shift repetitions the strength of the Neonlichts. at large images, the filters can overload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color consignment and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors. once you are satisfied with the result please use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">In case you can make a photo of bad light conditions, you can also get a good choice for brightness / saturation. even in this case the tool is able to increase the saturation instead of saturation. all changes you can do in preview if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leuchstrength / contrast / Gamma, the tool is based on the correction of the exposure. even if the dialog has been complicated for this tool, you need only the range of shooting. specifically the three shooting beneath the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, an histogram, active channel or the selected area. under the graphs, three slipants can be clicked into the inside and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and change it on how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: using this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y-axis can be used. in pictures the large areas of a constant colour is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top of the dark sounds, the middle for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three paint pin paces can be set in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow, medium and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area. there are also two knobs which can be used to evaluate the output values, for example, to create an uneasy picture as a background, while something else can be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: using this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and store: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and later loaded. this Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color paces, the input values are automatically adjusted to all shades, medium and sun tones. click the preview of the original image to set the displayed values of the HistoProgramme for Rotor, Green, Blue and Luminanzcanals.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overbelichtedicator option controlled all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and correct picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side, half of the originals and the target screen will be displayed, depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel of the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this boxes there are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. most of the linear mode is the most meaningfully. for pictures with large areas of constant colour the linear mode is generated by a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps further.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cventar to the right, i.e. the brighter sounds, then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dark sayings and the corresponding image pixel can be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see. if you display this marking on the area you want to change a right line on the curve, set the original value. create a point on this line and move it up until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. every curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three colorings -buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want and click the original image to set control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overbelichtedicator option controlled all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white image that was corrected in Luminanzweg. shadow and sun tones were applied with the colour pipette and applied to the curves (1) and correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu-channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the duct selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note that you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window displays you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you place this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appear to give you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are below the right below: knob for red, green and construction allows you to keep these channels. if you also enable the option to convert monochrome, because the channel mixer is then convenient to generate the creation of great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible noise that occurs from farbrauschen. if that of the case you can improve your monochrome conversion to improve the colouring first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be stored for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overbelichtedicator option controlled all color channels to display overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photograph in which the blue channel is readjusted. the option of luminance is activated. the original image is under (1) and the illustrated picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is Black / White a step, since color images can be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford Magazine 5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good to fit all scenarios and fits very well to portraits of the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) Green filters.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangered filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linker filter. this enhances landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photographs. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lenticular filter. this creates dramatic celestry effects and can simulate scarlet for day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) RotFilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the shatteln. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digiplug. tool: applying this tool you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless if it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a screen, the bulls of an old master, a Pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or as a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the certificate of the depth and three-dimensional chain of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the relief relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug, tool frame can add a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a picture it is not easy task. a possibility to keep his attention to the image. this is a psychological barrier for scattering the eye. under the frame the module can be started using the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set you select the desired frame type for your image. immediately the image with a colored line, niepce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), painted it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a pop and decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with decorative target image will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of pictures, especially when you have used the tool at page ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text in a picture at any place. this also goes to several locations if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your mouse. if you need to adjust the character size of image size. the larger the picture, the bigger the character set must be. finally, select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK." after the picture has been stored once, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & standoffs digious; tool encil, you can create a stencil over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Picture Templates can be used in imaging, for templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions regarding size and orientation. you must, however, if you want to add the PNG file format. if you want to add your template's file size. if you like to add your templates & digi; templates, simply send an email to the & digious; mailing list digicome-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you have copied the templates for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the templates has been set to a design view that reflects the signature of the template folder. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the representation image. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button resized the underlying picture. if you want to remove the mouse in size. if you want to remove the template on the whole picture, you need to scure the image according to the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this knob to postpone this one under the template. then take the image and insert it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your picture. the picture will then be adapted in automatic size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but it produces, especially in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works at the contrast of the edges to see a picture. indeed, it works rather intelligence. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Reproduction is possibly the best of the three because he really improved the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. this means that sharp edges are slightly wounded when using color points. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras do usually need more often sharpness than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has been used in internal sharpening. images on rough-size must always be suspended during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you deactivate this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo of the sharpening. that can be correct with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, this should be careful of course, since the results are not very natural: sharpening the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, you can reach the tool tab for sharpening a picture. under editing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution that adjust the image to a bit softer. use the tool to adjust softness with the menu entry, and experimenting with the settings on the right side of the dialog button shows the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unblurred is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview can help to edit the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be able to amplify the effect. if you make the imsharper mask, you will create noise and the impression of grass in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a number of pixels on each side of a edge by the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore get more images at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount makes the percentage between the original and the wiped picture of the original is added, thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use of difference. it can thus be used for an edge of filter. in this way, areas are excluded for an edge of the filters and therefore, areas with a soft switch between the tones above and therefore beauty treatments are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp edges was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious tool was set and focused on a picture by improving the edge. it used to be protected by the copyright protected area-based filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get a picture to & quot; reforessienquot; this is better approach to sharpening images. this is using a technique called FIR nese filtering. it is possible to use a sharpness mask. reproduction can usually start better results than imblurred. you can start it out from the menu by pressing a button in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the Gauge's folding. the Gauge's folding has a very long tail, depending on the original size of Vienna, the FIR nese Inverse the Gauge 'is even very strongly influenced by remote pixels. caused by far unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value when your image is extremely blurred but should be careful to Heiligenscha.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a correlation of correlation can be used to reduce Artefakte. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation was reduced to the modulation effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Volume filter: an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce Artefakte. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. an useful value is 0,03. a high value is still left to pollution.</seg>
<seg id="502">Caution: this is the radius for the Gauge 'hedge. in most cases you should avoid this value to 0. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you have a value unequal to 0, you might also increase the correlation between and / or the spoiled filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. a increase of the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or Gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module will be very slowly when you choose to select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores as well as loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any reproduction parameters will set you set to be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform any trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately, but they left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, use & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unblurred produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by preventing a greater neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must still be blurred. even under optimal conditions it can never be seen the effect of infinity. for the Viennese filters you can always show the result of the FIR nese Filters always at least as well as the Unsharpness mask. the FIR nese filter is often better when machining small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to unsufficient light for the Auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the method of sharpening, in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The controller Glue has the sharpness of the dark, in order to generate a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinte enables the modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired artifacts with an unprecedented level.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are recorded at the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you like to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should be found so that no sharpening should be subsequently necessary. please note that the details can always be subject to the problem.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction-sensitive alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly into all directions, while a value is near to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grained or a high value of a similar pattern. JPEG Artefakte will be best solved at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via alim. p then define the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is equal to larger structures. the higher this value is required, the more is needed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns to how often the algorithm is going through. normally you will find 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle control here [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, then it should also generate small angles for a long term. you should therefore select this value as possible and for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrative stride length [0,1, 10]: integrative stride length in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never more than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More of quality that you get through selecting this option is only low. he doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. each setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors correct is comparatively very fast when working. however, it can still take very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button upheaval.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with little artifacts. the module is produced on a photo that caused by a analog black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie position during the trip, the original image is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious volume came; a very powerful tool to reduce image changes. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Peter Halls.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, such as dust and hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or moirems; -effects of injected images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about configuring digital cameras, you can read this tutorial into English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen picture above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the subwindows details and the lower window settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter size per pixel and can be spoiled by the radius, the image and the color in him will be smoothed and so that smaller bugs will be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening. this value sets the pixel distance between the filters to the front. if it is lifted to reject this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot receive greater and noise or dirt.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too hard, the whole noise can be removed or smoke can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either to change colour or luminance to improve an image. these settings can not be controlled to the smoothing process which will be controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings can not be controlled to the smoothing process which will be controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas, which typically are stronger. it doesn't polluted the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: the alignment of phasenjittering absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of the luminance. if it is lifted up, the edges appear to appear. if it is too high, noise and phasenjitter will appear on the edges. it can remove socks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">To save and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the room output that you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how to change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and correct with (2) and the volume reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes it is a picture to crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw a bit softer, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen drawing with the menu entry, and experimenting with the menu entry on the right side of the dialog button shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious cup; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo file management.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restorations gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts. it is well adapted to immerse Gauge's noise, film grains, kratom, compression acts and local errors that occurs in digital, original or subsequently digitised pictures. the smoothing occurs along the image contours and therefore obtains the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the text is developed with another tool, the error correction, performed. the algorithm to the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Franconia and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it is even very far away. as a lossled compression algorithm he creates a few compression & quot; artifact-quot; - small standards which are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast on the job. however, it can still take very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore terminate the calculation during any time.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how a photo with equal space is restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grains on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the correct figure below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures can be applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts created by the scanners and the photo paper. the original image is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug. tool Hotpixels allows you to remove Hotpixels of photos taken with a CCD camera, eight to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem especially in high quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel positions; and "quot; light pixel positions; on a photo with a dark-picture Subtraction method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button Dark Picture. this tool can be seen automatically the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">When you have an old digital camera, it is important to discover the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark photo to the correct image. a automatic processing of the dark images will find the bad pixels. be aware that the assistant shows the last dark picture and will reload this automatically at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image and preview can help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preconception.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durincision: it is determined on average of the neighborhoods where the resulting color is assigned to all defectives in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim), which are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square turns (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel within the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cube: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less is moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetmentation, i.e., underexposed corners, to correct a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not exceed the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor. telephoto lenses shown this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at aperture filters, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should, even with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unchangeable effects through movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and colour and grey scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter that is used without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction will be working with a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light-amplification at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density amounts to 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or by a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate a small degree of compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, contrast and Gamma-settings: the work of a picture with the Vignetting correction is reduced the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options. the regulators make you only positive values as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to remove a fine new adjustment of the target image, then release the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma-zero and use the gradation from the & digious; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct picture. a Leuchimpke- and contrast correction was also performed on the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious; Linear distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool is working with geometric distortion. colorless distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grain deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and may correct the concave or convex shape of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar effect, but flattened to the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grab corrects the distant corners to the second ridge. if you combine this two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tons of tons can be corrected and positive values of friction-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the gradient. this value acts further to the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners argument has the emblem of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads a correction first degree through. negative values can be enlarged while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the data logging with a preview the distortion error correction. the values you are stored for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or cisoidal correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes. in case you can trim this correction as all first. if you have a new picture and then a tonnage-shaped correction would be the effect immediately of falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot. following the connection, you can correct the lines with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a ciscent distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove them with the trimming tool in the menu transformable from the image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tons-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is so to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. please note that if you have a camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the gene-shaped correction on a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of mitigguru.org, which is attainable under this URL. filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra-film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can choose the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters adjust film grains and film sensitivity if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of the green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter canals for reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infra-red filming in a landscape photo made of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the illustrated picture under (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a way Aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug Filter Panel is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your images. this is known by classical high-speed filters like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to enhance the manufacturers big silver-grains of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The actor monitoring effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems into the past. the treated image will get rid of your daily life. if you like this special, gallery-like, road photographic, graceful view especially in your monochroms photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains, although larger values are needed, on ISO-2400 if you still need more grains, so you can apply the filter back several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film grading effect on a black / white image. the original image is (1) and the machined film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The oil painting creates oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a high-level algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious filter; filters oil paintings are a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers in effect to influence this effect. the upper chooses the pinselsize between one and five. thick brushes are better for large pictures. smoothing controls the smooth or, from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the paper is marked with (2). pinselsize for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoother 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal dust. the lines that are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you could imagine what scene you could have chosen to scoop out. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two control knob with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob elects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (gluten).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon label filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; Filter engraving the image in 3-D when it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure, where colour is not the most important content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving Filter stages. the original (1) and the working image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an artwork using distortion effect. it uses the copyright-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: splits the image in cells and can be seen as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time for calculating and generate a high CPU load. you can terminate this effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of imsharpness effects. it uses the copyright-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Ssharpness: understand the image along the globular lines that emanates from a center. this simulates the imsharpness of a zooming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale imsharpness: getting the picture by rotating the pixels by rotating the pixel. this simulates the imsharpening of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance: poored the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera se. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: caught the picture by horizontal movement of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train to photographing camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness: poored the image soft in the dark and strong in the brighter pots. this produces photos with a dreaming and shiny focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shook: poored the image by random placement of pixels and simulates the imsharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: finds the color basins in the picture and get caught these without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time for calculating and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore terminate this calculation during any time.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make control drops on your picture. in this way it gives you natural your paintings. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn-protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">The size of the tropics allows to change the size of the tropics. since the sample size does not automatically increase the size for small images. number changes the number and the density of drops. fish branches changes the visual effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can start with the & digious; imaging a range free from raindrops. do not use the tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you start the filter detdrops, the area will remain open from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photograph has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. you will find the tools in the menu transformations and mirrors spires.</seg>
<seg id="629">This is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to be smaller. the big question is, how can you zoom a picture, and how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of the resolution can be found here or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, make it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the size with the tool size. choose the transformable size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change a linear interpolation method to increase the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow-up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. split lines interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digious; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the Reiter New size and are recorded at the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep the aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is equal to larger structures. the higher this value is required, the more is necessary, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and charging are exactly used. each stallying for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast on what makes it, but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load. you can terminate the calculation during any time.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo shoot by taking a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse and move the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while using the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the field of the photos will be cut out. as a result, you will get a good overview as your photo after the cutting. you can move the size of the remote zone by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by moving it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cut section The button-button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or file Save In menu file to save the newly made photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview window, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in portrait format the greater value of the height and in the landscape is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool diagonally cutting aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimetres, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to set automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialogue you can use the Max. proportion button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool diagonally diagonally and keeps its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are reading the cut tool, these settings are stored as standard values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are recovered the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the interchange aid may help themselves, so that you can put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third floor, harmonic triangles are an option to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the golden middle is a division that looks to different natural growth smells, such as the spiral of a Nautilus conel or the blossom of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we find as nice.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the error rational number 1,618033988... and it was used already with the old Egyptians and Greeks, that are using your temples and pyramids. artist and architect made the golden pitch in all times when you build up your images, buildings and even photographs to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the standing part is 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center represents smoother support lines, if you have a painting. these help are recorded at the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third floor-hedgehogs, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral design and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold-corner. it should be something that the eye is moving into the centre of composition. this can be a line that it can be simply because without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the above discussed golden spiral. its vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, gold triangles have no equisclicked triangles. diagonal lines can be placed on these lines.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles in order to break your frame, create a effect of professional photograph dynamic symmetry. try to place your image on one of the intersections and other visual information into the triple. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally reflect and scaling can be reflected in harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color, you can set the color of aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. on this type you can adjust the color of the lines on your actual picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to adjust the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a painting in which the things are turned around a angle. you can use this with the & digiplug; reworking and adjust the tool free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider can be set in degrees. with the button settings you can reset the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will appear on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation can be positioned a horizontal and vertical line. after you move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to move the two lines. now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will unwanted three angular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to cut the function cut off from the imaging.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-aliasing select the picture a bit after the turn. but notice the obtaining warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All performers will be performed around a fixation of the so called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will be updated automatically. on the right-hand side of the dialog you will find some information which you can help you:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angles in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right: shows the current angle at degrees in the upper right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angles in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right: shows the current angle at degrees in the lower right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is reduced slightly. for individual adjustment is this effect small but two adjustments produce a double strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you restarted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes on the corners. a possibility to adjust this is the picture with transformations of cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Touch your picture by using the Horizontal angle and the vertical corners. you can adjust horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you are pressing the settings, the angle will be displayed to zero. a preview of the target will be displayed on the right from the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the refinement, the image will be slightly legible. for a single shot this effect is mostly neglected, but two shades is created twice as much heavier and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After pressing the image, the image has triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate these is the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, by the way how these libraries were compilated. in most distributions, you will be able to process a large number of image formats with & digious.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence of other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system. but they will always be JPEG and TIFF.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to install photo processing are included in & digious; their description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools like sharpening, softness, roughness, reproduction, imaging, blurgently, & etc;. use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture-quot; in this dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image. in the left of it five buttons allow the comparative mode of the preview window to change. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Coaster module is a tool to convert a number of pictures to a MPEG video in form of a dip.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected photos into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module allows you to add a basic image file. between the individual images, you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All photos will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the dial-format. with this module, it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can only use the medium to burn the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you must first choose the images that will be packed into MPEG dip. then you can create more extras MPEG Diaschau to create the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then included in image files in the portfolio. you can also change the images or modify the contents.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are choosing the file on a TV format, you have to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely will be the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the image is set to it. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast is very smooth.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. in doubt the name and the path of the generated file can be set at the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the final mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file on the name of the audio source file, this will run into the movie. after you can coaching your requirements. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee or in every rest a coffee, if you're back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packets to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photocrates. these combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. in order to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and import your videos stored in the raw format stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. you don't expect it from dcraw, that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes get better results with dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file first, and start the module. the Raw-Image window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimise the converting process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for white wine. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers may be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output files and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG is using a losable algorithm and produced for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, maintains the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your pictures or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as it only accepts a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adjusted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you want to select JPEG format, the metadata can be stored in the RAW file in JPEG file into the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to break this process, you can abort it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile-processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time. use this mode if you are sure, for example through testing at a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to transfer file automatically. this is helpful if you were created in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all the images in an album. it uses the program to convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all the images of a album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the transfer program from the ImageMagick package. you can get smaller or enlarge it. in addition, four types of image changes are available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 mm.): changes in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged; you can use this option to adapt to your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: unproportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed on this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">The printing process: preparing the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target screen, including background size, Randall size and background color, is accordingly adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send chosen images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the coming pictures before. additional images can be placed on the list of sentimed images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After that you have started the module, the images are displayed with the chosen images. over the button images you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last picture you will find a preview on the right side.</seg>

<seg id="882">The PNG format among the menu Images File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adjusted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and not to change the photo quality. otherwise, we recommend JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG pictures from file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original exit data will be added to the illustrated images.</seg>

<seg id="889">The option is random select that the images are displayed in random order. thus, the order of the pictures is used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Below delay between the images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect. you should also be able to show the presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects that you can choose. randomly chosen by each transition between the pictures another effect.</seg>

<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can search for all the pictures according to specific names, as you can see in the picture, on which Jesper, but not only Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user guide for & diting album;. if you don't like to read books, but rather like best functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & Home Album; and look at the quick, screen photos and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & then launch & ealed album; and in the first dialogue you start the demo, if you start & play on the menu for the first time, or select the menu entry in the menu entry. then some examples are loaded and you can test the functions of & kely album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you would like to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kely album; as a program associated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & kely album; see the time bar. a picture of this strip can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this lath will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time strip can display several different time units. each bar will show you a different unit. you can change between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database that displays only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline allows you to interactively use the following ways: you can select the displayed message preview view from the database (if you select a date, the time bar will always be displayed in preview photos) and the time bar will always be displayed the current date of the currently displayed photos when you preview in preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button and the mouse over the ruler of the time bar, thus the time values. if you select a range, you will be able to preview only pictures of this period. you can choose the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Home Album; presents two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is available in & abstract album; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user book, the software is described in & kely album; integrated version that you can create about the menu file HTML... call.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages must be created, you have to change some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and finish. in the following, each area will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a new album; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next you choose to see whether a & 2nd album; -Export file is set to see on the reviews page. you will find more detailed information about export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML page. this allows you to view that information displayed on the HTML page. note that all the pictures of a party are obvious. however, you can not use all the pictures of a party. you can not use this setting up to hide certain images in certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the adjustment possibilities are clear, which is why not specifically applied.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those must consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures more than for example, which have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewing of your site may change the resolution at any time. so you can search your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, and if it wants to get a larger image, he changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best you choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically supplemented by the next time. this folder you can select either a folder or from KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check this really all for the viewer. if you have created a URL for the base folder a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL you should be here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created from you have not to copy them in the final target folder you have to copy them manually. thus, the import function will need to specify the final target of the files, but the base folder in which all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described configuration options have been related to all three base folder and URLs. in this case, a sub-folder, whose name you will be set in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">In case you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users from & kely album; you may need to compile a HTML page for viewing the images. if you have already turned out a lot of time for viewing the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do with & kic album; this work must not even make this job again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & abstract album; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import another in your database. the image teams will be imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin files, internal and external. they differ to whether the images can be stored in the file, or whether the images can be stored in the file, you can choose all the images in the file and can spread this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kin file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see how to create a .kin file together with a HTML file, it will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file is looking for the images to two times. first, the images are not found in the file of .kin file. these are the images of the URL that you have searched when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for the exporting images are described, which you may exporting about the menu file exporting...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether you want to act internal or external .kim-files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">By option manually copy the .kin file, copy the images into the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy the .kin file to copy and copy the files to the .kin file; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kin files are normal Zip files. as most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not to compress the files. if you want to compress this, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size limit. if you do not send the pictures from full size because the .kin file is otherwise very large. here you can limit the size by clicking that each picture is maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to use a file using the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & refer page album; the exported database are described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you must choose which images want to import, afterwards, in which folders can be copied to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you'll be the category people to be imported to the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked if you want to imported into the third dialog window, which are to be imported into the third dialog box and to which categories are to be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the imported file containing the categories of your current database. an example will see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It simply needs to be simple, pictures to browse and view: if you see pictures you can see you often within different picture groups: watch & mdash; if you see images of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the various steps (1) fixed information about your images, through (2) search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. but it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual, more pictures are spoken, but often simply do these videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Ironing album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top file of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& W photo album; note the folder where your images are stored automatically. if you would like to read a different database in & kely album. if you like to start a different folder with pictures, you can start & dely album; with the -c button. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images / Images /</seg>
<seg id="951">About the menu entry settings / new album; setup... proceed to a window that allows you to change the settings of & kely album; you can change the different user possibilities in the following section.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call on the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available to the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described you as you can set up different features for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialogue that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box, you can establish complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a middle passwort as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the installation options, which are available to you for the list of members. you can select the category with the list of list. in the left window, there is a list of the current category and in the right lists of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& W photo album; distributing its modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwena. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. detailed information here you can find on the homepage from Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kic album; however they are sold separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">As the modules are used together from several applications together, it may be possible to test the modules with & kic album; because you should use new modules first with the demo database. this demo database allows you to open either via the command line with the command &gt; kic album demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu assistance. don't say, I would not have warned.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications which are using the modules via KIPI have very different, so it can be, that some modules with & abstract album; not work. this is the disadvantage, if you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & thin album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in Albums: this type of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions using & abstract album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kfast album; the current album, which is simply the actual view, so all the images that shows you the picture preview view.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album I have to hand over & kfast album; the modules also has a list of albums. here is & see page album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & D album; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then every entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the entry dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you want to use the category persons, & will be doing so, so if you have selected persons to view and continue to view this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & ten photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the dialog dialog, and select in the modules which are loaded loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start & dely album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you have used it from every other KDE application, you will see the window with the toolbar. at the moment, it contains not much more information about your pictures. in the section we will show you no more information about your pictures. in the section we will show you an overview of all the pictures. in the section, please click here for an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kely album; is the possibility to see each picture with comments. these include information about the people who were shown on the picture, etc. you can either place each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain remarks. if you are depicted on all images of Jesper and all images in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browses, as you can read in the section, if you want to see this remarks, when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In see you three lists with a text field by choosing persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kely album, as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the move of the images within the list: if you have shown for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be illustrated, so that the used names are shifted upward, the persons can find faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a list of illiterated list, click the icon for sorting to date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen annotations for each picture individually, you would like to edit any selected photos and note these pictures with comments. click this case simply to the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several images, for example, with the same person, then it may be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and menu additional entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">You are located in San Francisco, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an oversized. to show you that there is a overgroup, a special symbol will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the attentive dialogs there is also possible to add an entry to a existing or subcategory. in addition, you can also add an entry to a category of this entry. attention, this assumes that you are just your categories alphabetically. see for this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the dialog dialog by clicking the glue that form the edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have the appearance of the window so to your needs you can be satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... that offers you among others the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also send a frame completely out. if you want to display this window later, use the button options... and then windows an / out. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview photos of the currently selected pictures, or all the pictures you have not set a filter. for example, you can see the size of the mouse, by simply bend the mouse with the medium mouse button, follow. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you let a painting in the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as an background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">When you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the images that you want to delete and choose either the removing button or choose the menu selection. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>

<seg id="987">Pictures where the right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for the pictures 5-9, however, these images are present, so that I can display the preview of these pictures. however, you can't see this pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this feature, you need to copy files from the folders and to please copy files. if you don't want to avoid default of the relevant CD. if you wish to avoid annoying such files, please purchase a larger disk drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to make a little more privacy, you will need to see the pictures that you can see for other unaccessible. alternatively, you can see all the pictures that can see your little sister, ansted and the menu entry everything except at the current view.</seg>

<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the slides, select the position where you want to add the object, and click the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are more common positions, the following layout menu will be available, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under control or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed features, click on users to take these changes. if you have invalid values, a message is displayed with a error description. then, you can report the input error, and reject the changes with breaking.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you process a texture or a part of texture, you can view a preview in the own-view pane.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview of the self-view pane and a small example of the scene is displayed with the selected texture. as default, the total texture is scanned, even if you want to choose a sign in texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map) are crossed locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen photo shows the control points of the camera. you can move these control points with the mouse, thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, vanish the control points and it will display a small cross in the Wireless Internet view. this cross marked the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change shifting through pulling in the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual rating level. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the superordinate object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visible level of small or equal to the visible level of the visible level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as default. the object tree and the pane of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical display on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need another arrangement, you can set it as desired. you can also store multiple windows orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window on or below a screen view, draw the beginner to the top or lower edge of a view. a rectangle then indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, draw the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange multiple views over each other, you drag the beginnings in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views from clicking on the board card reiter to the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views, which are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the fixing window, drag the beginner to the desktop or click the little arrow pointing left at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view click on the small cross in the beginner bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can include additional views in the main window. in the menu View, you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with a view screen order... save a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the icon Rendering The icon rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A pender mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s INI files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to include a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can also include any number of Remote options, from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or select in the menu View modes... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name any name, but it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can use the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image section to rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality you can select the features that use & Povray; used as rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflexions. an exhaustive description of the Render features will be found in the User's manual for & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered using only one beam per pixel, various errors can often appear. these pictures are often shown in curves or stepped effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details will not be displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, images see with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn up anti-aliasing, calculates & connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is split again and adaptive because each pixel are depending on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray of pixels. if the difference between color values should be adjusted to the specified above pixels, then both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a specific extra number of pixels using super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid value of between 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between color values are divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be monitored individually and by further subdivision. maximum depth of records can be set with the depth of depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the beam process called jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changing & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated through POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, when the associated rays is no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens up a new window for displaying the & Povray; -counter output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray like scene, select the menu entry file importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently & kpovmodeler is currently supported, not yet the complete commander of & Povray; when importing error messages or warning, a dialog window will show a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to import source text in & kpovmodeler; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawning and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree to the Editor, to export the source code for & Povray; referring to the source text in the Editor. in order to import objects into the scene, select the source text in the Editor and drag it to the source tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert into & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can also include source code for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; it's a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the self-view pane, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. set the path to your documentation and the version a. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the steps of the points to the grid in the context menu of the Wireless Model Views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate a more precise wire model and thus a better nearing for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for several objects, such as the ball, you can set the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level views for extended projections, all wire-model views are further distributed if the camera uses a extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the projection and vertical projections, but requires more time for rendering projections, but requires more time to rendering projections.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross wall in the wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is depicted in a layer pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects are colored. the floor is depicted in a box pattern with two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross the seiling list, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering scenes is used. the values for depth and swelling value can be set. more information on the parameters can be found in the section called Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in section window orders, you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard window: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1077">You have just now & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start any more specific knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all the steps in this guide, you should take the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warning carefully before you complain about that you get a result of a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time you should notice these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set the camera, do not use the rules for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any error free, you can see the following commands at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window is:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of toolbar. please read the documentation to get a reasonable performance you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now often, so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The Wireless Internet view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate. in particular note the scene from the viewpoint of the camera (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new record with the designation camera. when it click on it, you can see the content of the object features, in which the different parameters of the camera will be found. in the user documentary about & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is later directions, but note that you can change the camera in view control points, with which you can change the target position of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button applicable or the input button, the wire-model views and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene. for example, you might set a header (insert-end body Quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a comprehensible method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite level as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the button applicable or the input button. the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The Wireless Internet view now also shows the level, even at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you see the object tree exactly, you will notice that you click the entry for the bottom flaps if you click on the icon + before the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotating and shift. select one of these options to change the possible settings in view of object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line, so that you can get to know some of these parameters. select shifting and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a somewhat single note at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog where you can choose to select how to insert the object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree (name = Ground-pigment), with one click on the button preview see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the only a matte black material, because you have to enter the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. enter the colors for the pigment. also there are many possibilities now, but you now take the easiest option.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on Quader and ball, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you render your image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colour which you have. here are further settings need. in the bottom list you have to enter two new attributes (you can also do this entry twice (you can also do this more often, but the chess board color list can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree any time and change the colors in the pane showing the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step as you have to understand the general work of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be done just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: at 1 (do not forget the input button or button application) so the ball touch over the ground, as you have shifted the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering results for now a strange result: like before, the ball surface looks like a matte black material. set a suitable material in the following steps.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you selected the sphere, you can now assign a material to you. as at the bottom, you can add a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">If you indicate your object, then change the name for example into sphere of pigment. click on the sphere of pigments, then select the color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to set up some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on user or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of the brightness and reflection are already shown at some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression that offers you & kpovmodeler; we hope you've learnt so much, that you can create simple, but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you razed a scene, the hypothetic hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which reflects the scenes) by each pixel in the scene, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how many atmospheric effects will work like a mist. thus the scene pixel are processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard file dialog you can select a file that you have before using & kpovmodeler;</seg>

<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog for setting up tool toolbars. you can add toolbar to & kpovmodeler; add commands to remove and remove tools.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a way to deceive surface finishes without changing any hives on the surface without changing the geometric form of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a Bump-map and to use a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body. these models will then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color pixel pitch, by using a picture file as color chart.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of the command dcop; which should be associated with each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the evaluation of external programs and commands. this is usually the function exec () used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively simple. here's an example in Python:</seg>

<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; setup assistants. thus, the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs are needed. therefore, system administrators have to enter the password for the system administrator (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b;. here you can setup general program settings. almost all functions of & K3b; should work on anieb. this dialog box is intended for personnel and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a tray transcription.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP; -functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functional scope, therefore rather your taste and type of task is crucial to which the bitrate programs will give you default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; function you need to make before make sure that & K3b is started. then enter something like the following console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; features that have all & kde; -program is common, supports & K3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The DCOP interface of & K3b; presents functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (K3b, K3bProject-0) An object can be achieved via the command line: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop K3b K3b Interface currentProject By using this reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3DataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">EcreateFolder (Qstring name) - createFolder (Qstring name). adduranium (KURL:: List URLs, Qstring Parent). eeItem (QString Falls, QString Quartz).</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>

<seg id="1495">& caudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compress & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoding (lossless packets have to be installed in the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read and saved in WAV files on your computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files are compressed into MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, advertisement (for MP3), oggvorbis (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Kodierer installed. all of these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions that are needed. if, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While setting up only once, the setup dialog can be called (the setup dialog can be found as often as a suitable configuration), after the daily use of a & CD; this leads you to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will be able to stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which Koid programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is listed manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main window. on the side step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen pictures with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different boxes (such as Encoder, to setup the encoder). you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coaxial and compression ratios and helps you choose the right Kocher.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information should perish, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there is also other such as' hormone 'or' Monkey 'that could possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages include the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats supported by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but more than this bitrate, the differences are less important because both costing are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">High-quality sound quality (for high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG tracks are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these tools only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer sufficient transparency for most people and most of the music tracks acceptable and has already high quality. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, joint Stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good comug for music of youngsters, portable devices and Autostereosystems. but not good enough for hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you really want to have the absolutely highest quality without feedback on the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or replaced by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available as a list of parameters. you can be delivered with & kaudiocreator; and the code to create folder and file names and the features of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs there are often a combination of programming settings for the encoders and these parameters. the manual or assistance to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the keyboards (English: day) to add MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & caudiocreator; parameters to be used (= button drawing at the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database to read / enter the information that all other information can be downloaded, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of itself: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (acquiring of the translation) 'm not Attorney. however, nobody can prevent the information without the & CD; but there is no information without the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company damage can be added. all information can be received by a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfake) address in this kind of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer that checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & caudiocreator; used by freedb, the geographic at the next horizontal mirror server is needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and compare the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror image files for the online call of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates from the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is the reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to store in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used; who would like to know it, looking for source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see also note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the luploaded WAV files, the code can be selected, so that the select file format can be selected. for the first opening there are pre-defined entries for an advertisement (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab card for setting the code. other encoders can be added on this tab card itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed in the respective Linux distribution before the encoders can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined code. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter of the Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a codiers, more information about its switches can be obtained via the input of a lame (lame) help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). however, 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read listens and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio code of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc für OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could note that what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; do not control the sheath of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips may give it as you have to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, but they are somehow insecure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all setup and our first & CD; read an lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps for average and ID3v1 keyboards (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packets for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be compiled for example using a search engine, as it is not fully free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source file, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd / cd exists, and that you own write permission (eg; by copying anything to copy).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & colaudiocreator; something that is thought to do only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what has to be repeated for any exporting & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders for compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with you to download the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change anything at any rate of a & CD; if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; - data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link on the real device name of your running system. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be used, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to select the output records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card map General Settings. here you can't do much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be noted, as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only In case of complete information please select, so that you will be informed if data are missing from keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card map CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; to be connected to the Internet, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selective field is simple, becomes a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting list name / filenames or tag records, you can easily change it. the directory or filename is changed with conquor - &gt; ename, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, apart from that example, if you want to enter everything manually, select the selection box and freedb is not used if you want to use the database before. however, these can be selected twice if this is worth reading in the offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data on request, for the retrieving & CD; information from the freedb server about the internet. how do you know what data is to get the CD? read the section on freedb. continue reading the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the site freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your area. on this road, the load will be distributed between the machines. this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work as the server regarding the server, as many Firewalls are booted in the protocol 8880, there is perhaps more thankfully compatible with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to translate any & CD; data to the freedb server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (please ensure that the folder / tmp is based on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one time when using just an existing drive? add parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, cross this on to throw the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you cross this checkbox, then / must be saved, the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored in the private folder, if you don't forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All in this way, as it is on the screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances, something must be ignored to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is adequate for very good stereo audio systems. the resulting bitrate is on average about 224-256 kpbs. this achieved a good balance between audio quality and storage usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Notice the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of production of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted as required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the entry file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of the reading of the & CD; the file is arranged on the hard drive. first, we will build an connection to the internet, because we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb must retrieve. the process of this section is described in this section must be repeated for any exporting & CD; it is repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are using a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, see the screen photos a little different from being used for a & CD; with successfully passed from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; collect, instead of retrieve it out of the Internet. comments are displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Not try the & CD; this example is to find. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done so now the & CD; the drive, which was defined in the main window, have to be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the tracks and their length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; it could be identified as audio CD; it could be read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successful by the freedb, all titles are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than a entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there, a window will be embedded in, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the check box for automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; Settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually dissolder the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the unit in the first row of the 'Aktuell Title', the rest of the data in the Command button 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist cannot be entered into the Command button 'refresh title, unless you have an compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidipell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words with uppercase begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this restricts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentcard. if you set ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on the tab card code settings, and take a look into the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all codiers or file formats. see Help for Kodierer in order to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select a record that is obvious to the style of the selected CD; this example is not important since we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway, please go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are below Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have already recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. select the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">The third button of the toolbar is. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of each piece. only the titles that are selected are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select the button All pieces choose to select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on button selection you can read out the reading process, this window appears to confirmation. click OK then we'll see a look at the window with the essays and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears if you are trying to work with a coid, which you have not yet installed. pieces which were not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered in this example. did you checked whether you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus check out and encode parallel. note the status of the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have configuration options to read this behaviour. the only one which seems to read and encode the results of parallel processes is the result unclear. the used calculator with an AMD64 seems to have a problem at simultaneous interpreting and encode (from however two different tracks).</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help with the program to needs your needs, if it runs once, the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different other programs, has many variations in settings. best read the step by step example to check the options and settings. it displays screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde;. besides others, he did not have real-time graphics and karaoke features, but some features, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, thus it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project drivers, which will be used for CIS cards as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the text on the screen with changing paint, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical display of activity of each MIDI channel through highlighting of the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so you can go to & kde; every MIDI file from a & konor; -window to move.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files (songinal or text events).</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you start & kde; during playing a song, kickoff the next time again with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog box with whose help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also select a file from a & konor; -window to the & kmid; -windows falling. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a music piece, open it and automatically open the button, select the entry button in the toolbar, select the entry once from the menu piece or enter the vacant paste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts, once you drag it on the & kmid; -window. (in several pieces they will be added to a collection and play after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; one piece plays, you can jump to any spot by using the middle button of the mouse and drive it with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or played too slow, you can change to the left and right of the speed display and to get the playable speed. to get back the original pace, double click the template.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: if one piece is played, a pressure on the button break or select a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry in the menu piece, interrupts the play button during no piece, starts & kmid; play playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two ways in one piece of music. some pieces apply texternis, others use Liedtorious event and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & cmid; you can set which events should be displayed, and even better: the event type will be automatically determined, so that you need to set up a song automatically. if you select the entry in the menu settings the entry will automatically be selected, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">In case you want to set an event type, select from the menu settings the entries text messages or songs. the same function also have buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarise. these will be the series after abruptly. in this section, how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find the menu collection under the item.... Click there on New and give the name to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the following suitable matches.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, they must be selected in collection manager. there, you can add to the button Adding a song. this appears again the file dialog where you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the adjustment of automatic loading to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding to the collection is added a piece when opening (using file open or drag & drop) automatically to the active collection automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then add to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song, and then click on.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the menu sequence sequence of the menu, the songs will be played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, choose the Next Song's Next Song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back, select the button previous piece, the entry to previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection-collection, click the button to delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection could not be deleted. however, that doesn't matter, because it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is strictly necessary for synthesizers which are not general-MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events put into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI-Map that converts all events of the change-to Bright Piano in events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus becoming a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards GM are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary modifications to play a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear often as desired. a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END define KEYMAP. "END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END, that the end of each section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an e-mail that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches must be illustrated by General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign of equality is ignored. it is believed that the GM's patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all-keysTo M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to play on the sound using the number M (GM Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a fighter. in addition to this, you carry the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (defenclosures), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is a patch which is meant with the concept of the patch which is a different perperceptive instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one that means sound at the sound height of the same same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to view how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as its presence. you have to create 128 items.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names only in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to form tones on the perspec channel. take a look at the provided keyhole.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form a number of channels to others. if you want to replace the first and second channel, simply make it simply in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others require channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap must be ignored in the file for this channel! if you ignore the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option may be useful for example to use the percussions patch on the performance channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchbenz ratio should be multiplied, in which relationship pitch-bender events will be multiplied by the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then used only. the value 4096 is used to be used in the map file no decimal.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM is preparing to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards will be able to play two sounds up to one octave higher. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the dialog for MIDI settings. you will find the menu settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of pike boards (one for each MIDI channel). on these four, you will see what sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed an instrument. if you have an instrument, the button is not more green but red, to view that no longer uses the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. the view click the menu settings below the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed when a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">An MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a piece of music must be played, it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so, the same MIDI file can lead on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can nipple, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file requires about 50 KB, while a MP3 file requires a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed, and etc; you have control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install an source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add & konqueror;, choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Disable the settings of automatic Adding to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow key to the left from Tempo- LCD to slow down the reproduction. to the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop I must play, if I want to play a karaoke file (or if I want to play a karaoke file) or to play a file, merely go to the & Conqueror; -Windows change and the desired file to the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without being able to add them equal to a collection, turn the setting automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us take you to play MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. so you only want to play the first file. so you'll adjust the setting automatic Adding to the collection and then open your temporary collection then this is a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid simultaneously and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent to me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, I animate me on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I studied mathematics at the University of Maite; Laga. at the moment I'm not a lot of leisure time for my hobbies, but I try to take me a bit time. as hobbies I have program, MIDI files, make music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you simply want to make me simply happy, write me an email: lark @ kde.org or antlarr @ arraisis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a giant joyful anticipation if you send me a postcard from your place or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to record a postcard or a MIDI file, you should contact me with me when I've got the file perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely rewritten in my free time and I would like to be kicked out of anyone. I only want to go on account because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - fixed the error, that the pitch with AWE-cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for the testing of the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Lusa, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter Cordes and everyone who sent me a patch, a troubleshoe or even only an supporting email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks applies to all these excellent musicians in the grid, giving us this wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; also on his homepage you can follow the development of http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development of information on pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">One sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer as the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound card. it is not the same as you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no sound card you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs when you could have a sound card, except that you can not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailinglists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple user interface for Mplayer, Phono and FFMpeg. the program is needed for playing video files from MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD, or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The window window is formed of so-called andeditable windows. there is always the window with the central view. in addition, there is a window with the playlist, and finally there is a window window that will appear only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to connect the preferred connections under the menu item, but these are individual entries. if you want to play a list of entries, which should be played after each other, then you should use the "thumb playlist."</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchical database. if you copy a entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the displayed entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and endurance playlist can also be changed by direct rendition of XML configuration files. of course you can only do the files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / you can simply choose one category of a category click here to view it as the next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML contents will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the same menu must be selected from the menu, or select either the processing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the workpiece mode or another group is selected without leaving the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during the start and end can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change of [General Options] No Intro = 0 obier option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will notice the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / kmplayer / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the start doesn't need to be short, it will automatically terminate through opening a different source. this would be disruptive at the end-animation, the user can stop the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">An easy example of an startup animation can be seen in the display of a favorite photos: tlt; & lt; IMG dur = "Meet" / gt; / bodygt; / bodygt; / bodygt; In the source package of & kmplayer; they are in the directory testing / several examples of SMIL the von & kmplayer; are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configuration of Mplayer in the configuration dialog for & kmplayer;. here you can set the path from the Mplayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">A different tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of colmplayer. here is the issue of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback tool in the configuration dialog for & kmplayer;. everything must be configured through manual loading of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module-Mozilla Firefox:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be re-bed the special box-bed for YouTube in the playlist to XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog file of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is available in a console application and to search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. when no error occur, is the backend issue within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Therefore always a predefined pastime for a particular Mime Type (of course only if this has been determined), this must also be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon can play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards either by using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV channels can be configured, the scanner can be used directly from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (video data recorder) Settings in the kmplayer is the dialog box in Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be selected ports to be selected. the default encoding must be selected (e.g., it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB to it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support can only use XVideo, it should work as Xvideo (probably this kind of game of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video uplinux expansion for the X server must be functioning properly in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, the KMplayers are used for different names. at the time of this documentation, these documents are dvdnavresource, vvdsource, source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are enabled, they start playing with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there references as I can drive my CDROM drive when I play from him (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is as user root after installing the device. absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom the CDROM drive is sure.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly on, why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile; it will not be closed with great problems. however, it was not closed down by the modest appearance of output file. however, it will save you by the highlighting time and time.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic adjustment of environments, in case of a new command (e.g.\\ Begin {command}) of & kile; automatically detach a space line (e.g.\\ by command {command}. this function can be destructible in the menu settings; setup... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally subdivided into some elements. & Latex; encourage the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the hough and submerest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">At the view of the document in the structural view the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective request.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating the own & latex; files can be found very helpful. once a DVI; file [lower right file is created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the medium mouse button in DVI; -viewer to the appropriate line at the & Latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI / file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font, and is besides PDF the exception mode of & tex; or & Latex;. there are many tools available to view, conversion and print from DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using RÃ ¼ rtssearch, the elements of the DVI; file is clicked on a element in DVI; -file is clicked on the exact opposite section in & Latex; -source text is clicked on the corresponding section in the & Latex; -source text is drawn at the corresponding point in DVI; -viewing angles.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is being used with several files. using a Master document, the work is simplified using other integrated .tex files. when using a project, a project can be set on project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & Latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (unless no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file on pnderungenâ s will be done. there is no call from & eyepiece; after fast installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">At consideration of the reworking tool bar, the three large selection lists should be found in all. the selection box for the rapid integration of shared elements in parts, chapter, sections,... The understanding & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is to be available for articles such as Tags, FuÃ ¼ notes or Notes, which are the deadlines for you:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a designation for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In reference: is used for reference to a specified name (selection according to a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation is displayed a selection list with literary entries. for the processing of & bibtex; the author are necessary to work. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbitex; and & cbitex;. the & bibtex; - Files primarily are written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶. is used for determining the font names. it is possible to define the font names, the joints, etc., there are the following fonts for disposal:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; there are two selection places available: 1. the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and the legend of the settings. 2. the document may be written by the bottom by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The font clasps according to the command\\ enturine class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the Scriptures. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this may be done also in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code document is entered and latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way for this is the use of the menu building or of the button extension.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compile. & kile; for storing the storage automatically expires automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document command, the protocol should be sought after the errors. when using quickens should be started & ocularly. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (English) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document. if, for example, a report with the font is to be written. for example, the command\\ Begin {den},\\ Huge and\\ by {on environment} may be closed, then the introduction of the font house within the surrounding area â. (Huge Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">These changes are only possible within the environment (from\\ Begin {den} to\\ by {den}). there is no show (number) for the number of changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many opportunity to attach the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, canned pressure, submissions, etc. are added to the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {#}: this command is available for the cursive pressure and is long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a\\ end {on} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be expressed with\\ 'ph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: created a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ Begin {odds} and ends with\\ by {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After background writing of the source text with the & latex; label language is shown, now a step-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as the assistant was entered a bit text, some adaptations for the better readability of the document should be completed. these should be a quote, a few positions in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document has been viewed, the Editor's View or Ctrl E can be turned back to the editor (at the internal viewer), whose window is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">As soon as the DVI / file is created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a partial file format (English D e V ice I n). these files are created by & tex; or & Latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF format or computer screen TVs.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI, file are the same steps as you can view the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then be printed by a file (in the viewer) (if the printer is properly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar uses the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & Latex; -source code is created, the conversion may begin in more common formats by means of buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search guide the direct jump from the editor to the current position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & Latex files. just Modern under Settings Kile may be setup... tools can be made of construction.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to be placed forward, the mouse pointer will be positioned in a row of the source text and then connect to the mouse button. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; -viewer takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & kile; you need to be specified as text editor; in & eyepiece; as text editor can be set (Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">In case using quick installation of the & DVI; -viewing does not include an error. should an error occur, it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file contains the error source in the source code. in the editor, the log file will always be used between the errors. in order to view the incorrect line, the error file is clicked on the error in the log, and jumps to defective on the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once upon the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window appears to be selected for the selected template for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting the empty document, a document may be used either from the ground or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document. more information on this section are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Using latex users by & Latex; use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates that are created in & kile; created, stored and loaded, to facilitate creating a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either a existing & tex; - / latex; file may be created or create a new file. you can create a new template via a complete document and selection of file template documents.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a document by means of a new document, some character strings are replaced by other data (such as name or character encoding). these variables can be setup in settings... Settings will be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Therefore, when creating the own template, it is necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS of $$: this character string will be replaced by the input in documentation class. typically it will be in such cases:\\ Penetclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {complete article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant, and thus creating the commands throughout the editor. once the document has been created, the following steps has been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, then the own presentation can be balanced instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one in the Internet and can be found under the above steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including also & Latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for you are made directly from & kile; you can get out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To find out more about & Kate; and his opportunity to learn the manual may be dressed in Kate. users by & kile; you can also start reading the chapter by reading the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; -command line, which can be called upon the program of the LaTeX reference. you contains an exception description of almost all commands that are in & latex; use you can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with flying trl button to fill the & tex; that means that in this way marked by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with the left mouse button mouse, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Using the arrow keys with penetrating Shift to taste parts of the source text in the Editorwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the opportunity to browse the various types of source codes and these results. for example, the & Latex; commands from normal text and mathematical formulas are distinguished by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants are added to this dive. this is an own way of bookmarks within the text. the menu item is highlighted or the respective key to the nursor or last dive-mark. in this case, this diving stamp is highlighted, so that they are automatically emptied in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent choice for the writing of a & latex; source code added, special commands for their selection. among them, the following commands are included in the text code:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete section (group of lines that contain on both sides an empty line). these expanded importance is not covered with through (like in other text boxes). these expanded importance is close to & latex; the only remarkable thing in & kile; is therefore that the distance is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command is also translated & latex; -commands with a hot star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To allow a part of a document, you can get to this first. & Kate. offers the key shortcut of Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offering his own commands for a faster fee. below, the following commands are included in the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">A complete set of paragraph. the definition for a subsection in & kile; is contained in the description of filling stations.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been clear that environments offers a central role in & latex; play. that's why & kile; for more commands below do environment for a single or full work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">At the beginning of the current setting (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor occurs before or within the command\\ Begin {environment} will be sprayed at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many shameful environment commands can go quickly to the sea view. this command close the most difficult environment, so that the surrounding environment will not be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Being TeX group a few important commands that are to them from doing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clammer.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the softwist clammer.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is behind or behind the wiped clammer of a & tex; -group #, will be injected at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many tightened groups clamps can go quickly to the sea view. this command close the most widely held group, so that the hidden structure of the & tex; -groups will not be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple beginnings as a GÃ ¼ nosgene body are used. for the purpose of this purpose, the sign is used in & kile; the sign 'for two simple beginnings is used. & kile; knows this case and for two close attention, for latex and latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic adjustment of the double beginnings may be setup under settings.. LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>

<seg id="1835">Within a table -environment, hitting & kile; the current line with\\\\\ with a connecting line breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; it is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added to the settings.. LaTeX will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users can arrange the columns in tables -ambient and all the Et-characters (amp;) to one another. if this tab is not possible to allow the tabs in the previous tab. although this tabulator is not fully sufficient, add & kile; some spaces for the columns of the current tobacco box.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate. already provides a good source code completion, it has been extended in & kile; in order to build special commands (mostly for example & latex;), three according to demand and the other two are for automatic locking devices. all these modes will be setup for different ways of working with different settings..</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment through the command\\ Begin {environment}, & kile; automatically add the command\\ by {environment} on an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the RÃ ¼ ckoo, the last character from the entry is removed and completely deprived. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering a further letters.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of its parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are displayed by selecting a command, so that a simply jump to these positions by means of diving stamps is possible and the desired parameters will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">There are some types of attitudes to these lists. you can refer to the lists for this lists. it is possible to refer various Wembellists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wrapping of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not limited to environments. it can always be entered with a few letters with\\ Begin and the call of the completion mode will be used as often. on the other hand, the environments will be used as often, that & kile; a special mode for the use of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">During the call of the incomplete setting of the menu or the keyboards of Alt + Shift to the surrounding area, the order to open the surrounding area will automatically be opened and it appears\\ Begin {. thereafter, the environment may be continued on simplest way and by pressing the input).</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart we will start with the menu plugins. thus the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all the plugins of the plugins and adding new standards. we describe each & GUI; -element within it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search engine. add to the plugins without a storage location & quantitative information; this path to the search of the plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarchical relation to each other. & quantitative editions; supported by Team Members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The names and email addresses are self-explanatory. Nickname is the user name of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member may have several roles in the project, such as teamleader as well as subproject conductors.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look out from the list of teammates, who it is. this happens by pressing the team member from the list and pressing Setze. the currently selected member (their identification) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1955">Automatic detection of accent signs: controls the automated transformation of aczapping characters into the corresponding encoding during installation.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime types: facetypetypes to identify different types of files. by using the Standard, the standard results can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default encoding: the encoding of newly created or in other ways to open open files (where the coding of the file can be addressed), but this setting will be emitted from the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not detected. this setting will be emitted from the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative error; created regularly backup copies, such as a blackout or crash when next start of the program can be re-produced. this is not the same as saving the file. also for even stored documents a backup is regularly created, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors or own view (or the documentation can be presented in a map), which makes it possible to preview the preview and the source at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful if the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and andocken / depending on views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages range serves to the tax of the possibility to disembark the indication of warnings through anuts of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place around the behaviour of & VPL; to change. it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronizing behavior of the VPL- and the source pane in shared mode. see the different modes available.</seg>
<seg id="1964">The parser and the structural tree, which represents the figure of the parser-nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action, it is possible to change the structural changes with the mouse button to make the macking action.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structural tree settings, the visibility of node in tree to work automatically and how deep in an amendment of the structure can be opened. empty knots are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups such as these are not found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for the fixing of abbreviations (a kind of templates), which are unfolded to extensive text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each may be divided for several & DTEP; s, it can be valid for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviations something else means in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed here. plugins are equipped with KPart applications from third side, which can be used by each KPart-enabled application, most well-known & conivoor;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not in a standard place like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is delivered to the plugin for the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the repository.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-lese" mode: check if the plug-in is refusing. only for reading-KParts refuse to load when this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this enabled, then testet & quantitative, whether the entered information is correct. select the save entry if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitative error; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redesigned. as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead of this, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented to support various implementations using plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin available, the support for the use of & gubed; inphaplus; add.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of debug for a project starts with the choice of a suitable Debugger plugin to the project settings. using the button options next to the Debugger plug-in selection box can be changed the specific settings.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger activates a debugger, some additional elements appear in the & quantitative / User Interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the variables are displayed by supervising variables. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding point are listed, with line numbers and conditions listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view where the output (as in HTML) the debtor is shown. it normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of debuggers all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to Debugger, if necessary, or it divides the plugin to allow debug requirements. this action is triggered by default, when a project is opened, that must not be counted on a debugger that it must not be counted on normal conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart at debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to Debugger or end the lug to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to the server to allow debug requirements. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the edition of this requirement is shown in the Debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The debugger that starts to start with the implementation of the script and to send information about the supervising variables as well as the currently executed lines is continued. if this is done, the implementation will be resumed before a debugger that it starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Shows the Debugger that start the execution of the script, without information to supervising variables and the current line number. if this is done while a script was given, the execution begins, as soon as a requirement is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The monitor leads to the next statement in the script, without the functions or include files.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The monitor leads the next instruction in the script, whereby if possible is in functions and include error adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Shows the debugger that overgo and walk to the next, as there would not be the current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the primary value will appear in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of variable.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script file and / CSS; s / DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and file attachments. day-folders includes two file types, symbolised and descriptionaries of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster into a document when a user may ever use.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), download or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details on the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create XML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featudialoges, the & quantitative; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. toolbars enable quick insertion of tags in a document without any risk of a writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing as a folder. you contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the writable language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML, and declare if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use so many as possible, so other users get a better viewing and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits will be displayed in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">That is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only contain only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it can't contain anything but nothing about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when used is used, attr &gt; a argument of the function. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. gives the name of the class, where this method is heard. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the tlt. text &gt; -Day is intended. this is an only element of element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute a tags that this element can only be used for each attribute. additionally, it sets the name and the type of attribute. additionally, there is further tags that should be shown how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Are you used for filling used source codes for the attributes shown in Day Editordialog, and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. dcop interface within & quantitative trade; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and name of an interface. the dcop-methodology name within & quantitative; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a methodology. the arguments that are passed to the method. can be empty or% tagnty%, this means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list. it can occur only once. it is an only element of element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute textured a tags within a dialog box. this day can only be used for each attribute in a dialogue (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each group; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Gives a list of elements that may occur within the tags that are within the definite tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be chewed and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Space character does not influence, but pay attention to & and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & clt; whomthis &gt;, and & lt; article &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools can start up in the & quantitative; -window to start and check the TagXML. a further dialog appears to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available. currently, verification only occurs when loading the TagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes that & lt; schema &gt; -element from the & W3C; & XML; scheme. the filename for this TagXML file should be schematic.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, one & PHP, loading function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed by DTD's DTD settings; for a list of selected & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a newly created & DTEP; should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] Version = Use 1 for & quantitative; version & LT; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD (/ / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">To set up a action with Settings promotions... will be created. click New Action for the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned shortcut, with clicking on the user can be assigned a keyring; with Keiner is the current keyboard shelf.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detail panel and inserted by the action in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it's not limited) that will change the document or as input (or parts of the document), even the quick start -dialog, or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the script must be given the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripts that are variable in the command line: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative information: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current documentation. in case of a local document file, file is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative issues; only one instance is running, the text was used to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control and using the quantitative text.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current documentation or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script input of & quantitative parameters can be expressed as default. in the selection dialog, input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default settings. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the issued application may also be redirected. there are two kinds of output: normal issue, based on the default issue. the error message is to be specified, which is to be specified by the default output specified by the default issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the case there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add actions and configure your actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the New Action Knoppress at the lower end of the window starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the Tag attributes and you are planning your use, enable a dialog to edit "Tag" when available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graph more programs (or where otherwise it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 Pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Being Size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to realize what the action does, but also all other users of & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">Regarding the fact that the day began, I decided to create an opening button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually going to be interpreted, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user can be displayed in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol no need to be connected with the action. this is done by the menu with Settings promotions... (in & quantitative leus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is found, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags if there is still what else, or confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add a few common & quantitative; -functions to toolbar or add it to a better overview by some separator into several groups. make sure that the tool bar is selected for the tool bar. make sure that the tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (above left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to add the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the arrow to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to preview a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator does not support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & Conqueror; -button is the opposite of the Start Button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure your file folder. after NeueXML does not exist, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most significant enlargement of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the script language or the form language which you like. therefore describes this chapter as I create a & PHP; -documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could test your own documentation, see if anyone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you have to build an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language. then you need to create the docrc file. then we have to leave the docrc file, the first part we handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc = Path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentations, e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation 2 = A1.html tag1 = html 2 = tag1.html tag3 = tag3.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you see now in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc Your = php42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2, PHP 4.2, = Table of Contents = Setx.html Getting Started = introduction,... introduction = Fintion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = nage.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Please note the # ahead of Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there are no known limit for the playsite (except by understanding) mdash; but give it a try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents can be referenced directly to a file (and consequent at the top end of building mantra & mdash; folders is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to and & t; sign. these should be replaced by amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; -based & quantitative trade.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the scope of the docrc file that is intended to display the documentation of the context-sensitive help. by selecting the function called and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help would display documentation directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and file attachments.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of lineup separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can store your file docrc easily and can be stored in accordance with $HOME / .kde / Sata / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / etc.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example, documentation is used to use the & quantitative information; -Repository for the use by the & quantitative; -community. they will not be rich, but proud of being involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative leus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the copy of resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise to whom. at different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main-Archive, where all the other & quantitative articles are checked, and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the release. to sign the resources, what it is ensured by a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is ensured, both for our Team as well as for the future user.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can specify one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields must be empty (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can also instantly upload the menu DTD DTD (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installing, we examined & quantitative information; the integrity of the resource by examination of integrity and Signification. in case of problems, it can be returned correctly. if the integrity and the resource is correct, a message appears with the specifying the owner of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not yet supported by & quantitative; but the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in everyday XML format. there are the easier way to convert DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD loading and Convert in DTD. select the .dtd file containing the DTD-description, which should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">The aim name: created by the newly created & DTEP; it is written in the $KDEHOME / Sata / dtep folder with this name.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE chair line: the string that appears in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / or www.v3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP according to conversion: when activated, enhances & quantitative; according to conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative editions; there are some key concepts. in order to understand and make full use of & quantitative concepts. this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantitative; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally, and projects. this differentiation affects a number of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantitative information; utilised, available. of toolbars via promotions, everything is indicated in the common folder of & quantitative issues; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then stand to each in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items constitute a personal collection of web-products for a single user. this are custom patterns and toolbars. local items are stored in the user directory, so that they can use only this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project zogenic elements are available only within a certain project. this can be done by & CSS; patterns can be created especially for the files of a specific project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder of the project, which are common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editorwindows, the building point, the boxes of boxes, with information and toolbars. please smite in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the Cartridge with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current documentation, such as close the current, other or all cartons, reload, delete or upload CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click to the editor sector lead to an additional context menu regarding the provided document of documentation, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / insert), editing the mouse under mouse pointer or opening the file if the string signs under the mouse pointer a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor, the toolbars of the Editors are currently labored and with HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tools are shown. in the course of further expansion of & leaplus, toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they include one single day, e. g. & lt. if you insert it into its document, then click the icon that the day represents that several attributes (such as anchor), insert it, you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The insights (QIT) allow to navigate to the information about & quantitative information; to navigate, to open and walk through. in the representation with boxes of boxes are available for files, project, patterns, documentaries, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative information; this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project using right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading, or delete the files from memory medium can be performed using the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantitative is the use of templates. almost everything may be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire site & etc; there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which in which context them will be used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more about templates can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script. the concept of the outsourcing in Global, Local and Project is also working here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. via the right button of mouse, further functions are available, to edit or send with an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active documentation. by clicking on a element of the element set the cursor is opened on the position of the element. by law-click, a list of commands regarding navigation and recycling of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree will appear among other civil intentions. with it, you can change the attributes and name spaces. this enables the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation to find Web technology for your development. it can be downloaded prepacked documentation for & quantitative information; you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitative information; two boxes of boxes at the lower end of the window, can be reached via the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartridge driver shows information about any in Quanta current script. for example, the DTD uses the current documentation and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all the errors in the markup of the current documentation. & quantitative scripts that are executed, specify all error messages (as it is available) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative animals; toolbars are extensively developed and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the respective command. the chocolates of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantitative is the ability to send a toolbar with an email. & quantitative Tsar-Archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure them in & quantitative; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of the & quantitative; -files on your system. in order to get a complete list of options that can be delivered to the configure, enter. / ----help. the options are easy to understand and not performed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting from & quantitative; you should check if your path comes to the & kde; 3 bin folders. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folders. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& Beaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative development tool has been optimized for rapid web development and combined a well-engineered development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantitative patients began to deal with a obvious markup language editor? well, this would be an independent, advanced markup languages? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Not limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative is limited; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web-development tool. assemble: if one can define it in & XML; then it should be & emaplus; therefore it should be the suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be recorded, that & quantitative community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based on the outstanding application of Why? thanks to the & kde; - rumours is not only that possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative; as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Beaplus; allows web-to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this enables you to dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-coated action, scripts and tools are possible to enlarge it. (more info may be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantitative; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast Webdevelopment and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quantitative; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2124">Shows the symbolic links from the main window. this column allows you to set the bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When it is bookmarks in the current file, it will appear in the menu together with entries before or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents will be grouped from the menu, according to the filenames of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantitative editions; -Projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project folder of new files that could be there. that allows, e.g. graphics files in your project folder or a folder to copy, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, like & quantitative editions; the project manages. in chapter & quantitative information, please see details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project tool bar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only within this menu if you have assigned them this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. only created the names. actions need to be added to the settings. promotions are stored on tool workings or you will be asked to save if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete items from the toolbars or add what can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help with the field of mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& Beaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free, but like with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantitative representation; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled to the top of the project, such as the complete directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name the file is automatically completed.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative; -project file. by default, it has the names of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the expansion webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine that you want to access, except for local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you are empty this field, the default settings of the selected log is used. depending on the remote machine the remote machine could be needed.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>

<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection according to Gutthinks.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by plugged or, by removing the cognac, clamps from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings, which simplify your work. this settings can also instantly upload the menu properties in the menu tree in the bottom window or with the push button Shift; F7.</seg>

<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited and deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the lower window configuration, one can change event promotions, and add these promotions, change or delete. event actions are executed when a previously defined event happens, such as the sickle one file. see also the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantitative and quantitative; the last project, which was opened. this behavior can not be influenced by now.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project Open... from the menu project or the symbol Project Open from the toolbar. the Project Open will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If the quantitative file is closed, the repository will automatically be stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, changed files. the same happens if you charge a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project implementation gives free access to the files in the project. here, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The file restates itself also, however, the entries are opened and open with the right mouse button menu with the right mouse button menu selection menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the high-tech files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing of the current profile. if only a profile is available, the button will be blended to remove the removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the kernel memory and forgot. this possibility is useful if common uploading files is necessary and the rather unsafe password will be stored on the disk -Option not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative trade; many high load profiles can be created and so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing, or create a profile will see this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this must not be changed, except the network administrator does not operate the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Angkshaft, this is either a timeless function or a danger. do not use it according to your discretion. the password will be saved on the plate, so it can't be read well, but everyone with programming language can see it easy to see clearly in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. through easy exchange of view, many files and tools can be loaded and replace the currently opener files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative compounds; with which one has to do most. this helps maintain productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative information; to own workings.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantitative; preferably over the menu toolbars can be traceable. usage and add-in can be differentiated down in the section add of tool toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and the symbols are possible to be set out either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with new toolbar, toolbar buttons or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to one action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action illustrated that are self explanatory to use.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can be set in the menu with settings toolbars... and set the settings...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in the essential document scallop, code cutlets and files for shortcuts. & quantitative file formats with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, shift or any of the system existing directory in the template tree; it can be applied in & quantitative; in roughly the limitations which are intended for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some were using & quantitative information; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set before use in the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentation type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. it makes a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in the same manner to be efficient. some examples may be found in the storehouse under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not added a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be added to the documents. you can find everything from a final volume up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for you. you are a collection of various documents, which can be arranged in a file structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. at present there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure after platters (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As template - save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, you notice that (even if it is stored as a project template) the template does not appear in the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click file as a template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be moved with pulling on the site template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only based in a template folder. it can be used all file management functions such as pulling and add or insert about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select a file in the file tree or in the repository files to create a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, a name for template will be secured, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very fast-oriented approach. you can add headlines and footlines or dynamically together with & PHP, creating files, add files or linked with them. additionally, some Things can keep on using templates very profound in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The basic structure in the lower window Templates is based on the files based in $KDEDIR / Interpreting and $HOME / .kde / Sata / Templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to define the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and to choose Properties tab in the context menu Properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selfle can be blended, as soon as the attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders. if a master folder would have been set, it would appear templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the Blah would appear with something like Text-Baustein. if nothing appears, it is probably found in a master folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows leading or reprinted text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or foot parts for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying attachments to a folder with special headlines / foot lines are already compatible with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the context menu (indicated on the right button mouse button) on a full command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Beaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which are accessible via the menu views. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divide the editors in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor is as follows: it invites you to edit a document like a normal & HTML; - or and a cursor. then you can edit and run as required source code editor, where the implemented changes in the source code can be seen in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor to a document that contains & PHP; it shows a small green symbol of the Vohandy of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. it is also possible to edit it directly with the VPL editor. there is no plans to change these behavioural.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, but that at the same time runs both in the source code editor and in VPL; editor are visible, and the cursor is activated in the source code editor and in VPL; editor is already active, the key transfer of the active cursor of a window to the others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. according to choice of VPL; -view it can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set in addition to a small range for fast calculator and a large range for slow motion.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. why & diff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated, because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously changes to many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was many conflicts involving clamps.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by myself only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no indications of the digits, where perhaps only the influence had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in one line and changes to white characters. later, lots of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare fast text, copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-called file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is also supported by two-way clamps. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece code and change changes. the merge editor below the differences of conflicts allows the dissolving outcome. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. this editor shows three quell files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diff3; helps you also complete the same and merging file. this screen photo shows & diff3; with the folder assemble:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; shows the exact differences and divises the possibilities of today's paint monitors. if you often have Kode check, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are visibly displayed. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see this on a glance at the column on the left side. (no trouble changes if nobody changes the back.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates what file is different. red color means that both of files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are named the same name, but in different folders, you can use the Tippwork by using only the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 2 file folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder with folder 2 folder with folder 2 folder with folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual entry to file names, select the selection of file browser (file...) or select a last modified file from the list box. the opening dialog will give you a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folder... you can also choose a folder. if you choose a folder, the same or merge folder will be selected. if you choose a file, then used B and C, but use a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When interactions are crossed, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to define a output file immediately. you can do this step later at saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set the options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would not want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard. in the open dialog you will need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the breaking button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also arrange toes and query: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from one editor and let it fall over a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions. if you would like to figure out these features, that would have to create two corresponding files, they would need to copy two corresponding files. now you can copy the relevant sections simply, then add and compare these functions.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can remove nothing from & kdiff3; only the all-step text is supported in a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and disassembling of text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and inserting). in such cases your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window lies the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that windows C is optional.) Each Info has to rest a while on line. then a small utility window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees the color which differs in. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the connection column is displayed. if differences were found, the color shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful only to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + +, are white characters only in strings and comments, for the preprocessors and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the abstraction column from the text, is interrupted in the digits, where the source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line is displayed in broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (below the reference window) also has an Info-line with the inscription:, the filenames and [Gechanges] if you handled the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, the Save is disabled!!! (use knobs jumps to the next / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference at the same time has to be resolved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is indicated. this group will then be highlighted at the beginning of the group.) This batch is then highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted by the color background color for the current section and on the left hand appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes you have left the automatic crash or do no more line in the group; then there is only one space holder for the case that you may change your opinion and maybe yet another source. this text appears not in the final stored file, nor in a mark that you may copy and add elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & paste; collusion layer; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the window window. do cautious with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if in selecting the sources the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the picture-run and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are using in one of the window, you can use the arrow buttons left, right, end, Strg-beginning and strg-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the oversight column in addition to the vertical frame bar can be used by clicking on the navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to work with the insertion mode. (default is set-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A button with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective Group (as already in the section together and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl / Ctrl picture downward) or to the next / ancient conflict (Ctrl / Ctrl picture) or to the next / last unsolved conflicts could continue to be considered as conflict. therefore, there must be differences between dissolved and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you have to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this is enabled, the option is automatically copied to the clipboard and copy the manual copying. be careful with this option but you could accidentally copy the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Connections are saved according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants are using a line feed unit\, and Win32-based systems use car back-feed + Zeilenschub\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retains the sources of source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restoring in the next start. (menu entries &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog has variable width with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in curve sequences are displayed. if the selected script does not support this representation doesn't happen anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be scaled automatically. on these systems the button settings automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, pressing the tab button to insert the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you enter input or return, the inclusion of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, you will automatically copy any selection into the clipboard. then copy the manual into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which Zeilenende type you prefer to save. the default value is the common choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files on the same files, & diff3; first, all identical lines can be ignored in source files. the second step compares white characters. the second step compares white characters. in this step, white signs will not ignore white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car back sign '\' at the end of one line, other again save only a line feed card '\'. usually ignores & kdiff3; however, if this option is enabled, they are disabled with different sizes in side-to-side comparison, but like a white characters. during this option, this option has to be disabled. in the default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default option is disabled. changes in comments are dealt with white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely after even smaller downstairs. the option is enabled in the default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly for very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically Still-Run mode, this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is passed before the next unsolved conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">If you need automatically, if white characters are used as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you require white characters in many files. please note that the automatic selection also includes conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comment.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options will be explained in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merging. look for details below document-comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already a older version exists, then the original version is suffix .original hung. if already a such backlog file with the suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. the changing of this option does not refer to the current program. you need & kdiff3; complete and restart to change the change. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally across the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if one activates this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection dialog for encoding a short notice, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. as coding for each file can be adjusted individually, can be compared with different encoding and can be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">In case you have machined a file, you can define what encoding should be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could deal with 16-bit ASCII) with this option one can set the coding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off immediately to suppress the highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignored C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a colour coded Crossing column are displayed. but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files. according to the selection of A & B; -s; C or B & lt; -s; C will be displayed next to the normal, a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space for long lines. you simply select the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window by side or overlapping. this option can also be useful for advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files together. a simple click brings together the merge and uses the filenames of the last source file as the pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to run the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will hand over this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preset, which corresponds to your needs. you can use this function such as removable parts or to correct adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will be referred to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the edition of the command is used only when using this template. you can write your own preset, which corresponds to your needs. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to enable users more flexibility to setup the Diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most user would like to program the good news. however, the good news is, however, that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line abouts to convert the input in uppercase: SED '\\\\ 1 / 'This is an ergent expression on any character string, and in this connection, all characters in one line refers to the found text in the first clammernsfew. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to include automatic keywords:\\ '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you might get to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar items.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignored numbers are actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line abnormalities. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'each sign between' ['and'] 'is a matches, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several variants at one time. then, you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the goals of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -s / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'However, if SED\\ (and\\) needs only, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal pre-processor are kept for the display and to merge. the other operations change only the data that sees the line-down algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal pre-processor, the Zeilenabo-Prev is the output of the normal pre-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changes or differences, you can't see accidentally particular differences and destroy in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers must edit many files in one folder. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before departure,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the interaction and displays the simulated changes to do without it.</seg>
<seg id="2364">... select selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merging of individual files. you need to specify only folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders can be merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination is specified, use & diff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, do not lead the interaction. to initiate the interaction, select the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will inform you a small news window on current progress. when you break down the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, & diff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder that was found in the Scan can be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The file structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or to the object buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions, all subdirectories can open, where you can open all folders or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file will start the file and it appears a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file type is different from the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case the cluthr action can not be chosen automatically. if the merger is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown above the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Files are considered identical when their complete content is identical. then you have the same color. when folders, the age is unconsiderable for his color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictive data types. as long as such flaw objects exist, the merging can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictive data types. as long as such flaw objects exist, the merging can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target file are given and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action will be identical to that both folders. if you select one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result into two folders. (the user looks like the visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after the merge & diff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders can be combined and the option new file instead of merge (uncertain) activates & kdiff3; the date of files and traces the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merging can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging a file is executed one file after the others. a status-column shows ferrous when the merge has been successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected. if the merger is completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is fine.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the text dialog is chosen for a complete analysis of complete analysis, it will show diff3 other columns. these include the number of unforter, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soluble conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at one time. if you have selected all the cluthr actions (even in all sub-folders), you can run the interaction.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have no destination file, then the three-folder converse mode C is used as target, when two-folder converse will be used as target and when synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed at the destination, even in the file structure. there are some options to overpass the certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). in order to merge only the current entry, choose the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory file types still invalid merge actions exist, a message appears that indicates defective items. you can choose a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you come together all the entries, a dialog window appears with the options to perform simulate and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulation if you would like to see what would happen, without which really changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge of a single file), then a clining window will open (observe the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, choose the directory entry / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list see some error messages that you should start to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you continue with the interaction.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and does not lead them again. even if the merge operation has been changed or not saved, these entries will be done as done. only if you have the interaction action, these entries will be regrouped once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory entry with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are shown on the printed pattern are displayed in the element tree. they can be entered into the element tree. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp. * .h). the default file is *. file must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as partition. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as partition. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that will be ignored by CVS. many autopmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder was file specific using a .cvSignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvSignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems select a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links indicate. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links are treated as normal folders and recursively searches. (note that a link to a folder on itself) would lead to a final loop and (& diff3;) This option is switched off at the default location.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Results in a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, uncommodities, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when they contain files on files. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare great folders through a slow network, it is possibly faster to compare the change date and file size. however, this speed limit costs you however a certain level of safety. please note with caution. this option is due in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there's no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical when they are equal to. i.e., such can be useful when copying the change date. please note with caution. this option is checked in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folders. in this mode, the proposals are identical to that. even the results from the merging files are stored in both folders. this option is displayed in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered to be unsafe, because the other file is not changed also.) This option is displayed in default.) This option is displayed in the default location.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file, then the original version is renamed and will get the extension .original If an old backup file with the .original button already exists, this will also affect the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging all folders. this option is enabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view would be visible to the interaction of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the folder & text window, the main window will divide the window in the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer a file simply to compare with double-click menu. however, there is a single file also to merge into the merge menu. once you save the folder, the status will be done to the merge and the file will not be merged when you start folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost when you read the directory once again: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax than local files and folders. some Things should be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or... that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file containing the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system, sometimes through the protocol used, there is a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder. then a file is accepted as link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date from the original. (please note the option of the size.) (This is only for local files possible.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently used as the differences of the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop always start the built-in differences of diffuser. to display KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences of the viewer and then select In KDiff3part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & diff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as KPart, & diff3; on that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program then starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can select a patch file and choose from the context menu preview - KDiff3part. please note that this doesn't work if does not work the original files. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since production of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as Part 1, it supports only the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merging or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heis the prepare) already exists. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can lead to the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use the GPL programs very long and have learned a lot to look into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone this path or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have probably compiled the program from the sources and the configure prefix to KDE. preference installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for user interfaces (e. g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters vary, these lines will also be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is treated differently, the line will not be identical. if VLines! next to Each other, this is the case of this pis.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The Editor refers to any difference in files where it starts and where it ends. this important information is lost, however, if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could save that information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to handle larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, no src lins; it appeared and the text can't be extinguish. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; has already been using many colors to produce goodbye. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please do not use any other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and fault reports came by colleagues and many people from the Wild game web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all features of & kdiff3; you will need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & install on a system with & kde; install and install the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-thyself gives the folder in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems when compile. should, however, please take problems, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut off (Ctrl-X or reversing), copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or reverse inserting) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaced the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences show: files that are identical in all folders, and therefore do not appear on the folder, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you must re-read the folder with the function of updates)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences may have. this also causes that identical files when merging can't be copied to the target folder. if the target folder will not change these files. (the behavior is probably modified in a later program version probably.) This option is displayed in the default program.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already available), if the lines are already available, clicking on the button once again.</seg>
<seg id="2449">The default option is disabled; the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minishow of all virtual workplaces. it's quite convenient to see the ongoing programmes running on the work surfaces, to change its size, or move it. this works both within a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual workspace as well as the applications running in running. applications can be selected and even be moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the medium mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager; clicked on a application within & kpager; clicked on the symbol and the name of the application as well as entries minimize, maximize, in mind and finish. the following commands are:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of mind. appears only if you clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. it appears only if you click on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & kpager can be moved with the medium mouse button on the desktop and also on other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, are displayed in the & kpager; the names of virtual working surfaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & kpager to display the numbers of virtual workspaces. it is associated with name advertisements, provided the names with ordained, & eg; 1. work.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will be shown as a background in & kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small window in & kpager; otherwise only the empty space areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected, just shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with its standard symbol and Pixmap. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; main window is determined: classic & kpager; in a 2x1 grid, all virtual working areas appear in a horizontal and perpendicular in a vertical range, which is very good for the presentation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to Pager MiniProgram in Control Bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with their content and move it outside the Control Bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent selecting the switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can't be changed in the dialog for Settings .You can do this manually.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must register to your system administrator. in this file, you must register the key windowTransparent mode and assign to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like & kmag, a window appears as pictured above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window appears as magnification window. the picture that appears in the magnification window is a enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the standard settings can be enlarged and kish; the area around the mouse pointer looks like an moveable lap. alternatively, you can get a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection mode) or the surrounding of the mouse pointer at the screen edge (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointer in the extended window, select the mouse pointer in the extended window, please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can adjust the selection window to your needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouth buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can move the contents of the magnification window and move it with the arrow buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you also press the & Shift; press the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. keep in mind that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain and only the lower right corner is left.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse pointer a while on the same spot. it is thought to help people who emulate the repetitive strain of the panel (RSI) Syndrome and that each mouse is emulate with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain, which arises during the click of mouse and helps to use so many people who are caused without pain. unfortunately, you suffer from painful manifestation because of your computer. unfortunately, you should call a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it even though: even if & kmousetool; pains avoid pains that are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which are caused by the mouse due to the mouse. and as with all ergonomic options, the result can vary depending on the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and leads a mouse click away once you break the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent move activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, until the end of the mouse, it will wait until the end of the mouse button. in this way you can move the pulling in pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires little exercise, but you get used to get used.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This account time must go after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it's turned on, the rotation field is switched off (1 / 10 s). here the time is shut down, the & kmousetool will wait, before the mouse is waiting to get rid of the mouse, if there is no use due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; this function is enabled by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, one click with right mouse button. a slow motion to the left and back, followed by a button. these movements are recorded in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delays, you can move & kde; to move the response time, go to Sound & Multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider's generel. there is a slider sound buffer that you can reduce the response times to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at every start of & kde; this function is currently available under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments please refer to the respective documentation as you start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values set down when opening the dialog. have already pressed the button to use the settings, the settings will be reset to the state after pressing the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best you use & kmousetool; initially with the presets. especially the intelligent shifting should first be switched off. if you click to the automatic mouse click, you can remove the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; if you have to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should make sure to do a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral density of windows or on digits in the browser window that doesn't display link, leads not to unintentional reactions. you can therefore use the mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is jerky, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the castors that come into contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you must take out the mouse ball. like this happens, mouse to mouse is different. but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the sphere, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and soiling can be scratched by a shallow blade or the fingernes.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system boots the execution of & kmousetool. if you just use the intelligent move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation cannot be ending over the lot of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move it into a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists in that you can run a mouse click. this is due to the status of & kmousetool; set aside and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, trying to execute & kmousetool; continue to execute the cursor position and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there, where you want to have. but park the mouse on a neutral sphere of mind when you're going to make a key action. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the titlelines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shifting, but I don't create it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you get to move it into the clipboard, to move it into the clipboard, where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but there will probably be some problems with you. here are some advice about this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shipping if you just start to start & kmousetool; use this text instead as follows: perform the switch pressed while using a mouse button at the end of the text, while you move the mouse button at the other end of the text and recompute the mouse button once again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this allows you to retrieve a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when in the smart shifting the shifting time begins. later you can use the smart shifting even without the audible mouse click. but do you need it for some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; it should be installed in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse functionality is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker and are set up properly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; put the mouse button once the mouse pointer shortly after the mouse pointer. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and who prepares the fathing of the mouth keys.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured as it is a certain time for waiting that a pulling process begins, before the mouse is released. in this way, the dragging and shutting can be carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "Movie-dispatcher" works with a text, distinguishes among four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen readers has the highest priority. it will be written to all other applications and will keep these orders. if the output of the Screen Reader is pre-read, orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is too hot. a warning has priority and holds the edition of news and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">They have the next top priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that's messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page, you can welcome you with & kmouth; someone welcome you can just enter the room. & kde; messages are also news. read.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text applications. each order that you hit from the card map orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that are used for text applications. text applications are thought for the issuing long texts that have no specific urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except the output of Screen readers. if an application sends out the output of a screen reader, during & rects; just such a precreads, this edition will hold and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen readers. they will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text applications as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and give it to the next filters. currently there are three kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. there are still further types of filters in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing board replacing parts of a text by other text. these parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions. it will be delivered to either words or as regular expressions as: -) by text or for the format of messages from & conversation; or by mail; or, in a better comprehensible form.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters can be applied in accordance with which it is applied for a voice output. if the filter stipulates that his rules cannot be found, the text remains unchanged at the next filter.</seg>

<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is too hot. a warning keeps the edition of news and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that's messages out. if you & eg. just a long text on a web page, you can welcome you with & kmouth; yet someone welcome you just enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Will create a text order through a message, warning or issue of a screen readers, add & ktts; the audio output in the maintenance-long one.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will then be played, if a normal text order is interrupted. if the introductory sound is active as well as an introductory message, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice message. this standard contains trademarks for controlling the voices, the volume, the gender number and pitch. in addition, brands for controlling the language of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently it supports & ktu; SSML only partially only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since it is the standard vote for the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or audio situation in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;% is regulated, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and Satisborders filters (SDB filter). SBDs must start reading, because only the first proposition must be credited, not the whole text order. thus, you can also go back on the map ticket orders, or stop and stop, even if the voice synthesizers are not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the boundary filters. at the first start of & ktops; it is automatically set up as a forwarding of the sound amplification filter. you can change its settings or add another set limitability filters, but inmates will not use it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the simplest, you will learn the setup of intercom selection and give text to the pre-read. check out the speaker selection once again, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed. in addition, you have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then, faster with the preview can start, since only the first movement can be processed, and not the whole text block, which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then hold text applications on the map card, or terminate it even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal Satisborders filter will automatically set up if you can not switch for the first time. it can not be removed only. do not change anything at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satzlimitonal filters compare with a regular expression for Satzend and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set boundaries (Tabimalcode 8) from the filtering automatically. please note that the standard Satisborders filter must be the character release.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied on & kde; messages (kward), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from considering the normal Satzboundary filter, you can insert this again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file; it contains the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">Card allows you to transfer the speaker settings for application. the card card is displayed if the card is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on board card speaker). with other words: no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most passable speaker, which shows all the properties of a speaker. if you choose to delete or edit the speaker; otherwise select & ktachts; the speaker from the thest the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired office features by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Please select the properties of the required spokesperson. if this feature is no part, you do not provide anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property is priority to other features. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the issue of the issue, this feature is seldom used as a prime property. however, the only case you might want to specify the attribute language, if you may know that a specific application text in another language is sent when working in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the subject of speakers, which is to be able to delete the following above, click on the select standard driver and then use on speakers that corresponds to the following:</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 corresponds to the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number is the input 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Sounds immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Gstreamer is crashed and is closed. probably you have to record GStreamer 0.8.x is the command gst-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, probably a non-compliant version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA doesn't work when I play a text order with another application. if I hold a text order, friert & ktops; a message that says: pto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">In your system, the problem is that conflicts have been appearing at ALSA, which will prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. references for potential solutions will be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-projection.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an extra voice from the internet. I installed it and can't use it in Festival, but ktmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add a new voice in the file $KDEHOME / Takeover / ktops / Voices. as a guide you can add to the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; if you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">At the card audio, there is a setting speed. in order that this works, the program SOx will be installed and used over the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers module such as Festival games offer a setup for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed are ignored, if & ktts; & HTML; read the HTML in SSML. SSML has own tags that the speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or if you're very courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to the SSML conversion filter, and set the microphone speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't create that websites are pre-read with a female voice. I have furnished a female festival speaker, but & ktts; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the Day Sable Gender does not seem to work. thus, the XSL file sets the XSL file for converting SSML according to SABER the gender tags. the same applies also to VOICE tags.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf; one module for the & kcontrol center, which enables the management of network interfaces, the routings and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter, allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a single, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter can be accessed by selecting the K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter is displayed; the network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selection of kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers have to be able to install and configure, thus & knetworkconf; the device ever displays and adjust the settings of the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are install on installing & Linux; with installed and set up. network devices later added, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings can be loaded, if the network settings are selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected to automatically detect the used platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the board selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release date. by selecting the setting non-again questions, the definition can be met permanently. during next start of network settings, this selection will automatically default to default.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings can be displayed only in system management mode. previously, all options can be considered, the settings can be considered only visible. in system management mode the settings can be viewed at the right end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password mode.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode, which is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the rider network interfaces can be performed by the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the network interfaces can be setup by selecting the desired tool in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box will be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button to view the dialog with further ways.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option of automation, TCP / IP settings are brought from a DHCP server or BOOTP servers. in addition, the TCP / IP information system sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual may be made without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be set. in the input field network mask is the subnetmask set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialized the network interface in booting. if the initialization is not allowed, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog appears as the properties of the device in the box list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an already existing IP address would result into a TCP / IP conflict. using ping in the & console; you can determine whether the default address is already being asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be switched on or off on demand. switching to an integrated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be switched on or off on demand. switch off of an activated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">The IP address of the machine is fixed in the local subnet, which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If your computer is more than a network interface, the interface has to be selected to the network where the gateway is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">One machine with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers only can only understand IP addresses. if computers are only IP addresses. if computers are only IP addresses, it dissolves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the questrian name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be removed, removed or modified on.DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract and up or down in the list with the buttons up or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button... from the group computer to name resolution can be added a DNS server. it will add the New name server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Adding. the entry will then be added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group computer to select the name resolution you choose a entry and then click on the button.... It will be the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known calculator describes the computer name-to-IP address settings for TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting, if no DNS server are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of well-known calculator contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses will still support. this still requires the current version of IP in future 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known host and click Add.... The dialog New alias is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, which you can download the newest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packets) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in one & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with graphical user can be used as a package or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development box with libraries and libraries are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology is outlined, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; binary configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network are conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 has never found large spread. IPv6 is expected to go through the near future. this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign network drives, at & eg. workplace is the network administrator the response time, which is available to a valid IP address, or if it is available, the IP address can be selected as arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When putting an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from an especially reserved area for this purpose, to avoid IP address lines with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, the addresses are usually used in the 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are connected to the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the standard route is required for the IP-forward line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local press. usually the address is 127.0.0.1 an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in several distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed to DSL connections, so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections a other content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE Linux, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand can be found as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2924">For all folders that are under backup files, only the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. file that can be found on other file systems. each entry is deleted by tar regardless of the other file systems.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used for setting the changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Remove the snapshot file from the call from tar. this causes that all the files are secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>

<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is mounted, the command is mounted to the drive. some of the drives can be performed before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, you tried & dat; the throw at the tape drive. possibly this setting is not working with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when triggers the integration of & kdat, the band is automatically exposed; use this option not at Floppy-streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, you tried & dat; the hardware-specific block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to log & vdat; in any case the log size for your belt runs.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a band is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only a memory block on the volume. the file's content is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N byte) The volume ID. the format of this sequence is the computer name: seconds, whereby the computer name is the complete name of the system, on which the volume has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds since the time has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to use a file containing the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar -archives that are directly integrated with & GNU; - tar to manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not have to incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& b system log; helps users to understand what your calculator is in the background. the task is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system sends the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & kscutter log; experienced users have access to information about problems appearing on their server. I try to provide some enhanced features that will be filtered and evaluated using the protocol of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 features & kscutter log; a number of useful functions. these include amongst others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included, and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksb log; features available, with their help, the individual protocol lines of a protocol file are easy to filter and sort; the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & B loglog log; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not appear, and it will run out of its system administrator right. the protocol files will normally be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user to have no authorization to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filtering the filtering system according to the selected filter system. in the default setting, the selection box contains the entry settings all. then a protocol line is displayed only when in one of the columns contain the strings of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. select the character string of the filter search phrase in the corresponding column. in the protocol, select the name of the process, and carry out the log log; all the protocol lines, which were sent or compiled by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you recognize the key protocol lines. Protocol lines of the Level Error are displayed with a showy colour as a protocol-rows of the stage. display lines can be switched to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in system protocol or in cron Protocol), you can then be able to check the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the To new lines in the context menu of the master window to view all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& B loglog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. in order to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindows, select a protocol from the menu to display.</seg>

<seg id="2958">I'm not going to enter into historical aspects (such as I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone may try to implement a machine on System V Init without creating a reinstallation and new format. therefore you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there, if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also distinguishes itself from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is rc.sysinit and the following other file:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a lot of scripts. basically, you need to run a script for each system service which you want to run at the start of the system or change onto another runlevel. system services include such things such as offset, NFS, & shipping;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such items such as setserial that is only started. such calls include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.cc.d should lie if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is actually not much use for this. you can also use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for various places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can throw at a glance into the second column and probably realise that the pre-set round level 3 is done. if you want to change this, then you can fix your / etc / inittab. if you have somewhat confused, then come to restart it by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it begin to enter all the proper scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that no real files are located in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to a scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? easy: each of the scripts are written so that there is a argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts in action by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one K includes, the script will be called off. if it includes an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could & go; a server-Runlevel, that can run only httpd, & shipmail;, network & etc; I also could have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to trivial. simply drag one entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six rounds to start at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move a script from Runleveling or modify the position within a level by moving it anywhere. in this way, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they pull out a entry from the availability of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved to move in a new area. in order to copy them to a new runlevel, you must simply select copying from the menu item and then add in the target area -- even then, when the same entry has already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number one can't be calculated sometimes. in such a case you will need to edit the sorter numbers of the modified entries before trying to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore entries, which have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to enable the various working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and cursor keys to meet a selection above or below the previous data.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another runlevel, move it with cut out into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired round level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the number or names of this entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. connect the dialog button to accept the dialog button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discern the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the danger of data loss all entries in the menu file would require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / Trigger / config / ksysvrc) are taken if they are available from & ksysv; otherwise, changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've tried with the standard runlevelling, and now the machine will be new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; available under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type, such as system services in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan a extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution list, please verify whether all configuration files are required (and even if they are located in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply without message if their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be from version to version differently. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you will need to save them. either use the respective icon of toolbar or entry Save In menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, the user and user user ranking. to the edit, select the wanted user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user and group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some boxes can only be displayed if you have enlarged system settings. only if you have allowed restrictions (Quota) for users, it will appear to make individual settings. other cards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD uniform.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card fits, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd can be installed in BSD unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card is only activated, if required for at least one embedded file system limits (Quota) and initialized (can be seen at the quoted quotas user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change the limits for each user parameters in KB.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for any file system. the current file system will be selected by means of the field file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informs about the group of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field of primitive group. furthermore, the user can join in other groups by marking these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties tab contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, adding from the menu user or group or click the matching add-button of the tool bar. the editing or deleting of the selected user or the selected group is analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove operating systems, change and more.</seg>
