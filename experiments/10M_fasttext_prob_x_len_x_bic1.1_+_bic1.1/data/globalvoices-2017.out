although I had visited the United States at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is exceedingly great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American films , I read American music , American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had a massive impact on me that I was mainly because of a US film journalist .
when I was 14 years old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gar@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ porter , who was covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ Student , the Supreme Court of the judges who had scattered his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if that the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I was living in Arizona , my ad@@ mir@@ ation had been reinforced for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so del@@ ight@@ ful that you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had written a very funny letter of love about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the host@@ ility and rac@@ ism of this man .
the exceptional aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he is surrounded with its narrow face .
he never stops with his mind , as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he think , as a former colleague told it , and publicly declared his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ica and Women .
yet people responded to his statements and approved in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support this big@@ pri@@ x person , asked me ?
I could not get tr@@ ump and his elec@@ torate in harmony with the people that I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journal , invited people from all over the world , a deeply smoo@@ thing human being , with whom I managed to maintain Islam and his past .
in addition , Tr@@ um@@ ps also voted in line with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in order to look at the Phoenix S@@ uns .
Tr@@ um@@ ps int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family that I treated like her son .
it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me with a lot of patience and suffering from my colleagues to get acc@@ ust@@ omed to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those by them penet@@ rated my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they bring me a stop and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite or maybe because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the strug@@ gles with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they distributed either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were prepared to over@@ sight these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to draw the Tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ tors as a c@@ assi@@ sts .
to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ fic@@ i@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates a ability to understand the ones that act and think of a different way .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their municipalities .
could it be that these voters are supposed to have voted for tr@@ ump , because they would like to gain control over a country that has dis@@ appointed it ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps too .
however , one can hardly forget David Rem@@ n@@ ick &apos;s words , who sees the cruel decision to raise a man with regard to those who look down differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . O@@ B ) : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of White against all other Eth@@ ni@@ as &quot; ; word game from white in attacks on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what is the great Van Jones called as it did so great to America so great .
million people around the world estimate the American Ideal - whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have , America is definitely welcome .
for this country chose as his pre@@ sidents , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , anywhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there &apos;s a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with Th@@ rough@@ ness , Relig@@ ious freedom and all the term of Pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the resting place , they say .
with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a voc@@ abul@@ ary with the crowd .
Donald Tr@@ ump , could my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn took a place in your Americas ? &quot; ask Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ ushed the amount .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they responded .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out and their voices were loud .
&quot; could anyone , who doesn &apos;t like to have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
he received a voting and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God be than@@ ked , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t this America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , told the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no more place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ a@@ ean town Cat@@ e@@ ura in common ?
that the music that is played in both places does not only have the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby medieval ruins and world famous kitchen .
for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the community : one from children and an adult existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments to overcome poverty .
a musical school of 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs @-@ abuse and the band violence .
but this changed after an acci@@ dental meeting with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had ever built a rare hopes .
the young band members take away their obligations towards the musical group , the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI comments :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to attend their great passion .
you always arrive aw@@ ning and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music made of rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on , on the instruments which are made from recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments made of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop of musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er started to turn into instruments under the bat@@ on of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ated cov@@ ings , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , trumpets , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all from the gar@@ bage were manufactured .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , of Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez is remin@@ is@@ cent of a local econom@@ ist and musician from the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning of time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and had to teach in the same place , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin was made out of waste .
today there is a complete orchest@@ ras that are made in instruments made of recycled material and calls itself The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary N@@ ames &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and live from him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they will transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spectac@@ le of litter music around the world .
the orchestra played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work successfully fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing was fighting .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that uses targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs in the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to joint use of Content .
at that time in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before leaving the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were displac@@ ed and inclined to be a little of the law from this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compres@@ sors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised himself against the ship . they refused to appoint one of its har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing treasure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that refused to remove everything &quot; , &quot; the Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ an F@@ isheries Agency . it is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s ship and persecuted .
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t possible to catch the fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia for pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects particular practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ) .
the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven out the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ ger Tru@@ sts En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , causing it extremely difficult to play . thus , the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
the deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by means of certain hab@@ itats and species , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a del@@ ik@@ ate balance .
however , during the actions against illegal fishing , the bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les were inter@@ fer@@ ed and also caused by the snow de@@ pri@@ o , so the actions nowadays in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange including lists of existing licenses , news , to susp@@ ects or more details , considering or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very atten@@ tive when they move on open sea with satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that fishing in forbidden areas - about such that point to suggest that a ship will load his caught fish on other ships .
in the ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries that are against illegal fishing catch , can refuse to accept such ships in their har@@ bors , meaning that the ships can not sell their cargo . and that they even could be forced to pay the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a re@@ union company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported by F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a completed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $ 20 million to lost sales , and lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i any year because of the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rating Eastern African waters .
East Africa is one of the most productive t@@ una fish stocks , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also , lower illegal fishermen .
among others , other promotions are among others like sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , speci@@ fying ph@@ as@@ ia seeds , f@@ ishings protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects .
it has been uncovered in criminal networks , who discovered counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several dec@@ eit@@ ful ident@@ ities and has found vol@@ at@@ ile ships and found .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Food Safety Authority , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances .
&quot; &quot; some of our studies show us quite well into the networks of organized crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to loc@@ alize ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s Wi @-@ Fi system , which is always developed , helps to hide the illegal vessels , like to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal fishermen use very ingen@@ ious techniques to conce@@ al their activities and to hide their position . &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st of Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , who also deals with f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships , for example , turn their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be loaded from satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various types of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help you to find criminal ships with larger precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Platform Global F@@ ishing Watch for the Global F@@ ishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; to gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who makes what &apos;s doing - that &apos;s just sense , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to bund@@ le their resources for the investigation .
we should do this global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system allows persecution of ships .
there is evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but they also deter them .
ships that explo@@ ited f@@ ences @-@ explo@@ ited and hardly with consequences did know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i involved a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries products , since then fishing boats are able to purchase more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 opened up doors , had the inspec@@ tors there on board towing nets , whose application is prohibited .

other countries make these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries joined together in 2015 , for so @-@ called west Africa Task Force . also , they fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to bring more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country passed its first major triumph in October : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was travelling under false flag . and not only the ship was operated without a license and were not allowed to have towing .
the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the start of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 it set a strong signs that they go against illegal fishing catch , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , evidence is such a particular , collab@@ orative work style to protect the oceans in the entire world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce recre@@ ated professional journ@@ alism and lives in London . there she is subject to the environment , technology and nutrition .

political and economic situation in the country deterior@@ ates continuously , what is noticeable in everyday life of the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans due to acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the revival of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro said the chance to have a basic change ; but finally , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes in its newest article the context of government decree as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate of the world belong to the highest in all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the country was to give the opportunity to re@@ capture its institutional structures and to include a new government alliance .

especially great waves beat the message about police repression in the central @-@ central town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the protest@@ ers came back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to susp@@ end police forces , including this woman in An@@ den@@ staat T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear a tube because anything else could see what many national@@ ities do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic about the round that forms the magnitude of suppression every day :

many representatives of the government had put the validity of the claim according to a minist@@ erial procedure in question - this has been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs include :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ sely .

others , this protests as a further step in the fight against a government , made out of their view little against the devastating economic crisis and thus deals with critical voices , said :

this is an adapted version of a interviews from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , which was previously published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ian city Córdoba .
as a now grown man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were committed to crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has not sought out his life .
starting with the citizens , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
at that time , I believed that was okay .
I felt like a feeling .
as a child of 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
I was not able to know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ im@@ er@@ cian . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the history of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , who was charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced in the course of the years , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent having his child , and as this child chose a way of redemption .
from the gym to the military base
when my father started to take me at the military base , I often walked into the sports hall . there I looked at home with a boy to fight the mar@@ tial sport .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later , he showed me a black and white photo , and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP .
pass just that they may not escape a day and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Tur@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the gym . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become a me@@ ar .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be OK . for so my Father had stri@@ pped me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degree , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ w@@ ai@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father gave me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to asc@@ end . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply all possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blan@@ ket for me and ordered to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were ar@@ isen and kept myself with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open room and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I par@@ aly@@ sed in and saw a couch for tor@@ tured on men .
she looks like a water@@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that she fortified the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been frozen .
they bin@@ ds a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs along the bed , over@@ flow@@ ed him with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ ital@@ ia .

the st@@ ank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ dy .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much sorrow ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were st@@ acked with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and to bind them .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were bound with the face down - all were bound at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people still swim in the matt@@ resses .
when my father saw that I saw at the cap@@ tives , he said , &quot; What do you look like ? &quot;
I met ? why did you bring me back ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and killed by soldiers , and was buried .
I know this , because my father told you at home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero turned out there a man and killed there .
( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la Ribera process , was also indicted by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former paper@@ clips .
the way , where you came in here , is the way that we arrived here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here they were changed their names and were assigned a number assigned to the process of de@@ formation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from above came that they should be transferred .
this was a lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all the possible stolen things home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that the spo@@ ils had a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military number , which one has fought against an enemy that is fought against him .

but when you enter into a house and to the refrigerator , record players , clothes , paintings , money ... , then there is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , could do with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I never would like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do it .
once he called me a crime and I said , &quot; You who clo@@ the cars on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded him , struck me , and he cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you back .
but let &apos;s need to know others !
that was my father .
I have no single memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of at that time , on which I put on a jacket and sn@@ ail swe@@ ater of wool . both I had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still produced clothes with home .
at that time acc@@ user accused me of having to have been a pity on this crime . I said , no problem , they can put to me a burden , what they wanted .
I was anyway there to speak .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ able act &apos;
now I know where I am older , I &apos;m Reu@@ e .
I have children . once only children have children , recognize the value of a life .
it is developing and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went much to say :
well , you did exc@@ use during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but to why the bodies let disappear ?
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
again I turned the question again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could not have been able to bring them into prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but to why make their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families who could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ able act which can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoner .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere where - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything else remains forever .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
just to declare it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea of trying my father was there during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made an accus@@ ations because of all of the atro@@ cities which I had to experience because of him .
then he said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no one put to death . &quot;
I felt internally displac@@ ed and asked me why all patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I cried out :
how can you tell what to tell me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you are forced to take part in a child .
he only said : well , I will show me . &quot;
exactly that did I .
in 2010 I saw the first advertisement .
I finally knew that he was a bur@@ gl@@ ar .
no one can submit to me that I was pre@@ occupied with my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 criminal off@@ ences : of which severe , un@@ lawful de@@ duction in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of under 10 years of child .

the sentences in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were witnesses , the historic La Per@@ la Ribera Process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Supp@@ res@@ sions were found guilty of crimes against humanity and in 28 cases , the court was sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ al in six cases .
eleven of originally 54 accused were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Perm Jud@@ gment : murder , Tort@@ ure and rape by a minister . # Es@@ war@@ heads of terrorism
all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military members , former police members and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti has been kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the Swiss Chamber of silence :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court decision is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations which have been working for many years on justice for victims .
Claudio Ab@@ ros@@ is , the lawyer &apos;s lawyer , was founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who became the children of people murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government handed over the country to the La Per@@ la , so there was a memorial to be erected here , which is to be re@@ directed by human rights organisations .

a translation errors makes older people in Kyoto for &quot; more terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers from a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month of witnesses of a very special translation .
in a shield , the Japanese word ( co@@ me@@ gen sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , probably , but maybe even with evil back@@ locks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; fe@@ ed@@ itable driver . &quot;
the wrong translation was on display in an electronic view from the 1st to 20th September at the entrance and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was shared in the social media .
the error was imp@@ eded by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware that the local newspapers made sure .
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an appreci@@ ation for elderly people and in an international town like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes &quot; said .
the def@@ ective English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture refers to the translation errors . she explained that the error was already contained in the text which it was checked by the translator and that the translation was not checked before it was published before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told me about the exc@@ use :
&quot; it &apos;s sorry that elderly people felt by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast news put a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; awesome &quot; older drivers in Japan , saying :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was off@@ ended as an un@@ reasonable description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but is quite anxi@@ ous for concern .
in the Kyoto region , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens filed 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of people caused by senior citizens increased in the same period .
the well @-@ mentioned re@@ porter gathered in the article published in the article comments of Article Comments on the Light , which show the preliminary parts of a Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is it not the reality ? &quot; isn &apos;t it the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; How bad is the translation not actually , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and over Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true foundation for these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation are diverse .
you need two major skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and knowledge the language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires active rule of target language - something that is in the case of mother@@ boards . generally , the convic@@ tion is that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - mother@@ boards .
this is why a French native language should translate from English to French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no employees in English as a mother tongue , which might have translations into English . this may definitely be lacking for the transfer , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can be attributed to Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees do have their work internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is the best thought to be translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
automatic translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the dist@@ illed and av@@ eng@@ ing sentences which are created by automatic translations , show that this technology can still replace a human translator . this applies to some languages altogether .
some of the stran@@ gest English For@@ bra@@ ids in Japan , among them also the en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated ess@@ prints , often used t @-@ shirts or bags , will be used only for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like wax still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but of large enterprises , or from the government that have funds to ensure greater standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto has hop@@ efully use a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ing measures on the Internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezuel@@ an Internet user demanded that they have no access to the Online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet array of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV could not be accessible anymore .
another online @-@ transmitter support recordings of the protests in Caracas , organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that resist@@ ed the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the task of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is chew@@ ed , and receiving the user , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers are closed again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay with internet access is popular primarily in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been counting on the coverage of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened with monetary policy and lock@@ ers when the Commission would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; calling for Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that this is even cheaper than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sine fil@@ in@@ tro confirmed that it is not only accessible via Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a pl@@ etion of domain name System ( DNS ) but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly continues its sessions .
earlier re@@ resear@@ ches of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that local Internet providers are using DNS via a technique which answer the DNS server on certain domains .
if a Internet is blocking by DNS , the server respon@@ ds incorrect or denied the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS release : @ el@@ ab@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ Camera was El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who was transmitted live in Caracas on Thursday .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was arrested in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV resum@@ ed on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by Internet connections : thereby , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians support access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will become a slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a son of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness testimonies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission from Kur@@ ham .
the following article is the slightly shortened version of a Short news report , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; ( &quot; F@@ eas@@ ine C@@ ess@@ ay Schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they were not together with the family , who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the University she once again returned to the house , and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the thing that has become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to work for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , they referred to Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a family with little money transfer their min@@ ating son or her min@@ ded daughter to another rich family . in exchange the child receives food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work which shall never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not raise up in the framework of a contract that cannot be raised .
in Paraguay , this is known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous human rights organisations use wide .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ me - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness statements , calculated and p@@ ran@@ ci@@ an .
she tried to call the things by name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , generally guarantees a stand@@ still in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
there is also the family , who decided to close their daughter in the faith that she will improve their position in society , and can make something out of itself , in which there is a different family .
on the other hand stands the family , who just@@ i@@ fies the girl with the faith and just@@ i@@ fies that someone would give you a chance that would never get any training and might even be hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced after many years later .
sometimes they even experienced it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú was hosp@@ ital@@ ized , her body showed traces of strong stro@@ kes . shortly after this she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former military national Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
by the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira was defeated by a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered a deadly injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they were concrete in mind that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl .
they designated the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there will be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ains .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of a couple and almost 60 civil society groups demanded an immense investigation on the case .
they wish that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be landmark - for the first time in the history of Paraguay an example of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as working forces , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , was able to register and lost his work .
their brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn .
it rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employer .
on Fridays , they pur@@ ified the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture , and the infected floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more time they were finished with learning , the more free time had her .
but this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for their emplo@@ yers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she was never hungry , but got not a limited meal . &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the library of the house@@ holder as food from the refrigerator , &quot; remember them .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the owner , a former military and sympath@@ izers from the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings of the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and leading position of the opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
thereby , he tried to convince them to give the reports to the official media about the regime &apos;s regime .
he stayed for intelligent , but didn &apos;t even stay with her . &quot; the st@@ ew@@ ard had found someone who heard about politics while he spoke about politics . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t allowed me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would again learn &quot; bad car@@ hab@@ its . &quot; that , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak to her mother tongue in Guar@@ ani .
her Lord feared that she would lose the formation of her , she may lose her .
she was however completely clear that she had received her hard work for everything she had paid for them .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ates . &quot; a matter of which almost never spoke , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to school when they go to school .
because the other children of parents may know them immediately , anyone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was unable to charge my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends origin@@ ate , I felt very clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
the company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group where people can share stages for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administration member of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter that plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
learn to learn .
please call you .
starting from Monday when possible .
the ad had five &quot; li@@ kes , &quot; and many comments .
a woman out of the town Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ ap@@ y girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also descended from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered their 15 @-@ year @-@ old Ni@@ kl@@ an . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third review , &quot; a girl from the state inside , &quot; had to work . &quot;
in addition , the authors of the authors replaced one ad :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her .

Bill law writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary parliamentary debate has recently approved a bill to &quot; the regul@@ ate concerning the use and use of social networks . &quot;
when he is accepted by Parliament , user workers have to register their social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law then a place will be set up , which is to be asked , citizens and citizens provide a permit to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law you would have to register their users on the site of the site with their correct name and number of staff numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it f@@ ails to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of fine .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as an &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others using voice , video recording and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set to pass , since the draft is passed , as the draft stip@@ ulates that they are able to register their users who are unable to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee the regulation on stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Swi@@ ar , Parliament , Member of the Legislative Decree , reported Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to come by the fire@@ wall to come across the fire@@ wall .
that could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those things , it would be necessary to submit to the Egyptians for Egyptians , to access the network .
but it is not so far known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the lecturer .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Institute ( in German &quot; Leader &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have strongly committed to the technical capacities and the understanding of the neither department in Egypt according to things that have to do with technology .
according to my opinion , they stand as well as it could also be done for ra@@ ining physical public and private rooms can also be done online .
if I take them seriously , then it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to prevent citizens necessary , or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of human beings , and to bring it to a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be approved as a law , the draft must first be discussed under the legislative elections and the constitutional changes before it enters the debate .
whether his assum@@ ption and termination is successful , or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military think of parliament , in whose sense the control is expected and ensured that no different sc@@ oring on the image surface is present &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the parliamentary stock of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a life imprisonment for those intended to thre@@ aten &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was published in the original based on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the contribution is published here as part of an agreement to the Content Sh@@ aring .
high above the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq work the animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza , and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Wal@@ ks to protect the spiritual Leop@@ ards .
there is a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which are mat@@ ured by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and fra@@ gment of their living space , as they always end@@ anger@@ ed .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian king is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory of the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and th@@ ri@@ ves of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video it shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza is pure joy .
when educ@@ ated Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate and other side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .
since six years , it has been involved in field studies to wild animals and on education programs of nature .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and assumes that protective zones for wildlife will be established in the Kurdistan region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the progress has been documented for the northeast Japan , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima caused the cat@@ astrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a pre@@ f@@ ect in Japan . the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami had to experience .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to van@@ ish because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map .
even so , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture even experienced a nuclear accident , so that &apos;s why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o indicates that progress has been reached after six years , in order to re@@ build the life of the local town .
the detailed report of the paper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing facility in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Newspaper is reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( p@@ its , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei , ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could see the biggest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined the closing light at 70 percent .
he still ende@@ av@@ oured to settle in final replacement houses six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated from accommodation ( people , cas@@ et@@ su Ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the final replacement houses .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such rooms .
almost 40 percent of the year 2011 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in Not@@ with@@ al . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated , which were earned after the disaster in accommodation packaging , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of the work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by mis@@ fortune , their doors opened up until December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
whereas almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are once again into operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have moved large @-@ scale construction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural surfaces , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and fewer than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a consequence of nuclear failure is , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares , destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear war@@ zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism essentially recovered again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off .
tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same stand as in the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , this is only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is difficult to earn their living content .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
to determine the overall impression , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked them about the status of the building and also how their indig@@ nation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident population , measures taken in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents have not yet done enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es health prevention .
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Newspaper has also been reinforced their attention to the location of the evacu@@ ated area of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had also been a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear in@@ let , in Japan ever had to experience .
almost 63 000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hima were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , which had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent spare parts .
after 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated areas , most of the evacu@@ ations are going to be more than 50 years old . they are to be rep@@ lied with massive building projects , because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games 2020 , which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences may first be bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while it is often noticeable that more than it seems to be at first sight .
these global connections are important since they call out our pre@@ ferences to expand our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that have often received less attention in coverage than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember at a moment if they have felt very strong with someone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ch E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love for music has devoured your lack of common language during a trip in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time where she has collected with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial Kom@@ a , after having been beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva is on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 brought this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday brought him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , with a protest against the head . nationwide rose million of protest@@ ers to a protest march against au@@ ster@@ ity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull of brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now translated him into a artificial compass .
his condition is considered crit@@ ically .
the local Image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz did photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus that rapidly spread to Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , which was identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the completion of the investigation into the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the M@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira &apos;s face ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by demonstr@@ ators and on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire op@@ pression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , sent a video on the net , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several san@@ itation shortly after it .
another video featuring the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also di@@ pped into social networks .
in the below shown clip one can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th of second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of State , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Braz@@ ilians Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover one part of the costs for medical treatment and to remain in the hospital in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while living in the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .
to viol@@ ate police . &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls further non@@ violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me joined Irish from his father because he had attacked the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and here was a occupied school of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen , having beaten him on his face by a polic@@ emen .
police over@@ lays
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived at demonstr@@ ators on the last Friday in the past Friday .
polic@@ emen set up a stage in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had prepared a stage for speakers , rubber mig@@ rat@@ ory and lac@@ ri@@ ves .
the de@@ pu@@ ties Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , imp@@ lo@@ red the police on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
it is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest in the country .
once again the Brazilian media traffic prot@@ ested by taking the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the fol@@ l@@ las de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported well over a cr@@ ush glass window to fit together with a photo of their cover pages .
in contrast , the O global@@ o preferred a title story with a burned bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about one broken window disc than the Prot@@ ests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also recogn@@ ise this if a stri@@ ct against any form of affairs is damaged .
also here the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical powers of the military police are backed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on a con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
die of The Ab@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ uts forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar pipes implemented in all Cuba the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the commune of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i , who is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of what there is no significant sugar content on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar pipe factories were laid out .
after developing the sugar pipe industry in the region , the factory lost gradually after its plants , until just the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some change the job .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to factories which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier veter@@ an , open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar pipe industry do not smoke its sleep .
he heard that there are in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which are again in operation after long in@@ active time , because they were obtained .
that was something , what he was not expected .
n@@ ene reminds of exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i the sugar tube factory would be obtained , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar pipe industry viol@@ ates the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for some decades before a reason for the land , but the poor harvest of the poor are no more enti@@ re@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane switched off ?
the old platform of the village saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar pipe industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar pipe factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they were not portable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which sug@@ ars for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar pipes and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased before about a decade ago .
from 2017 through 2025 , the cost of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar volume would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything worked well
&quot; the present day is going to go in history with security , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there , the process of re@@ structure in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills came out , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar pipe factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , it is the Word , which he is most repeated , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
to get the place , it formed a full time - working group .
before the First Trial Chamber , the first letters started to come .
it was officially written around the fact that only concerning the parts that would be removed , add@@ sat and the date are distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could sur@@ round any withdrawal .
and the letters were transferred from there and the letters were increasingly frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ up factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used sugar cane factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was in charge of his will at the stand@@ still laying of the factory , whose construction helped he helped .
with each part that he removed , he removed one of his 31 years of employment .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work of jobs was deleted .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located , were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present people saw that he was guaranteed for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar pipe factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has only been extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the people of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things change , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar pipe factory closed , or better when they began to throw them away , they also stopped working on paved road , also ad@@ den@@ ying other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region at once .
in the area , a food factory was created , its production is not even used for supplying the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
nin@@ ety @-@ forty min@@ ded the old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years after retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a Christmas person , yet he gives the lies that you told him not .
they have been offering him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years of age , not because it is missing on strength , but because he is being tor@@ tured .

first Nations yo@@ ungst@@ ers use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express itself and get their own culture
a song of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
you@@ ths of the first Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do so by Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of touring workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 workshop Manager mobile recording studios can accommodate directly to schools and youth centres to include youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agogue David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group The North@@ Stars worked together .
the workshop increases the fact that the young particip@@ ates in discussions related topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ front@@ ation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever you can find in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the yo@@ ungst@@ ers are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and became invited to organ@@ ise similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo in the field of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia is told , for example the story of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ hi Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to conv@@ ey , how important is the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by global@@ ization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not rule out the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation was accepted , the refra@@ in will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the yo@@ ungst@@ ers involved a bit of help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the fac@@ ebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in the heading , just a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like it would not ever be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to go on the earth my days
that is the day when you shall emb@@ race our scre@@ am .
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I think we will raise us up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead our adolesc@@ ence as well .
so you can do this for what it is the Creator

for most Japanese are those plastic dishes , usually they don &apos;t have any more money . a new trend is transformed today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets today .
in N@@ aver Mat@@ omas , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series published a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin of purple .
now in the special sale : new plastic stu@@ ff@@ ed plastic bands , such as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ es collectors , such as in this case , fridge t mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ c@@ hin refriger@@ ate for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences will increasingly become increasingly w@@ asted .
in this case an imper@@ ial @-@ don ( one popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
also this part is made for the Tokyo railway station .
and here is a apple , who hold your mobile :
designed to look like a Apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , it is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight to the Kom@@ ische .
some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon have betrayed , a popular t@@ opping with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can cr@@ ust my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appet@@ ite form , for example counter@@ parts or family members un@@ pleasant .
our newest mobile support has the shape of melting ice cream .
in addition there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and gloves made of dried salmon .
more sk@@ et@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes you can view on : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ter blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the quarter of C@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ itation .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against the organized crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of in@@ - and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; struggle against the drug trade &quot; in Mexico the missing and killed ones regularly occur in statistics . however , this reflected not the extent of human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
the coverage on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ al@@ oa Kart@@ ell , pushed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background .
on the day following a violent incident , someone looks back on the g@@ rief or to the churches that learned to live with pain .
behind every Lei@@ che , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healing .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , &quot; ) created a voice and told stories of people who were fighting for war crimes and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project such as :
organized crime leaves us not only for our lives .
the impact are much deeper .
for example , if stores close , because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ders and all municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometers in order to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear of life &quot; ) tell exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that seek@@ eth every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father &apos;s four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her neph@@ ew on a single day .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task today we have released to go , and to the graves after the people whom we loved are looking for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
on October 15th he was back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also with me here .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my Father , but it does not pay out to require a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those that are afraid . we must demonstrate the international community of conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state of the state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post in Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , in which form it appears :
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and Sens@@ ations journ@@ alism since several years .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day , and see the title pages with pictures depic@@ ting only from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or specialists from specialists .
it will bring me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only , or sad . it seems like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be considered valid or consider this as a normal case .
she further writes :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin think that he will be big ( German : drug dealer ) if it is great . and it is not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , that when they would have lost someone who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them .
I see our weak@@ nesses , if the stories come to a mere figures in a statistic .
the human el@@ ess@@ ness of mankind is incredibly for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified that they were &quot; excited . &quot;
I think they try to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such tragedy , if they are not stir and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the city district : &quot; as an armed crime was lo@@ oted as a family for month &apos;s money from their business until it was not only destroyed by the business , but also its family had torn apart .
you think everything you lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain per@@ verse over it , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the better we are removed , the better .
she graduated with the words :
we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to escape or kill yourself .
I asked myself in these terrible days , whether weeping would solve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to live . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence called &quot;
in the introduction he has asked questions , how to take care of the child of a little woman and a man who was murdered by organized crimes ?
what &apos;s it in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other young ones of his age , whose parents will take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells us that he had to teach himself , how to make an egg wh@@ it@@ ish , potatoes , Tort@@ illas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ac@@ ing with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are not important compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy who consists of violence and to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been past two years before , when he had only shot a few blocks from his home , the bloody f@@ are@@ che of his father , who was shot by armed men from an early running car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence through the organized crimes and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez is the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and the government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and enters into the soul of the country .
only few stories now live in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who have not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data created in 2015 , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug trade , which represented the country in the last four decades , in a compreh@@ en@@ sively manner .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring &apos;s Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this contribution and the pages for which he linked , include pictures where violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or or a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after it emerged about the first time ? content in social media , whether it is true or un@@ true , ten@@ ded to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it has been used to have been used to hold trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar in fact .
this wrong coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it th@@ rows questions about our desire to News .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker secured the place of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , and explo@@ ded about 230 people .
after the civil war , Africa became a second largest country of years neg@@ le@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become a dangerous path full of head@@ lights , which were difficult to ride .
the former tan@@ kers fell victim to the tan@@ kers .
public officials reported a fire soccer , dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , which was full of people who showed the soccer World Cup .
st@@ illed houses and carbon@@ ated bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to dis@@ comfort .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ic Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Frequ@@ ently photos of the approach form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of rough bodies , which are mounted on the ground during the people .
but here is the story not its end .
more than the years later , the same photo was put out several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , real but not associated with regard to trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the com@@ bat@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am took part in the un@@ le@@ ased village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eyel@@ ids reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities because they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and mor@@ n were used in streets and Bush .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people mass@@ ac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to count dead bodies , &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch .
many were tender , shot , or burned .
only based on satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army @-@ based in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the figure out of the DR Kongo on again , as a proof of the fact and the extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of Mis@@ sing descriptions ; Africa Check has been docum@@ ent@@ aries to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was submitted as a letter for mass soldiers .
still a step further bring personal comments as such as this example will f@@ avo@@ red the image from the DR Kongo on sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange has also occurred in connection with the persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a registry , published by the United Nations , those who could flee pun@@ ches , rape and some dead , some caused by burning .
while other of the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , Post@@ s appeared as the following : to summar@@ ise these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture is derived from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page that was due for 2012 , the president My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein also alleged that mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image of the DR Congo to hold this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 may be called here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P , as their source , had also been attributed to Th@@ an through this statement , but did not make the image taken in the DR Congo in connection with this statement .
the worldwide operating range of false information
traces of these de@@ coupling diameters dates back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
you can see how far more information can be exceeded with the help of a &quot; envelop@@ ed picture seeking ... &quot;
a envelop@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine in Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the discussed image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private parties , platforms of social media and community sites , as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some wrong reports have passed , and others tried to expos@@ e their counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have used examples of mis@@ use and it with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to display the range more distinct than by the language alone .
several examples of mis@@ used use can be used from the listed countries listed in some cases ( some cases also associated with each other ) .
here are some cases that can now be fully re@@ sp@@ ed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .

the orange countries refer to pages or server , some examples of the for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .

as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

in all these cases , which appeared significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture could possibly download a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( influences ) which are going through this post . the first frame focus on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in relation to the murdered Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of cru@@ el@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is subjected to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers will not support this pictures longer .
with social media there are nin@@ ety people who are un@@ inten@@ tional , the water around a tragedy .
suggested this mood with false and false information that real atro@@ cities are un@@ true and lubric@@ ated it the real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of massive pictures has already been made in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the back of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern is that for@@ ci@@ bly pictures and spect@@ ator des@@ po@@ ise and give them the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , seeking to help the for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss the discussions in the news media , fact that they are not indisp@@ ens@@ able for today &apos;s news reports .
techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will thoroughly thinking about situation in which a picture can be somewhat below , but in which it can be replaced by the context or in completely impro@@ per way .
any investigation of false grants should also be considered internationally as the internationally .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able ) vent@@ ures to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in every language : they press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ s@@ lows ) .
but all resist is persistent every attempt to a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for all time .
most of these lists treatment Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist , &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s sales language , as follows :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Wa@@ it yourself for your parents in recognition of how to satisfy you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - ease or sl@@ oth that is to be done after cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words in his blog About :
they grin@@ ders other cultures , un@@ cover other monuments and wake up our cur@@ ios@@ ity .
sometimes , you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of this &quot; un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages .

more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 secure tourist resorts .
the rainfall took place on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the rivers of water in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene rules of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astroph@@ ic disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka deliver regular updates for flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly fl@@ ut@@ ors sum@@ med up the crisis , the Children indicate the Children , after more rainy conditions are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in floods , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also over@@ flow@@ ed because of yesterday floo@@ ded the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a .
the Air Force has made five aircraft for emergency actions and five are completed by transport of emergency deliveries to the inhabitants completed in their over@@ floo@@ ded villages .
various organisations and start@@ ups have also been declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue sel@@ ector Dro@@ h@@ ens need for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for everyone who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 9@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 when animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ ir@@ ico @-@ App Pic@@ nic ( Sri Lanka ) asks for a person to share their s@@ iting data with the help of the app to inform the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ ell .
last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the tropical Storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; High @-@ water aid &quot; button that allows users to pick up a vehicle to pick up a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ot Red Cross .
similarly , they conducted a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which caused more than thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat trips for flood and land@@ slide persons .
the agreed efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , bring residents in need of security and aff@@ ord help .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way until the recovery of the norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21st of January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use appro@@ ached t.@@ Dam@@ than in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love .
I trust in her four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts to me , she is my rock in the surf .
in that one minute we call for more slo@@ gan@@ s for the rights of women .
in the next round we add rights for transactions .
we are located in a sea of paras@@ ols and people , some keep the ic@@ onic image of a woman with head cloth high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ en@@ ings par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
my gir@@ l@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Mus@@ h@@ a ? &quot; I ask myself .
I already led this conversation .
people , with whom I have been working or people who know me since years - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - by the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their presentation .
they for@@ c@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we thus identified to be a Muslim in different kind of art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims do not fit there , they are un@@ mixed .
un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed are mis@@ led
I get not alone .
that is even the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are coming in a sense when to think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was old as I am it now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western show the religion was deleted as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduc@@ tive images of Muslims who have already colon@@ ized the western books for centuries .
this loos@@ ening imag@@ ery is determined by the dark men whom you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid entered the history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but this pictures are still alive today .
but our polit@@ ician , the news industry , and Hollywood would continue .
I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , bad nar@@ rati@@ ves domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ vely over@@ sees the reality that nine Muslim women have carried away their countries during the last three decades , while the United States did not choose their first female Presi@@ dential candidates .
this Nar@@ rati@@ vely f@@ ails to recogn@@ ise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from taking their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and to cover the entire body by their government , which are both of the same coin .
a powerful group exercise his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others &quot; .
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ vely weak@@ ens Muslim women to lead movements for change .
it looks like this , that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ cans , who had been associated with slave hi@@ ps .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has seized our collective pre@@ ference power der@@ art deeply and def@@ ective , that often s@@ ik@@ h men and children to the goal of tim@@ acy attacks and ch@@ ik@@ an@@ ings are taken .
because of these stories , we tell and because of the kind , in which we tell it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we can do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we are also able to help nar@@ rati@@ ves the world to understand the world .
and my industry is said to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we are failed to see where seven million Muslims are in the highest grade &quot; various &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ham@@ let .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author was in New York in 1976 .
use approved .
four decades ago , my first parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother produced her first jew@@ ellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan failed the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were disp@@ ose of Muslims and Americans .
but am I un@@ ab@@ ated Mus@@ lim@@ a and US ?
sometimes , if people wonder why I don &apos;t want to pick up pi@@ g s@@ wine , I say - rather than my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ ful sound , all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ p@@ ah W@@ utz . &quot;
I sh@@ ear , we do not bear all hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ icks with us .
we must also be any the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to fight widespread lies over the Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islamic Chron@@ icles with Banknote Co@@ unter , Th@@ ink Tanks and Experts for Fal@@ ch@@ Information , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
due to the stories that we tell and because of the kind , in which we tell it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is more than just a fore@@ igner who stir@@ red the head cloth .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms sp@@ ends our affili@@ ation .
it affects our identity , so far it is so versatile and vari@@ ously that it can fit in a drawer .
the author was founded in 1986 on a picture of their kinder@@ gart@@ ner group .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born in Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Muslim was born only in my pre@@ conception until I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they take the following terms : believe , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior is not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neighbour , my neighbour , my rock in the surf that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , if they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air , that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ end@@ age rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept them in my arms , and you can listen to the Arabic verses to protect the grain and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
I pray therefore that they are protected from evil , evil , which can see and do evil , that cannot be seen .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim citizenship is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she won an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , with their sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother , the image of my grand@@ mother , with her sisters , as she was able to win a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi before decades .
it is the picture of her that I slept in this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi heal@@ er ; and one basket with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can close it almost .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers that she had said to me when I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a will be to me as she has taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who founded more than centuries - by a &quot; imperi@@ alism , &quot; which has founded a company with the name of de@@ cent British Ost@@ ini@@ ene @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep significance to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to , up , and to hear that men didn &apos;t cry , but at the same time to see that my father wept .
in a stop@@ over , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana j@@ aan is un@@ coated by his family in India , ruled that he could not close his arms in a half century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are million Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists like in my grandfather , who divided the Muslim world like the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have once added to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a Muslim country in a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an intimate , ash@@ mir@@ th under@@ tan of British imperi@@ alism , who was named as a &quot; dangerous &quot; newspapers , because he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he traveled to more parts of the world when I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , we go back into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess . our un@@ ab@@ used history .
it means that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed over any continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica which have gone into Iraq to pursue mass destruction of weapons that existed .
it means that more than half @-@ million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ moral rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy is drawn up by the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story of four times more reported as a story with a white bombing .
it means to know that four thousand years ago , the first prayer call , the A@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad , who had been conf@@ essed and brought into this land .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X name one American hero .
it is the heat that I feel like people crow@@ ded to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams , and if we say black life .
an American woman , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ lim@@ a , and a journalist , means the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of our unique ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate to others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in reducing ten@@ sions &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
one mother means to kill me and all the Muslim children , knowing that a powerful and privileged people were built on this principle of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia consists of the Muslim Tab@@ les which began with President Bush and to President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the Im@@ migration official , which takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that surro@@ unds its borders towards people from just the countries that are bom@@ bed it .
it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which occupies largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
we are the wars that we carry and the bombs that we throw at Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and because of them that we didn &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled as@@ ent of Man , scientists shown the North@@ western University of participants showed a scientific image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we must lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the other &quot; other . &quot;
we are going back to recogn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the fl@@ aw@@ ful and dangerous images that we stopped in our news editorial offices .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by US Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake SO@@ ME@@ THING , Say SO@@ ME@@ THING by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ er Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multiply Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ per - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing , in which we are located .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for finding conspi@@ racy the@@ ories which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown because Muslims have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ ential by having created the &quot; others &quot; .
a few years ago she had not yet given them ; now there are great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history I was not aware of , when I was so old as I was now my daughter , but I have made me today at an un@@ affected Mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I have left here like a post of bread track in my speech .
things that are perhaps memories , because in all the Inter@@ se@@ ctions held by our humanity , likes a story where someone is made to another &quot; others . &quot;
just now on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia took place .
more than a hundred university graduates speak about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms , with which we are usually in our schools for us or read them in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why did I count this with this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the oeu@@ vre of &quot; other &quot; in the public screening , four decades itself Scientific of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to put ourselves in@@ comfortable questions after the role of him , deliber@@ ately and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; because it is my gir@@ l@@ friend and I like in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he had been bombing a new future , while he already bom@@ bed a new future , while he already accounted for cap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; to others , &quot; people go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for National Art I wants to preserve urban diversity
history of history , certified by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be an option , here and now , despite a language barrier with som@@ ebody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported a short initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages should not be given to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we are going to make cities that have di@@ spar@@ ity - safe rooms where inhabitants must not forget to belong to .
while &quot; listen often is often associated to understand &quot; inter@@ sec@@ ting these events instead &quot; listen to , &quot; listen to feel . &quot;
in this format we need to explain their history first in their own language and explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional history , their dev@@ otion S.A. and their representation is that the audience as@@ cri@@ es to it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions , than the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which will be told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the story ad R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also sei@@ ze the opportunity to clari@@ fy the typical customs of the earth for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ able of the bun@@ ny and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after spending the meaning of his f@@ el , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ let , he shares his feeling of expression :
you have heard it !
they were aware ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organ@@ ise their own histor@@ ies .
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ fixing the state debt
with the aim of a new investigation of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started during the pu@@ ertor@@ ic@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital city , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ on of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Church of Puerto R@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the new debts of the debts have also submitted an appointment at the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is your demand :
the people of Puerto R@@ os calls for that the politicians , banks and government agencies , who are responsible for the debts of their corruption .
we request a financial inspection and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our work conditions , which led to the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their own .
we do not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be dis@@ closed with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require instant measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ of @-@ integrated territ@@ orial territory of the United States - suffered from a serious financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a government @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
without the participation , participation and participation of the citizens are at risk of being denied by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions here :

artist and writer writes the work of the missing Syrian designer Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi
Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ our@@ a .
photo of the fac@@ ebook page of N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian web company Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives filed their campaign for his freedom and remin@@ ders of the contributions that he has provided for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is held in Berlin , dedicated to an event in the # Free@@ zer campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , bub@@ bles from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ qu@@ eur ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published in the last year and is free here , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the presence of the repression .
there is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book wants to bor@@ row@@ ed how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true cost is to be associated with those .
activ@@ ist , artist , designers , developers , researchers , researchers and authors contributed to the movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to look over the fog , who around our news@@ fe@@ eds and create something in our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title College collective memory gives his friends and his family , who want to express his release and they want to know it back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us will start to thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions .
why Are We Today ?
what do we have chosen for ?
what do we have given extreme belie@@ fs in this process ?
since March 2012 , the web developer of open source and digital activity has been in custody for Syrian government agencies .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly heated &quot; command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as an in@@ sider of the Assad government and made them aware of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his position and condition remain unknown but still unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to know the audience around public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and at the moment of the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ &apos;s cultural prototypes predic@@ ts as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ constru@@ ct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the inter@@ section of numerous civil@@ izations and here the Greek Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started with this work , the IS would fulfil all that architecture who will not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ pping into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
Bas@@ sel has not yet been able to finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent all my life , of freedom for dre@@ aming and bas@@ sel taught me to emb@@ race her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought English to me , even when he had already been in jail .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he taught other coun@@ ties to read and speak to speak and speak .
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to bre@@ w@@ ed both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other things , as they ut@@ ili@@ ze computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having stopped one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a spent a year long together on the book .
she tast@@ ed the lyrics by him when she visited him and translated them out of the Arabic world .
the book is available for free .
book covers from Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I sin@@ tered in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the occup@@ ations in the moment , in which we always emb@@ race us ,
that each of the d@@ angers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ards
I forget the off@@ ence of the prison
and I go in every detail of your voice and words
which I wear with passion for myself ,
if your eyes will say Le@@ be@@ g
and I will leave another piece of my soul in you ...
I return soon to my sol@@ itude ,
to get all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
one year goes , my soul
during the event
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bass@@ el &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) have disappeared more than 65@@ ,000 people .
those who have been arrested or executed by the regime led by the regime , tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international Human Rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat today our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption condemn the Director at provisional release again

this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants to 22 million years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose council was appointed Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guided tour and promp@@ ted his re@@ mark to the company , which was then done on April 19 , then .
in accordance with an opinion from the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which subject to the request , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to acquire his old post , as the company was no discipline after his detention .
but many inhabitants will not see the action .
the Centre for Public Integration ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German Wave , the decision of the company , the director .
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP .
what we have noted that even the company should have set a discipline procedure against the resist@@ ors .
however , the company silent , however , conce@@ al no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; opposed &quot; :
when Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent body , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it .
he could pay discussions and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and polishing his image .
but since he is competent , he approved to re@@ integrate himself into the company , which he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is paid for his silence .
resist@@ ors !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political sciences in Brazil , says the director nor Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza , being rewarded from the state because he could not believe him , because someone claims someone in such a way that the state has already massi@@ vely increased .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ al to return and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served on the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used the state , as hand@@ some of an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired of this man , who was charged and finally condemned to a long sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t preferred the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief has been in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Moz@@ ambi@@ que will not only stay for ever an independent President in memory , but also as sharp , trimm@@ ing and - at the same time - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous represent@@ ations , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was unable to be able to sell his own amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ah said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not the case . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn off from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is a criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also dis@@ covering :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and came free of charge .
and today it sets him the company , where he is the money en@@ for@@ cing , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - for personal bel@@ lows - ( @ az@@ mal _ ra@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the ra@@ cial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored for many users
the Bur@@ m@@ pa@@ e word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means k@@ ich@@ i@@ se or age @-@ aging .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the renowned social network received their postcards from the net because they abst@@ ained the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or in general as ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tiv &quot; In@@ disch . &quot;
Facebook reports the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or , ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical writing ) as part of an initiative to view the widespread problem of the Hass@@ language in Burma in the social network .
in the past few years , the ascent of radical national@@ istic movements gave the word to an extremely se@@ ag@@ ant K@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ national@@ ists as a hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has increased a lot of more meaning@@ ful content on his platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word does not call themselves in Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that Post@@ s , where they discussed the use of the Word , or doubt for the purpose of his use , have been licensed .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence of letters such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( age @-@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; Cal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ate declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they were cr@@ ush , as he could reduce his back pain by making a word .
the set K@@ u la - &quot; cure &quot; ( K@@ u ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - is similar to the ra@@ cial expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that it is allowed to reduce their own language by radical national@@ ists , but he also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical to spread all the posters that did in the suspic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the automation will not understand what you are writing on fac@@ tor@@ ook .
as you should make it instead , check the post carefully and check it by checking the following words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age @-@ aging ) .
the good thing is that this three ck@@ ish national@@ ists , the Hass@@ ian speaking , will receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their national@@ ism .
while the action I like to send a strong signal to any of the Hass@@ elt , the efficiency of this strategy will not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship is often using a pit@@ cher and mouse game , whereby users can simply start social networks , a new word or alternative writing of cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to er@@ ase his poster when he only wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ex@@ iled by the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word was closed .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and given me the li@@ ken , post and parts of Content for 24 hours , because the Post Office says &quot; the Facebook Community Standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posters that have no negative inten@@ tions or just try to show their views against the hate radical national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post office has been removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme national@@ ism and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have had to do more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice :
Facebook likes a prosper@@ ous intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform but it does not work .
such words can be cen@@ sored , only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems , as if they started without any local context or technical support , and as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ dic@@ curr@@ y &quot; have been banned .
even when they found out that they did mist@@ akes , they did not temp@@ t the recovered poster .
if they could only have more respect for the 15 million people who would have reported a big revenue , the great deal would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has received a lot of users among users .
instead of taking it serious , users are talking about Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their postcards are taken away from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which contained no Hass@@ elt , but nevertheless removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese Text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the pe@@ dic@@ curr@@ y and watch a Indian movie .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , with hom@@ ologation .
the Post Office &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure mankind ? &quot;
screenshot , with hom@@ ologation .
over the last five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious foundations that have used social networks have increased to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt , in social networks , should act in addition to power in the congregations in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have been forced thousands of escape .
on Facebook , Facebook was critic@@ ised for its failure to bring out the hate hate on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than simply s@@ ati@@ ze the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better ongoing , particularly in context than code @-@ concentrated initiatives and lear@@ nt from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago has the end to the

the children &apos;s reservation is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously approved a law which is to offer this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 .
prior to this change in the sp@@ ouses there were several members of du@@ istic and mus@@ li@@ zed religious denom@@ inations on the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of various religious groups of the country , had gathered the state that the state should not be inserted there , because the state would not apply to maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ question@@ ing the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN children &apos;s Convention on Human Rights , defined by anyone under 18 years of age .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 percent there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statist@@ ical Office of the country confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were cont@@ est@@ ing laws to abol@@ ish laws followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support . no doubt they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , everything went handy .
a Hin@@ du @-@ Leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the criticism of the children &apos;s before they should take care of her own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition ass@@ ump@@ ed for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing and some doub@@ ts came to whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 must@@ ers ( including one woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , where there were already a simple majority to make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the trans@@ formers of the country gave a status update to Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill to the Child Labour was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and no one against it .
after having decided in the Senate in the Senate , the draft may now be made to the bill .
the majority of social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws have been changed before .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who clothed a minist@@ ration office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has plenty of time and un@@ necessary Ger@@ ede , which has devoured the core of the thing , but do you know what ? children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ happy that the day had finally arrived :
public Status Update to Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excellent News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , - 35 , - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ ds Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil group that says righ@@ tly openly about the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now ir@@ respective of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the proposed draft resolution was approved today , June 9 , 2017 .
the House of Represent@@ atives has 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and of which 35 were present at the voting .
all members of the members who were opposed to the law have approved the law .
the children &apos;s reservation is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ min@@ age@@ - child@@ birth .
many thanks to all the activists who have released him .
congratulations to you .
a Dan@@ ke to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
however , a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ hed@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ Organisation of the country .
before months , Mahar@@ aj announces his intention to establish judicial steps , should the law be approved , and it seems to be redeemed .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , meant that Mahar@@ aj was to go against the law , most social media users wanted to do the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
dear sat , if we want to go instead of the discussion , in a way that could only invite you to talk about the state in our bedrooms , that the state is that the state of our daughters would be mis@@ used , that they may be mis@@ used against them , would then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial control against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are in different gra@@ dations , or even the norm , even though there are laws that they are under@@ going .

on Sunday morning , the office of the Swiss news service Y@@ ar@@ News , announced that they were min@@ ced .
Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again through the mirrors on web@@ pages .
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , in terms of SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than one month , Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series defend against the pl@@ ywood .
although many techniques used to use websites are used to use tools for blocking sites ( an current article from the New York Times ) , that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world , most ordinary Wikipedia articles are not in this category .
although Turkey has been locked by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , has been taking place regularly block@@ ades of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it is about massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform continued to remain closed , several Mir@@ ror pages ( sides , which reflect the contents of Wikipedia , and often shall be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plan File System ) , when the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not make itself on the system of domain names and thus a complete Zen@@ or@@ ship will be difficult .
the content is un@@ locked in spite of the laws .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after having heard the messages ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to select snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this may help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they are not able to reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ os@@ a.@@ org page .
IP@@ FS also made aware that this stage was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and can only be used to screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to get the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ kan@@ ten@@ .org , an open source of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that anyone can use other Mir@@ ror pages when it is closed in the respective country .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and employee at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Days &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one gets to a different URL , which is not the original that you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server is running on the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are closed in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild photographer uses his camera to give attention to the need for nature conservation

so @-@ up was with the photos that he looked around it , never satisfied . they were scre@@ ed with po@@ or@@ ly positioned mot@@ ives and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him to bear a camera to bear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
he was still a child , back then .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ eth ende@@ av@@ oured to bring Nep@@ al@@ k to the international scene .
and his hom@@ ey place next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direc@@ ts the attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook as this superb location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I was reading right at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River was an Leopard .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I immediately ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to shoot pictures ! !
S@@ USS defines a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear how they look like .
and he should know it , because he had already stood face to face to face to face :
a tiger can not be anno@@ yed from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was because of darkness on the way to home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ grave appeared . he immediately sets us , we look forward to and he star@@ red by the s@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and there were mostly in a tent to make the Bar@@ dia National Park photos of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist .

half years after the wedding with Indian women in the first time , to discuss the names of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and was originally called on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released here as part of a content of content sharing .
in many parts of India we avoid women with the greatest care , to discuss the name of their hus@@ bands or even from older men in the family .
instead , they use a Pr@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
by Mahar@@ ast@@ ra to Mahar@@ ast@@ ar and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should disp@@ ense the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian State of O@@ E@@ a by a gar@@ rison and killed by their family and the village community after having addressed a secret called relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives are also not involved in the name , is also widespread among men . however , they have far from less assign@@ ments when at all , they should not follow these practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ dorf , in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ast@@ ra , nine women , among them health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus fast to the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone to discuss and discuss the host@@ ility of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
when one of 56 clubs , which are in 13 Indian states , is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ p@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and uses for the exploitation of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices , such as pedi@@ atri@@ rat to join HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously at amb@@ ass@@ adors inside the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini shown in her discussion round , tra@@ ded by women who did not call her hus@@ bands on the name .
she decided on this topic because she was able to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that could easily identify the women .
not to arrange the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they are guilty to all the demands and never have put in question .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition bear witness that she respec@@ ts her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep this , will be regarded as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never have made us up to this discussion round thought .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try her husband never before , at home , try out at home , as it runs out .
she showed the video of the discussions @-@ round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ mother and my husband still weigh long after the video was at an end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name .
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked any number of participants to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , off@@ ended , loving , aff@@ ection@@ ately and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means that they cannot respect us ?
should it be equal to it ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day that they brought up the name of her hus@@ bands concerning the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ast@@ ra over the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never be expressed in the name of her hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so sh@@ y that she just bowed down during the whole exercise . another decided to allow the entire infected fru@@ stration against him and his family exp@@ elled it .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine fr@@ enzy , with an ancient fires broke , the women decided that they would actually try to take home their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in his head : his wife could not cease to say his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ mother murdered them , she was afraid , and told that there was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said , &quot; I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tries to stop other practices , such as taking the interest in the red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the marriage status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the jo@@ inted red point if he would also open it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard it , that he might bear him .
the other women did not listen completely with it , but my , they are now in a better position to choose it , even in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can replace their views and goals .
&quot; we do a excursion with every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the box .
I don &apos;t want to take care of women who could hear what could hear , &quot; says she .
in the last months , they celebrated their own birthday celebrations in their lives for the first time in their lives . they d@@ anced and sang about things that they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have linked up some things , such as our ident@@ ities on our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ est@@ ly .
it feels great , certain things to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talk about the concept of honor , and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have taken care of only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of it is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ es@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a large shirt over a tro@@ users ; they have not settled .
after a great stri@@ fe and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes selection , the mor@@ als connected to Sar@@ is and much more , ug@@ g@@ ale Roh@@ ini is her own pair of cur@@ t@@ as ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to make it possible .
to the question whether you have changed slightly in the five months of its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into rolls :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they list@@ ened to say the name of her husband .
some , enclosed me , make it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women carry on at each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that changes they would like to reach in their lives - as the f@@ eil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or its own hang@@ ers - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
in making them self @-@ confidence , it will be aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman is in the club to house and others speak about what we &apos;re talking and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that probably made it recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had assumed attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hosp@@ ital@@ ized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State end@@ anger@@ ed ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Li@@ us Case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells it , he did not require it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China will still receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , who allow him to allow for a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely covered .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise printing around Li@@ u as a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions concerning Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian authorities decided to do nothing with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to come back to China , because exports have been mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the message has spread , that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee created his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to fet@@ ch his prize in Oslo .
because of his detention , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top graduate of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on the release of Li@@ us as she wrote in a statement on 30 June :
we expect at the same time that China lifts all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
you should meet all visits and receive you who want it and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad spoke to him that Americans have the possibility for the treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar as it was possible to help him in his gen@@ esis . &quot;
a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 , that the embassy would like to leave the Chinese authorities , not only free Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the withdrawal of U.S. embassy moved into a desert answer from China , with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to make a unique and imm@@ oral remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom , such as travel agencies and access to the medical provision of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in the congress to negoti@@ ate the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally release .
I challenge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditi@@ onally release to allow him to be in proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Li@@ u became &quot; all the medical support that he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
before reported diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had considerable concerns if the host could be able to refund Li@@ u the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for the right to provide reasonable medical care and give it the opportunity to re@@ produce themselves from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P before , that Li@@ u Ms. Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police still supervised the room in the hospital , and that it is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada challenged China to safegu@@ ard its international human rights issues , including free freedom , and to allow for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ur@@ ged China to allow humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures have to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments , which he needs , regardless where , required . furthermore , his wife and his family may contact him .
although the news broad@@ caster France Info already reported that the French government could welcome Li@@ u in the country , there was no further information that France will take it at the end of France .
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ lord of Taiwan called for China on 27 June to allow le@@ u free and require a larger tolerance towards those that require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development .
in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u has also called to allow China to allow the sick to be informed of intellec@@ tu@@ als li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed very wor@@ ried in a declaration on June 28 around Li@@ u , and gave heed to pray for Li@@ us Well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that he took the initiatives that he took and could lead to a harmon@@ ica , more stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , what might have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moving and encouraged , as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed the Charter 08 for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : town or Land ?
Singapore . Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may appear sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognised by an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore was considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the New York association of the New York Association , the ministers noted that many people critic@@ ised the predomin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compare Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ scores that Singapore should be considered the city .
... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , with most people going a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
in Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io , the Minister of Justice , accused the Justice of Justice , to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and promises to create this valuable land , we say that we would not be any country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the request of a flight to the responsibilities , a compulsory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of what , he appeared un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York as well as cities that are permanently led to a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er of the authorized representative will res@@ ur@@ ly come to the pen@@ gu@@ essing logic , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to its power .
in the final effect , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests in regards to our press , our studies of our studies , our political system really non @-@ answers .
related questions de@@ pu@@ te with non @-@ answers of rati@@ onal kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his opinion since she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so towards which country belongs our city ...
shortly , I understand not .
I would be very grat@@ eful when our value K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the efforts to clari@@ fy this point if he was paid up in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog its comment , he tells us that it should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , in order to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the publication .
as he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore said so un@@ easy , even if we are looking forward to free and righteous elections .
he is visiting Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw their decades a party ? ) .
as he said , Singapore was no land , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t know it in that sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an reveals his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes the leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I knew with Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that I expected to agree with them or not , but that is a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is true and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review The weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am Arg@@ um@@ ni :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; has committed an error &quot; or was it a m@@ ud@@ ger driver ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and so@@ vereign state ?
but when not , on which land go back the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the department of the government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
why are the people more expensive their military service , but they did not defend their country , but they do not defend their country ?
who has to pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink number of staff ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in , the Journey Journey of a Dec@@ ade regarding the asser@@ tion , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this pack seems to have many more people more expensive ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear about the defense of the country mainly &quot; etc . &quot; but this is not quite true .
we should speak rather from the defense of the town .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ers .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ erable aspect of your residence or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a consecutive row , with rum@@ ours revealed on certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et should be displayed .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is made by me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I am sorry , &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; I am coming from Canada . I have been living in Japan since 1994 .
depending on the situation in which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his talk time by adding personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication the standard answer is : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many c@@ ans are cooking in front of rage if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t inter@@ rupt .
for anyone who does not know it , there is little , which distingu@@ ishes us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans put a Canadian flag well visible on her back@@ pack when they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always married little monkey sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free healthcare !
there is no weapons with us !
gender marri@@ ages are already legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think of Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we often say very often . sorry . &quot;
Canada also is supp@@ os@@ edly considered the toler@@ ant country for ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends , which I wonder .
it would not account for me if one would change my example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; cute . &quot;
first , to be called &quot; cute , &quot; is basically to be careful - like the gut@@ ted , gentle , but trag@@ ically important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has a own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists in that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing on which one can hit .
harm@@ less his name is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that pass around one .
I even &apos;d go to say that the wish is , free and alone to be a major suppor@@ ter of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
as a &quot; cute &quot; figure , it is perhaps easy to cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we lack the warm @-@ heart@@ y , open kindness , which I now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; kind . &quot; our prime minister has done some sexy .
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that took the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert who seized power in 2014 and in spite of their way to restore civilian government , still gover@@ ns the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ ze Girl ) of the band tat@@ too describes a young man which tells of it that rules his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video refers to the continued military regime of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was blessed by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video charged was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; dict@@ ator was even blocked in Thailand , after a group of activ@@ ist activ@@ ates the public to view this video .
it is possible to interpre@@ t the video as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction to Thai policies , in particular as it holds to the country &apos;s position under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once these recordings of the video which relate to some of the political issues that have been pursued actively in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may potentially refer to the dra@@ stic Section 44 of the provisional Constitution which granted the commander of the host of an absolute decision on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; Settings &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are watched by the Jun@@ ta as a critic .
the image above reflects the introduction of the Act on Cyber@@ crime against , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often explo@@ ited by the authorities to conce@@ de activ@@ ist and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was established , supervised by the online content and persons having accused of having left the mon@@ archy having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand requires a stri@@ k@@ age against &quot; l@@ ese Maj@@ este &apos; ( Maj@@ ority ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a p@@ utsch of the army .
one of the problems that the j@@ unta remains pursued , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and the waste of tax v@@ eins .
in the video it &apos;s even shown how people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and users will viol@@ ate the mon@@ archy to their mon@@ archy .

the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ an@@ al indicate distinctive pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal pool of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Greeks , am@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area together .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the biggest Rus@@ sians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are mentioned in Asia Minor in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in this spirit .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ an@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population in the area of 16,000 people had hardly climbed over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ ai@@ kov@@ sky , symbo@@ lically situated for the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are ver@@ itable and quite rarely they will be inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls heavily to end this .
&quot; all is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning industry in the Soviet Union .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sh@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which is still one or two families , can be det@@ ectable in the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand , they draw away immediately .
&quot; our mother banned us that we let us photograph &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girls whis@@ per@@ ed something in her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly abandoned the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ an@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the substr@@ ate economy ( cultivation of land@@ sc@@ aff@@ ection products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to get about the laps .
in winter the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman went with name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ ger@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial aid from her daughter and in@@ sist@@ ed on that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente &apos;s monthly has just 9 dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a sweet garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she is too hard to survive .
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and enjoy holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we are visiting us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she is told her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; calls her a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; they said , We could build cour@@ get@@ tes .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as inter@@ party Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war started .
each day she re@@ members the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives that living in Central Russia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the Land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia simply dropped ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) recently .
we want to build a house there , but this will last a little thing , &quot; she explains it .
Nat@@ asha received approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband is working in the cab@@ bage ru@@ ster .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ in@@ as &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , h@@ äh@@ ne and chickens .
it tells us that it was a very anxi@@ ous situation when many people left the village .
but during the time they lost their fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has somewhat more to do with them .
after the war there were hardly work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our talk ten@@ ds to the end , a small boy was over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy from him .
he plays with the ball , which then roll up the hill .
a group of children is now scre@@ ened to the ball .
while they run , some of them cast a stone onto the waste ground .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which provide in@@ valuable in their lives .
they do not know any other way .

in Mexico it houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; Mig@@ rants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cks .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the PR@@ I.@@ org website and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ th year @-@ old Mexican female , a small woman with cor@@ als pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ eck and gold coloured earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy @-@ form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this sur@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they ) became a target for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on a transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , grinding , cr@@ um@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an immig@@ rants come here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s wife says the people in full little buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept inside cart@@ ons outside .
she desires to re@@ ject no pair .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medic@@ ations that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that hit the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
I asked if Mama Africa is a reasonable top name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ter ) pos@@ ing him with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cks .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women .
very aff@@ ection@@ ately .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to get there her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States usually to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had owned by other ban@@ kers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ kaner often travel the track and that the Afri@@ cans speak about the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his position leader , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance , and worked as a construction worker at the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
as the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana .
I ask him if he will contact him in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answers and will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests must send their times text message if they continue to gr@@ ate them or to report on the course of their journey .
they declared that Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but its guests have taught it , chicken , as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is very well @-@ known , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ est@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a cu@@ l @-@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rants from this winter .
it is a polic@@ eman and found that Bust@@ ers will be sold too expensive for African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking point outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; says he . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled out of the United States after a raid on his labour .
the majority of migrants who travels to Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents , also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he was fled with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to express his money without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a Un@@ known , one single one , has offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything full of guests .
in the courses , the trav@@ ellers were quiet their phones .
a small bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but she is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
how a proud grand@@ mother will show them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with afri@@ can hair care that you have made a sp@@ in , some photos of her grand@@ kids and many travelers more , kids and elderly .
they are sad , while she briefly presented them .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
check @-@ Point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from The Bike user .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority area in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the cell phone users received the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile phone @-@ notification in which they set up the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in communication , it is said that the app will be given access to terrorist information . &quot;
but the authorities approved the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , shortly after they had replaced the app .
in the notification of the police , the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terror@@ ists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , by online sc@@ am , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing @-@ pages to give attention to them how much time they would spend on online , and control the own home network .
this App with filters for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a versatile way .
for example , the remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker may able to manip@@ ulate or steal your home network &apos;s home network .
this introduction in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital Zen@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of user in major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , op@@ pressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme tough@@ ness and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet depreciation .
the media @-@ based media outlet for &quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( people ) , the cen@@ sored news in China released , showed photos by a Check@@ point where the polic@@ emen experienced the residents indi@@ scri@@ bed whether they had installed monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you &apos;re using a chec@@ kers with one device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
that is a form of captivity by the start @-@ up technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; image from &quot; China &quot; ( H@@ alls ) has also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can raise the password needs of a Windows OS , and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang could possibly be a reaction to the statements of the town council , to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when running their computer and communication equipment .
a current report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
on June 27 , in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities published their &quot; personal ID cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , portable hard drives , lap@@ tops and media cards &quot; by the local police .
the intention is obvious to identify any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy it . this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of potential exp@@ iry , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experience in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ o that you are quite alone in a place where everything has gone .
everything changed after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and dis@@ closed the truth , which is clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one who makes its name all honor .
a dedicated to a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you bring the reality back , and look behind the scenes - beyond the theater , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all the doub@@ ts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is moving on the axis of the evil . you &apos;re sure that you are here between the walls of your parents , who have built your parents here , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this did not have enough to form &quot; my Less@@ on , &quot; as the chief of the security instructor it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he set his power over us , knowing even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were killed during a peaceful protests like any herb from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to get the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ es .
all the city district cov@@ eted itself , just my own .
for the first time it was quiet , exc@@ el@@ essly , at the wrong time , even if I put no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state @-@ of @-@ organisms and their ac@@ complic@@ es .
in the third night the things were cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I underwent silence in that I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice caused by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt good enough to assemble .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we talked to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations and filled all .
at such a moment it will be aware that you fre@@ eing the Spirit from the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go - nothing can return your voice after you have led them all the way up to the office of security service from the body .
I joined there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men . my father was already there , as I did .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are just cour@@ age@@ ous to cry when we are not near . &quot;
its he@@ asser@@ ted eyes erected on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was fool@@ ishness to my fool@@ ishness ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I said : &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never stopped to see you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which such fat@@ eful consequences for me could , and I do not regre@@ t any word from what I said .
&quot; Fo@@ rests him in detail and his father equally with it . &quot;
&quot; his father was like with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this waste set is mine until today in the nose .
he became one of the syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was suspended for months .
I am a far@@ my@@ ard .
in the first office I leave everything that I carry with myself .
afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a course to the single cells .
I imagine all the details exactly before I care in the room .
different than anything else , they were assigned to a bigger cell in this time .
I have to share them with only one another prisoner , and may immediately stop me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I laid back on an old well @-@ established communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell was a &quot; adult det@@ ain@@ ee . &quot;
after a long time he was told me .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells , a respected husband &apos;s middle age who looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no experiences can be seen in me , and doctors do not have them here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe som@@ ebody , whose voice are similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers have an existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the major cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sures me , they would not spare , if I abide .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a bird of birds to drive all these c@@ rows that lab@@ s at the fruit in the garden of my head .
from afar , I still list@@ ened to &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cry is ir@@ re@@ ous , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black saw the color of destruction , until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the hor@@ ror by the person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; an@@ ew on the 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to listen to . &quot;
thus the secret was det@@ oxi@@ fied : in order to protect the State Security and to prevent the terror@@ ists of the terror@@ ists , they talk to us in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - so they played their counter@@ f@@ ite decision and deep@@ en the close field of view of its world view .
that is no house , which is not here is no land ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ ence to turn the crimin@@ als of their sound in a hero .
I supervised the hearing room and meet to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least it comes to me so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions that are still young , you &apos;re still young , you can join them to protest when you join this day@@ s. and to protest demonstrations to protest you soon . &quot;
I answered not .
I was acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer it , not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say more precisely when vou@@ chers and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation with me to become common communications equipment .
when and how it happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to be sor@@ row@@ ful if I had to be punished , though I had done nothing to make this punishment .
this is a penalty in all of its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much as possible from the body .
he calls the love &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , probably origin@@ ate from the clo@@ ak .
get your h@@ ug at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with it , and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my cri@@ es were not yet enough , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working earlier than gar@@ bage he@@ aters , or whether it belonged to normal working conditions .
they had four cables attached to each other to present themselves from their view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them will be changed , while still in the series .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I ceased to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling of the cooling , and found no pleasure in it . why he first took him as the next to an electrically charged rod .
current flow through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was thrown out on the ground , was the perfect guide .
the de@@ pl@@ ess disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two horri@@ ble hours , he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay myself again and let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ er . &quot;
I am answering the voice of one of the young people : &quot; my lord , my father , must make a fe@@ ar@@ ful wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and hold you , you will be re@@ located . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had been released .
where do they lead me ? !

Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b covers the majority of its time in@@ doors ; sometimes he shu@@ ffle his computer , sometimes to his computer , and also back to his couch .
but if one can depend on it , a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine fle@@ ece has to be discovered .
he lives in the chief of his family house that belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where it lived as fel@@ low@@ ye@@ en ( about : Farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who asked the conservative majority and asks their old tried opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression pro@@ clamation through art and Rap@@ id .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry . all these issues are not just found in its hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relev@@ ance , but also in cities that reach Damascus in Yemen by far as San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who is not restricted in its thinking by borders , and it can suffer according to his own statement with the people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though it is not open , he stim@@ ulates a special ascent against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war regions , anything like to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Po@@ vol@@ t@@ ant of the second generation , &quot; he himself referred to as well when he was born in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living things , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think that I &apos;m a man when he sh@@ ook the nest of Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in that time it is intended for Muslims to fast@@ en from sunrise until sun@@ down .
in addition , the Jord@@ anian law declared that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b revealed a certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions . on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ su@@ al hot j@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
in principle the s@@ so@@ res are lu@@ k@@ hot coffee and the wa@@ iti of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when one cast a look into the neighbouring countries .
hence , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water to drink , not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan had cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic State Front - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual acts of Ham@@ ed sen@@ o , the cultural and traditional standards of the country speaks and the main reason for the concert table was .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the owner .
many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that author@@ izes the most proven legitim@@ acy of the regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a raised the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; that continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural manifest@@ ations . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sh@@ immer@@ ing Rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact a clearly significant source of cryst@@ all@@ ine reality occurs in Jordan that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led traditional gender nor@@ ms to body by having ab@@ using his vision of Arabic women who pre@@ fecture sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a apparently well @-@ known woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should trust .
in the past few years , the number of honorary positions has risen to Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary affairs came to its peak in 2016 ; however , there is still lack of institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to assist in an appropriate manner .
according to a law on the frag@@ ile control of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of a danger of violence , &quot; and for their release is often un@@ bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will nothing happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music is pleased to announce great popularity and is known to dis@@ miss it in its country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is polit@@ ically , but he is thinking that he &apos;s his music that is full of explicitly on Sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , is not able to separate politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
to me , politics was declared , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question about the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is again on poverty .
the list of songs , which are polit@@ ically polit@@ ically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse @-@ story repeated itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is &quot; too . &quot;
in the further development of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get , in his words , &quot; that can , &quot; be faith or belief , heter@@ o or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that anyone speaks heavily in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were heavily cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , in order to realize that his comments were torn out of the context , pro@@ gres@@ sed and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arabic L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance speaks to homosexu@@ als not to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ an , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what was to work once in the task of the cali@@ ber , in the eighth century nobody could write about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ i do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against free expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher &apos;s teaching , with the reasons that they had expressed in social media critic@@ ising the problems linked to the deep deeply ro@@ oting corruption discovered by the country .
in view of what is the gig of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s opinion , only the tip of the iron - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ anian citizens .
for him is the progress of a permanent fo@@ e . Jordan has denied a stand for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - this is what H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - is made of slow , in@@ sider and in@@ sist@@ ence changes . it is certain that these changes are due to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , how millions of other Arab@@ s also , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dre@@ ad not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience . &quot;
perhaps the region will be affected by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental open@@ ness - and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ itions and artificial art . at least hopes it hopes it .
up to the end of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b becomes trans@@ duc@@ ed and therefore also resistance can aff@@ ord .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man is among student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant stro@@ kes are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that it is a version of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the Fest@@ ers , drums , and dancing more than one thousand years ago , were in the armies from the west Japan in the northeast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emig@@ rants .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a few amazing seats , so we got a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have a look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en after a long time . I &apos;ve just been seeing the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will take the only True - and to spend a breath of his sum@@ mers to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched me the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the observation of a 18 metre high tide was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were so important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime of crime and encourage a legitim@@ ate profession as to the Fr@@ iz@@ ur des .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us main port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drugs are daily .
in April 2017 , a survey published that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not be sure .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services .
the trend , visual appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ style of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to that more normal citizens can create , into the experienced hands of hair@@ style , which can im@@ itate these elabor@@ ate hair@@ style .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dresser , which go to the ou@@ ter@@ most borders of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , taking the competition of the hair@@ style &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric of L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos at current cont@@ ests is available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to replace their weapons against hair@@ dressing and instead of bad advice on education in hair@@ dresser , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated from this activity and the bi@@ kers opportunities have seen dozens of young people , that they can take a job at present in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the community and the district , where@@ of we are very proud , because we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa

use with kind permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; love For@@ bidden to gu@@ err@@ illa , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet a lot more important , people who feel out@@ breaks to show speaking aff@@ ection ?
this question went exactly this question from the two young Colom@@ bian activists . Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga von der Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , based on the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters on reconciliation ) , who encourage young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa p@@ ants letters .
just before short , their country was the field of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the Schl@@ us@@ point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the medi@@ ation of the peace agreement was considered as important that the president President José Manuel Santos offered for his mer@@ its in the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , in front of the Columbus , however , a long way until one can talk about an actual reconciliation and peace of peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock their guns now have to integrate them into life as a civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , which had used to life in constant anxi@@ ety and in some cases , has to record into their ranks , and support them into the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian showed that the young Columbus would close together and help the integration process .
and exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love @-@ messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illas , who then should be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
the idea for the reconciliation of the reconciliation was held at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the man we love to write on Day thousands of love letters , but those who forgot to need them much more need@@ ful .
he created he told us to share his love with people this year , who bre@@ athe in the most ur@@ gent in@@ quiries .
thus , the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now have to build their seats in society and have to establish a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make dis@@ course the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
up to now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is present in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive anyone &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students of the University J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the town council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ ists to store the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done earlier to meet the orders of their leader .
but this time they received no prec@@ epts but letters full @-@ saving of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from anxi@@ ety to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ ors of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province , described this unforgettable experience :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighter made me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ lor@@ ds &quot; ( a kind of refuge in which the gu@@ err@@ illas live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ atic , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go back because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Granat@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in the sleep sleep .
and I asked him , &quot; hello , what do they mean ? &quot; he said , &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless ep@@ ist@@ le .
never in my life I wrote something so beautiful , therefore I respond to it . &quot; then suddenly I got to tears about the che@@ eks .
I im@@ pover@@ ished him , and put me beside the Granat@@ werfer .
perhaps he was sorry for war , and was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be a shock at this writing , and would help to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never tried some other from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only possibility to retain him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a company outside there , who is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have just learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace rule , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
at the out@@ set , students and some of the F@@ ARC were assembled in a discussion round .
the students were up all up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
therefore , the Leader of the F@@ ARC declared the story of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help us to create a political party in this country .
for one goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people heard that never had found hearing and did not know that people who were often seen as monster , and even hate those who were often turned by their hab@@ itats and their environment , was very painful for me .
the truth , in which the land lives , does mine hurt .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who are killed , and so much damage can have caused us to give us a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote in the example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ vo , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the colum@@ n@@ ering has prophesied that after the de@@ formation of peace , it would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as it gives ine@@ quality , hunger , and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to attack weapons and to protest for their rights . and that &apos;s completely justified ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC now on peace to a policy without weapons .
therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of the race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to themselves - above all those that rise from a country in war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our post and sacrifice , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those of those who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ min@@ ent many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together .

it follows the translation of an article which was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ owa and its first publication on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ ian region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and compres@@ sors .
with hor@@ ror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months over the persecution of the persecution of Ch@@ echn@@ ya in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends like a re@@ cl@@ onal value of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q assembly , was not only produced by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and speaking with us what is currently in the Republic .
several months ago L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after reports were published , which que@@ fied the drag , torture and killing que@@ urs men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , suspected que@@ fied men , and caught up in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt a woman since her childhood , in fact she was a woman .
when they were grown up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so they moved to Moscow .
after a group had experienced a group of sex workers , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
she moved out of fear for her life in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
this was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ wife who captured in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I was trying to help her , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture from me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that these shame can fix these shame ? &quot;
after that , photos from my documents mar@@ ched through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just right there was a couple of shopping lovers from the back seat of my cars , I heard a mas@@ cot : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt somewhat in my body , but I did not hurt me .
then I heard a set but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you be able to honour the family , you wal@@ low ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and a@@ woke up the last end of the hospital .
apparently , some women had all of them and began to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances were you laid - in whom the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , since there is still my male name , but the doctor under@@ stand@@ still and laid me to the women .
therefore I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear , it was a Muslim name , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they call me , they wrote me - relatives , strangers , some perfect unknown .
that was the beginning of an alpha .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the requested to restore me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they found ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some said I must prove it by taking the streets above without the roads ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Gro@@ z@@ ny , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have a grain size C - what should I should say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only her family but dis@@ appointed the entire Republic .
we can not touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you need to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a snare to the neck .
than@@ k@@ fully , the neighbours therefore came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dar@@ kened window wheels and a licence plate with a 95 dr@@ auf .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends checked the number@@ ing plates that it was discovered that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I will not give their names , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something happened .
I still do not realize how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without brie@@ fing for me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I connected the SIM card to my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , if you have left the country ?
our people know already , in which hotel you are . they even know your room number .
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the sex bal@@ es , this is a tab@@ oo topic .
as a few traditional cas@@ cas@@ ian elements , I still carry myself in me .
so much I wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier , I cannot overcome it .
I say always that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
when we chat with the camera , I actually give me much effort to look like the person , that they look from their past - so is my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have d@@ row@@ ned ?
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who had inj@@ ected one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that Ram@@ adan was not arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will be on family and relatives .
thus , I call them , they probably invite you to see the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood Gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ g .
OC Media : are also now detained men in this secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of myself says that there weren &apos;t many many .
if , in particular , those that have no rich relations or left out of their relatives in order to put the Kad@@ y@@ rows of judgment .
as far as I know , they will be detained there , to present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they might attack any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radi@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is it just a g@@ rief or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just had to cancel someone at one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown to be@@ ard .
there has been nothing new to them since then .
they simply took them .
so , this so called Lord , this person was taken away when these people were taken .
however , until now they were not introduced as Band@@ its , yet there were no reports yet . we susp@@ ects that such actions are possible .
why would it not have been permitted to shave any of these people ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation had already been held in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always contributed my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I had lived there - and I never had problems .
Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; civil@@ ization &quot; but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows ap@@ sed ; I had coloured lashes , wore tubes and short tops .
the Ministry of Education of Sh@@ aria has never bent me a hair .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , mainly on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and all the city knew about it , knowing why men , young people met there .
we were never ins@@ ul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a spe@@ ech@@ at@@ thing : l@@ ush l@@ ad l@@ ad . that means : &quot; Sp@@ o@@ ats not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children if they &apos;re talking about sick people .
OC Media : so you simply have their eyes shut up before you because they believed that you are ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never have never fought , never ch@@ ased and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this grace be observed ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk on TV via Mor@@ al .
he didn &apos;t talk about us , but priority over the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change .
who was watching before , and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with suspic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic has grown steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m working as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I didn &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not too much in the USA .
apart from that , I still operate as activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I have communic@@ ating with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ ats , mer@@ ry , I buried them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I &apos;m not a p@@ enny for this .
I found these people myself when I &apos;m in@@ flu@@ ous .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ um@@ ber .
so is the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as the Cher@@ ry , who w@@ anting to make your foam fire before your mouth that there are no coils on them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have the Kab@@ ard@@ iner have also known the Rus@@ sians also ; but on all the planet there is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m coming from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims who go to the mosque and fast@@ ed together in the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know , many think about tran@@ sid@@ ental immun@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that men are changed to make more intimate experiences . but that is a h@@ clu@@ sion .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation , to be precise , different life settings .
it is the most important to feel me to feel me in my own skin and I am not ashamed of my body .
do not know if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I personally will be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad about that . I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n of an increase in self @-@ mor@@ ale within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arabian ancest@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment - and poverty within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ als .

the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 the desp@@ air situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child . he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxi@@ ety , depression and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to come up for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights groups who want to work and anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video made on YouTube made the moments after it had kindled himself .
some people made it fast to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide in August in the Arabian ancest@@ or @-@ minority interests , and activists from sit@@ u before that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights filed that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged .
their stories have one thing together : they were all family fathers that felt right due to persecution from the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to feed their families .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab Jam@@ w@@ az@@ i community live in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , causing the native Arab population to contest their living content .
in front of a century , Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took power to power in 1925 to termin@@ ate ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran next to the oil and gas fields as well as some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and unloading .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s system@@ ic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water of the Arab territories into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om have to be moved .
these tw@@ ins have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation devast@@ ated in the region , and the local agriculture as well as the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social Policy , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , completed in primary school , 55 % have completed a secondary school degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or @-@ human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , Global Vo@@ ices told that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment is yet worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancestors of Ah@@ wa@@ z newly registered ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in setting process :
since officials and institutions need to be set up Arab workers , the local Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will de@@ pri@@ ved the access to work facilities in all sectors .
that is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young Arab@@ s and to force them outside their hom@@ eland Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and so , since even Arabic name at work will not be toler@@ ated , sof@@ ar because the speaking of Arab language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation gets explosive .
it remains to wait if the world aw@@ akes and it does not take it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treated and su@@ ic@@ able is avoided .

&quot; why not I identified with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . this article was the object of several discussions where many different positions for expression came .
you can read in comments under the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , there are many women - especially white women who are characterized by themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
you wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even have well thought out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we would generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women or later lives in various fields of life on a gl@@ ar ceiling , and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it , and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I say on skin colour , on black c@@ is women , on black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , on black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I refer to what kind of physical and verb@@ al movement , there were many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but all of them all agree that women - all women should come together to take &quot; their voices , and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to attain the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a form of institu@@ tional@@ ized form ra@@ cial violence , which we are exposed to black women over two times .
or about that , black women and women earn less as a white men and women as well as women .
the black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are often referred to as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spin@@ h@@ ens and women with a migration background exposed to a higher risk are exposed to domestic violence and violence in the partnership as the white women .
on the other hand I want that all men , all men , and all men , neither have any skin colour the same rights . on the other hand , I can not connect to a black woman to take into account of the white woman , who ref@@ uses to take into consideration the gender as well as on the skin colour of one person .
I &apos;m in@@ exhau@@ sted and I will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere , which always rejected me and countless other black women .
he mour@@ ned in 1851 in their speech : &quot; am I no wife ? &quot; and I also refused me to maintain a ide@@ ology in the black woman in a historical aspect of a human and mar@@ g@@ inal being .
I ref@@ uted me to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb through cultural enrich@@ ment of our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ centr@@ alized program .
I won &apos;t try to increase white women to increase the importance of cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honour one better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was formed in order to give women from different approaches a home and dis@@ sem@@ inate from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I &apos;m putting it full , full and full of femin@@ ism and I join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , that is so persistent , that inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and give us to the hospitals that will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves to create our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , se@@ el@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately cried , after they have read these lines , I pray you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can raise bor@@ rowing women and women of other cultures , as I existed in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a field , in which my life doesn &apos;t survive , nor igno@@ red , still denied .
fighting the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that is in@@ explic@@ it about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article will once again be published here in the scope of Content War@@ aring Agreement .
always again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the last 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to deliber@@ ate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us its relationship with the influences of the region and the effect of contamination in his municipality .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fears that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , so@@ iling and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation of the Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance , to protect the rivers , streams , and water ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and published in Er@@ bil for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist , published in Er@@ bil .
the main focus of their work is followed , little noticeable sub@@ cultures and is characterised by the use of co@@ operative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed municipalities to tell their stories in their way .
Paraguay women and their more difficult fight against violence
one group women represents &quot; The crying women &quot; in order to express their pain on women mor@@ als in the country and in the region , and to show its re@@ jection .

the following article is the ab@@ brevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , reported about violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of affected people .
a police station A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez told us that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner , who had become violent opposed to her .
since the end of its relationship has passed some time and the police said , their statement would be laid to the actuators , but more could not be done .
another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was imp@@ acted because of mist@@ re@@ ation , also the exact review of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved back .
to break the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ is of violence against women is difficult .
when women attend all once , they do not receive support by the State in general .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men whom they mis@@ worked . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit violence to be victims of violence at all .
Inclu@@ ding impacts and Statist@@ ical In@@ struction 2 In@@ visible mist@@ re@@ ation and a legal system that nothing in@@ fer@@ ior 3 of the laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation of impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ ers on Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ Studio , a social scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not indicate the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; they are declared .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney got 9@@ 600 ads owing to domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came from women .
there were over 5,000 ads owing to domestic violence to peace . 86 % of advertis@@ ements were found here .
in ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only few of this criminal off@@ ences are actually shown indeed . &quot; on every woman who will be reim@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for psych@@ ic missions , 9 women who do not do this .
upon every woman , that is due to physical mist@@ re@@ ous display , two women who do not do this , stated at the end of 2014 .
since women in Paraguay had no own criminal off@@ ences , the prosec@@ uting authorities can not document adequate how many women will be murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman died because of violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn &apos;t take nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he in@@ sist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she was not actually wanted to do this , but then she was to regre@@ t it for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able :
I never thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read it before it , I always thought that the only woman happens to fall down , because they can be fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about mist@@ re@@ ation by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described its interests and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and related how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to invol@@ ve that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen so long by Carlos , and left him not earlier .
it seemed to be almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain fellow @-@ debt .
Victoria Santos , who is not found in Paraguay , fought in Paraguay with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner was har@@ assed .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can speak with others about their experience , listen to each other and support each other .
they do that what many other people do not do : they accept the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner managed to convince them to convince them that it was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads remained with the authorities without a result of their relatives and did not get support from their relatives .
it led a trial against its former partners , who developed to become a discre@@ et legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country where it mainly grew by money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws , which are very good but are not applied .
the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ors and a battle against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ik@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , provides great problems in the country &apos;s application .
on 10 August 2016 , in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ En@@ sure ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill can be seen before , Fem@@ ale has to explain the in@@ constant tigh@@ ten criminal off@@ ences , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia the case .
thus the legisl@@ ature was changed in some points to change the MPs for the Law , that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which currently banned in Paraguay , and can be pen@@ alised in Paraguay with up to five years imprisonment .
the bill was fore@@ seen to give the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process cost , which currently carry the victims of violence themselves even if they just want to retain and secure accommodation , to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri could be argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial funds for this :
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ation is seen as part of human relationships .
here a re@@ think is to take place , that violence is no longer regarded as a little bit .
those who keep silent in view of these facts is reflected and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ ual d@@ av@@ on@@ age .
we need to add such a long display until failure should not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously parts of the law had been modified , but among other things , a passage has been canc@@ eled , which had called up the partner in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was considered the opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
the cancellation of words &quot; sex &quot; , &quot; political power &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered great set@@ backs .
this article is the ab@@ brevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , reported about violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper continues attacks
&quot; this website has been closed due to the decision of the Minister of Information , to be read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the Cub@@ an authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n in the sult@@ an because of its coverage .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed in court , but were later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid who came to power since 1970 , after he had placed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , through a state of government .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Secretary of the Supreme Council , and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic freedom , including press freedom , limitations and def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ car@@ ving .
authorities , peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically , and advoc@@ ates citizens , also activists , their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions across both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper az@@ an , its closing and retro@@ actively three of her editors in the past year is a hard blow for the Press Freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its founding in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) , until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , had appeared in an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &apos; hands of the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary . in it was corruption in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high @-@ level civil servants in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having set up a judge of the Supreme Court of Oman , a judgment in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , Member of the Committee of Experts , was charged at the ISS before the special department and arrested for his arrival of security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS introduced the Deputy Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had licensed as Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed at any time after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on every way , including online , will be prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial was held in Mas@@ cat , the first trial of the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j have been sentenced to &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; mis@@ si@@ p@@ ation of the State of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violations of the Public@@ ation and Con@@ tractor of Public@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and sentenced to three years at the age of 3000 , a one @-@ year imprisonment against both journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after working on the use of a information system on the distribution of materials that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a security deposit was fixed in the amount of 5,000 USD ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of the judgment .
in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court pronounced Al @-@ Ab@@ ri sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dismissed on 10 April 2017 after the convic@@ tion of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is in prison , where he is sentenced to his imprisonment sentence .
in addition , the Court of Appeal adopted the decision of the Ministry of Information to conclu@@ de the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to re@@ locate Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks after attacks by the Ottoman government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the minister was again appe@@ aled against the decision of the Appeals Court .
the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only time in which Oman has been viol@@ ated the press freedom in Oman at most recent times .
for further injuries , for example , include the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression was still not willing to prepare an end to an extensive violations of the press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ conditional ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to re@@ prove their journalists in their work ;
3 . protect the Press Freedom in the Land and
4 . under all circumstances that human rights defence and journalists in Oman has det@@ ested their right human rights labour , and without fear of delay measures , including the judicial k@@ is@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organization dedicated to human rights ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and in neighbouring countries , supported by the promotion of Mein@@ l and Associ@@ ations .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia where he takes place with his in@@ compreh@@ ension .
medical research in Africa is only rare or even mentioned in the media . these are a growing area that addresses one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for taking medical research on @-@ site medical research . there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have become more serious than elsewhere in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by Phar@@ m@@ af@@ er@@ men are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research that is carried out by African scientists are carried out in construction of its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious consequences for the national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he found himself on the HIV virus before being decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ ic healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ understanding of media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors RW : at the moment on the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the major current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recipi@@ ent instead of having to be M@@ acher .
solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our area , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people that come back or come here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you had not before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interested , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there are requirements for special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , investigation of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientist in Africa over western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the read@@ ings access to scientific expertise that indicate challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible on payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited also the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine published by the solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been breeding sal@@ ads since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as outputs , the first plant cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been eaten .
for nearly 20 years , mort@@ ons work only became known only through its own obj@@ ection and the question as many sal@@ ads can be set .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not be able to bre@@ athe so far .
the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or gre@@ ton or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves .
over the last few years more such patents have applied to more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ ers and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of thousands of old tradition , M@@ orton still does require sal@@ ads , it is now longer , since its work is still greater than ever .
&quot; it is , when in a river , b@@ oul@@ ders should be a b@@ oul@@ der , around which I must move .
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents will go to Sal@@ ads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can bre@@ athe out some new sal@@ ads , because all the features have already been patented , &quot; it makes so good as possible and tries to find out those features that he would like .
however , however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use any material that is being protected as a spiritual property .
he is also connected to a movement that is always increasing in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS drew red tubes of the variety Out@@ red@@ ness in the greenhouse &quot; greenhouse &quot; the station , cultivated and eaten . there it will be tested if plants could be grown in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name is more so sounds , than that the movement from the IT area should come from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to in@@ spire the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched into life in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not being protected as a spiritual property , which can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , shortly Oss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eders can under@@ take that others can use the seed @-@ free from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to business and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders can only allow others to move it to their own varieties and are not immediately removed - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant accounts .
dozens of breeding and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ere prospects
Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i &apos;s Executive Board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , there is a role in larger cont@@ ex@@ ts such as biodi@@ versity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little to use , trying to breed seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ d@@ enburg is emphas@@ ised that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or genet@@ ically modified ones in the global agricultural industry . &quot; those who are offered good , locally and sustainable reproduc@@ ible vegetables , such as it is offered on farms in rural markets , should also know that the way is bred , that the species is far@@ med , threatened .
nutritional so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty without seed so@@ vereign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make other her seed remains free at hand . thus , its approach is to be patented by contrast , seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supports to ar@@ gue that the future of food provision is end@@ anger@@ ed because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous Intel@@ lec@@ tual Property Rights on plant material , which is thus un@@ conditional , un@@ ce@@ asing .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with the genetic variation of carrots and their availability . she found that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ els are protected as a spiritual property , making it possible for plant bre@@ eders either not or can be used for plant bre@@ eders .
there are no estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by avo@@ ids that mass@@ acres of wheat as wheat in even larger style patented as a salad or car@@ rot .
a Question of Vis@@ iting
plants are cultivated so cultivated that they provide specifically developed attributes - such as their taste or their color enh@@ ances until such as th@@ ri@@ ve in certain environments and thre@@ ats as p@@ ests or diseases .
ad@@ versaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , since the changing conditions are un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ en activities . with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture , the United States set up the company for the maintenance of genetic diversity .
they contra@@ dic@@ ts the view that intellectual property can promote other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties of innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan which can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ res .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
therefore , such protection in@@ hib@@ its innovations not , but promotes them to provide the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
M@@ orton looks quite different : for 20 years , until a patent expi@@ res , make sure no innovations .
and if they are waiting for a long time waiting for plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle .
the main argument of M@@ orton , however , is that genetic resources always have been a general practition@@ er and it continues to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ous incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
that is what drives us , and it is impossible to us , if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
in total , M@@ orton stim@@ ulates the concept of plant features : &quot; we have not designed the features really .
they form themselves , and as bre@@ eders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eders in the US state of Oregon and Oss@@ i , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeding a variety , also breeding its own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their growing custom her@@ b@@ icides are needed , breeding in his s@@ orts of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very contrary . &quot;
while a few medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are in international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , make it the most smaller seed companies , even without patents , either re@@ ject it , or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ mun@@ eration or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank M@@ orton looks for breeding in his breeding garden Sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eders could be more innovative : &quot; it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new products , more than the company that patented .
I need a new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my s@@ orts in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you are protected from the competition for 20 years . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads very quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in resources , an &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding program works in the centre with farmers together and helps them to identify new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports you to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding are different from country to land , in due to Oss@@ i &apos;s commitment , the Oss@@ i obligation can not simply be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission explains that conventional cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the present practice of the European Patent Office which permits the patents of conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now part of the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office for this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , based farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source , seed and seed companies , and the global trend for god@@ entation of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for h@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed sales systems that the organization is currently a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed production systems which will be scheduled to fall next year of the official start of the year .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database to seed and biodi@@ versity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed in seed .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a group of aid organisations like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to bring out seed and to improve seed policies , thus ensuring a stable supply of food products .
in the report also the importance of a varied , local utilities with seed for sustainable food systems under@@ lines - a connection to the Lu@@ by of Oss@@ i , hop@@ ing to recognize him soon more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is especially counted , where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to clear the people , that even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities contents on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government locked the website of the H@@ Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp@@ ly and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information continued in spite of this attack , and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution in the Arab world . even though it was never so difficult to overcome these goals , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirmed that all technical possibilities would be exhau@@ sted to overcome and do not un@@ lock . we hope to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first licensed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after authorities started more than two months 21 web pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaze@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

apart from AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights ab@@ uses Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog to spreading column and articles which he writes in Egypt not accessible web sites and media .
now , the blog which he set up in order to avoid the C@@ ens@@ ur@@ ce of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of the D@@ ada blog is native , however is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being reported by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the students prot@@ ested and took a video , as the police experienced physical violence against two students .
his article turn primarily by politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a fac@@ ebook review , Zi@@ ada expressed a pl@@ uck by the government and refle@@ cting what this means for him :
the , blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blo@@ om of blo@@ gs may not meaning@@ fully for the world , it is now for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is managed to mediate to me the feeling of a siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons to the national Security Council , re@@ jection blo@@ gs , as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even though only a small audience .
I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I took it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now after having blocked him , and that they may have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the b@@ old go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) un@@ locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages . this provided technical testing in the network of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the pl@@ etion of providers that was possible by Internet Security Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) as Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th we realized like the re@@ jection of websites that offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
such a specific practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents and to fil@@ tering the Egyptian user may have access to the Egyptian user .
the situation is also lim@@ it@@ ated , that the decision makers must be closed behind closed doors , which the Egyptian population does not have legal basis , with the help of the crimes against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it as next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

some of these head@@ lines are as follows :

in the middle of the economic crisis and in an an@@ donated financial situation , the force of force in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called to be able to access the United Nations .
reports like these are all@@ acceptable and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the managers of a local newspaper .
in this way , the report published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on the 16th of August is not normal , &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes reported in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual off@@ ences , etc . everything that however , however , will be published in Rio &quot; section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative in order to close as journalists in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of Chief Editor , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist , in the newspaper , explains that according to information forwarded by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course if it is dist@@ orted so that , as it can be used , atro@@ cities of the police who only sho@@ ots and then asked questions to do .
but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and their partners .
does the designation &quot; War &quot; more than it profit ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed that violence as &quot; war &quot; has argu@@ ed . this is their opinion in a just@@ ification of failed security policy by the media and could be worse , responsible for calcul@@ ating the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in staff , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historic and sel@@ f@@ ancy neg@@ le@@ ct of public service .
reminder : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; to mark the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the mor@@ nings per state , Rio is on place 16 , &quot; she writes .
in addition to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , is emphas@@ ised , in addition to Cec@@ í@@ lia , the State Policy of State &apos;s security policy has been repeated for years .
to these un@@ certainty measures , the establishment of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ ver@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ ce An@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Great Depression , whose goal is to conquer the goal of a massive police building a Fav@@ ela and to be station@@ ed permanently .
at first this led to a decline of violent deaths . for some years , U@@ PP was supposed to protect the U@@ PP after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities , who would need to protect the curious police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explained why the Viol@@ ence in Rio did not comply with the defined criteria defined by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio has also a serious consequences for mankind .
for this calls for the state to use means and ways , which are typical for war . this includes the penet@@ rating in the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and to object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ aging balls . &quot;
war to or out , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ el@@ as will continue to be in Rio .

in order to stay alive : besieged Syrian , mushrooms ,

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and the Sur@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
especially strongly affected is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations , and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigation of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that caused the Assad regime .
since 2013 , they have stood controlled areas outside of Damascus in the siege of Damascus , which led to that residents were ordered or under@@ ed food by tun@@ nels and control points .
due to the years of block@@ age , traditional food products such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics are the inhabitants of the East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms don &apos;t belong to common , in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , she makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the project , subscription Nab@@ il , said to the French News Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to flesh , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project was unknown , and pressed his relief that it now wins more and more &quot; to a friend . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ most since the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .

on 21 October , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal and claimed justice for the victims of fires that took place in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died and approximately 70 injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for a period of 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that were spread out in northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and many villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande in June , where fires are 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Fore@@ stry management system , which the forest areas are monitored by satellite recordings , in 2017 there are approximately 500,000 acres of forest in Portugal - an area of the size of Lisbon district .

the goal of the protests in Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .

João So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of the farmers from Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing evacu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did so no@@ where : there are dozens of open parts of open roads which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again in June , since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in furn@@ aces with a high school of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko are asking .
an advanced suggest@@ ion to the Wal@@ loon form , which brought the government after serious fires between 2003 and 2005 , was founded by commun@@ ists , which saw the new rules as obst@@ acle for investment .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity of the case , if the applicant could have a means of self @-@ protection , so it was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; performs the Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the Quer@@ cus organisation set attention to attention that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made of slightly burning wood , like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ im@@ is , after fires of this species always wider .
to these problems comes the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents were seeking or attempted to contact them offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : you used the own civil data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the site and spread of the fires .
the project was called by the developers of João P@@ ina in 2015 to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers have followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400,000 users who followed the fires , the site counted more than half a million .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , Afghanistan &apos;s conquest began through the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group had broken out which survived the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i in central Afghan in the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not say then , she knew that she could not see her son much longer - perhaps even more .
the boy had to break in the morning .
his un@@ cle would bring him back , and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just assassin@@ ated by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly protection .
the Taliban fighters known for their hat@@ red on Haz@@ ara &apos;s Taliban were ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara fors@@ ook the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked in a coh@@ er@@ ship for a few years . the work was difficult and made it sick .
then he took the thing that was left out of its low wages and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and stopped sacks with mort@@ ars , heavier than he himself , in order to make his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
at that time , life Afghan refugees fell by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , remin@@ ded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site at which we worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we suspended nylon before the open window , so that we did not tum@@ ult at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
the dangerous crossing on the sea suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af &apos;s homeless , went alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that divided twice the day of Essen in need of aid .
it is true that Italy remains a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers thanks to relatively high levels of asylum seek@@ ers . however , it &apos;s true that the terms and conditions apply to asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ t@@ Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; they are impro@@ vised by impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ skilled personnel and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center if they have formally applied for asylum - which can still be applied for months after the registration of asylum .
until then , people who have no money for a accommodation , either to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road .
so also A@@ shar@@ af also came .
but his un@@ distur@@ bing lifetime helped A@@ shar@@ af to free from these conditions .
after having made several years in construction in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af finished his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
it was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while still a time .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the &quot; handic@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
many of them is the country a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in the last few years some of Afghanistan operated companies , including cutting edge , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some of Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for her excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of its restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ it@@ ress and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells you through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts to the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ k targets are rich , however , far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ y industries and the retail , and went back to the country that he had to forced to forced it as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af is also plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; thus they can sell their seri@@ al@@ ese people on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubt but at the end stand stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey himself . now he would also want to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
