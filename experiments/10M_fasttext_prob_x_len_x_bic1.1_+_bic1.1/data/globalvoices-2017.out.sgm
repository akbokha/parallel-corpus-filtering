<seg id="1">Although I had visited the United States at least once a year since 2012, I would now live for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American films, I read American music, American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a massive impact on me that I was mainly because of a US film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14 years old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Gartham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who was covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-Student, the Supreme Court of the judges who had scattered his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it as if that the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I was living in Arizona, my admiration had been reinforced for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so delightful that you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very funny letter of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the hostility and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me as he is surrounded with its narrow face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops with his mind, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he think, as a former colleague told it, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerica and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet people responded to his statements and approved in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support this bigprix person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get trump and his electorate in harmony with the people that I had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journal, invited people from all over the world, a deeply smoothing human being, with whom I managed to maintain Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, Trumps also voted in line with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in order to look at the Phoenix Suns.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family that I treated like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with a lot of patience and suffering from my colleagues to get accustomed to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them penetrated my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they bring me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite or maybe because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggles with the idea that people voted for trump, because they distributed either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to oversight these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to draw the Trump-electors as a cassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates a ability to understand the ones that act and think of a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes are not taken into account in their municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters are supposed to have voted for trump, because they would like to gain control over a country that has disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps too.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget David Remnick's words, who sees the cruel decision to raise a man with regard to those who look down differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm. OB): as much as "Rejection of White against all other Ethnias"; word game from white in attacks on the White and whiplash, what is the great Van Jones called as it did so great to America so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Million people around the world estimate the American Ideal - whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have, America is definitely welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his presidents, twice the son of an Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, anywhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice Donald Trumps, however, there's a huge part of white America's promise and says: to Hell with Throughness, Religious freedom and all the term of Pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the resting place, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">Donald Trump, could my son, Captain Humayun Kahn took a place in your Americas? "ask Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brushed the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they responded.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your Americas? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone, who doesn't like to have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a voting and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God be thanked, Mr. Trump, isn't this America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no more place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero church in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayaean town Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places does not only have the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby medieval ruins and world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La Banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) has now been playing in the community: one from children and an adult existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school of 100 students is become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs-abuse and the band violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth had ever built a rare hopes.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take away their obligations towards the musical group, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI comments:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to attend their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always arrive awning and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpanos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music made of rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero is playing the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion, on the instruments which are made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments made of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop of musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler started to turn into instruments under the baton of Favio ChÃ¡vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitated covings, violas, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trombones, trombones and percussion, all from the garbage were manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, of Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez is reminiscent of a local economist and musician from the children of Cateura, at the beginning of time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and had to teach in the same place, the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin was made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a complete orchestras that are made in instruments made of recycled material and calls itself The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary Names "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live from him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they will transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of litter music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork successfully fight the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing was fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that uses targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs in the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to joint use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">At that time in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before leaving the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were displaced and inclined to be a little of the law from this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself against the ship. they refused to appoint one of its harbours and refused to share a fishing treasure.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that refused to remove everything", "the Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenan Fisheries Agency. it is part of a team that discovered the ship's ship and persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it wasn't possible to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay $2 million to Liberia for pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects particular practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven out the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charger Trusts Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, causing it extremely difficult to play. thus, the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate contempt of existing laws, by means of certain habitats and species, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delikate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions against illegal fishing, the bureaucratic hurdles were interfered and also caused by the snow deprio, so the actions nowadays in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange including lists of existing licenses, news, to suspects or more details, considering or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even very attentive when they move on open sea with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that fishing in forbidden areas - about such that point to suggest that a ship will load his caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the idealcase, such investigations show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing catch, can refuse to accept such ships in their harbors, meaning that the ships can not sell their cargo. and that they even could be forced to pay the numbers of penalties, as in case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a reunion company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported by FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A completed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $20 million to lost sales, and lose the eight members of the network HISH-i any year because of the illegal fishermen that penetrating Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fish stocks, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also, lower illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among others, other promotions are among others like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying phasia seeds, fishings protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale hole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been uncovered in criminal networks, who discovered counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several deceitful identities and has found volatile ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the International Food Safety Authority, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies show us quite well into the networks of organized crime "," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is to help FISH-i to localize ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's Wi-Fi system, which is always developed, helps to hide the illegal vessels, like to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the Illegal fishermen use very ingenious techniques to conceal their activities and to hide their position. "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst of Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be loaded from satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines various types of information. FISH-i will help you to find criminal ships with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch for the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" to gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who makes what's doing - that's just sense, "says he." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system allows persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but they also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that exploited fences-exploited and hardly with consequences did know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i involved a 33% increase in fisheries products, since then fishing boats are able to purchase more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 opened up doors, had the inspectors there on board towing nets, whose application is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries make these successes. "" the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries joined together in 2015, for so-called west Africa Task Force. also, they fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "" With security, the goal is to bring more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country passed its first major triumph in October: in October, Greko 1, a ship which was travelling under false flag. and not only the ship was operated without a license and were not allowed to have towing.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also reserved in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the start of dimensional rules against Greko 1 it set a strong signs that they go against illegal fishing catch, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, evidence is such a particular, collaborative work style to protect the oceans in the entire world ocean. Emma Bryce recreated professional journalism and lives in London. there she is subject to the environment, technology and nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="152">Her article will appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and The Guardian. situation in Venezuela is going forward to: demonstrations in several cities with the aim to get "the land"</seg>
<seg id="153">The trams in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of strong demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a now grown man, Quijano said in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were committed to crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought out his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the citizens, the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">At that time, I believed that was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a feeling.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, you don't notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I was not able to know that my father was a thief, folks and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarimercian. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="220">You are a dickhead, you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass just that they may not escape a day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Turcionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the gym. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would become a mear.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be OK. for so my Father had stripped me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degree, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, prowaiamaterial, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'there the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father gave me a total of four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to ascend. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - simply all possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little in a blanket for me and ordered to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of Baracke, where the stolen objects were arisen and kept myself with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open room and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I paralysed in and saw a couch for tortured on men.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looks like a waterbed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that she fortified the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been frozen.</seg>
<seg id="241">They binds a man with handcuffs along the bed, overflowed him with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stank there was horrible... like a dirty windy.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body in need is.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much sorrow?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were stacked with handcuffs and to bind them.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people were bound with the face down - all were bound at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance, people still swim in the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father saw that I saw at the captives, he said, "What do you look like?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I met? why did you bring me back? "</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit, and killed by soldiers, and was buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this, because my father told you at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La Cuadra there were several rooms that were referred to as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero turned out there a man and killed there.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to the survivors of civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla Ribera process, was also indicted by the students RaÃºl Mateo Molina to death).</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video, Emilio Fessia, the director of the La Perla memorial, leads through the former paperclips.</seg>
<seg id="262">The way, where you came in here, is the way that we arrived here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you look at the map, see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here they were changed their names and were assigned a number assigned to the process of deformation.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the order from above came that they should be transferred.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was a lie - the Euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'warspoils'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all the possible stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "warspoils" - as they called it.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the Gendarmerie - it was clear to me that the spoils had a bayonet or maybe military number, which one has fought against an enemy that is fought against him.</seg>

<seg id="273">But when you enter into a house and to the refrigerator, record players, clothes, paintings, money..., then there is no war, but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked me how my father, the head of security forces, could do with this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also officer in the Gendarmerie and I never would like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my Father could do it.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I said, "You who clothe cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded him, struck me, and he cried out:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and bring you back.</seg>
<seg id="283">But let's need to know others!</seg>
<seg id="284">That was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no single memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of at that time, on which I put on a jacket and snail sweater of wool. both I had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still produced clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time accuser accused me of having to have been a pity on this crime. I said, no problem, they can put to me a burden, what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was anyway there to speak.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the dead is the last abhable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now I know where I am older, I'm Reue.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. once only children have children, recognize the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">It is developing and recognizes that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went much to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you did excuse during the dictatorship of the dictatorship. but to why the bodies let disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children are kidnapped?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with her home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">Again I turned the question again: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could not have been able to bring them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess, it was simply decided to kill these people. but to why make their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families who could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the dead is the last abhable act which can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was reintroduced to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and somewhere where - no idea, where. "one will never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything else remains forever.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i have seen how you have killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to declare it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was with the Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea of trying my father was there during a conversation when he stood under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made an accusations because of all of the atrocities which I had to experience because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he said, "I don't know. I have no one put to death."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt internally displaced and asked me why all patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which they allegedly defended, were actually good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried out:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell what to tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you have killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you are forced to take part in a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only said: well, I will show me. "</seg>
<seg id="320">Exactly that did I.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I saw the first advertisement.</seg>

<seg id="329">The term "Megacausa" refers to the magnitude of the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="330">After four years in which more than 581 witnesses were witnesses, the historic La Perla Ribera Process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 716 victims finally in August.</seg>
<seg id="331">43 Suppressions were found guilty of crimes against humanity and in 28 cases, the court was sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases, and in nine cases, there were acquittal in six cases.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers from a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence in the last month of witnesses of a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">In a shield, the Japanese word (comegen sha), the "older drivers" means, probably, but maybe even with evil backlocks & # 8212; as a "feeditable driver."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was on display in an electronic view from the 1st to 20th September at the entrance and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was impeded by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware that the local newspapers made sure.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an appreciation for elderly people and in an international town like Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes" said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was first removed. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture refers to the translation errors. she explained that the error was already contained in the text which it was checked by the translator and that the translation was not checked before it was published before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told me about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"it's sorry that elderly people felt by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast news put a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "awesome" older drivers in Japan, saying:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was offended as an unreasonable description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents, but is quite anxious for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto region, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a percentage of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens filed 1.803 from a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of people caused by senior citizens increased in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The well-mentioned reporter gathered in the article published in the article comments of Article Comments on the Light, which show the preliminary parts of a Japanese apparently against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo via the translation errors received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is it not the reality?" isn't it the reality? "</seg>
<seg id="369">- "How bad is the translation not actually, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that this is a real translation mistake."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two major skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and knowledge the language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active rule of target language - something that is in the case of motherboards. generally, the conviction is that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - motherboards.</seg>
<seg id="379">This is why a French native language should translate from English to French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no employees in English as a mother tongue, which might have translations into English. this may definitely be lacking for the transfer, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can be attributed to Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees do have their work internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is the best thought to be translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automatic translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The distilled and avenging sentences which are created by automatic translations, show that this technology can still replace a human translator. this applies to some languages altogether.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English Forbraids in Japan, among them also the encapsulated essprints, often used t-shirts or bags, will be used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like wax still acceptable or at least harmless. but of large enterprises, or from the government that have funds to ensure greater standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto has hopefully use a serious source of their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censing measures on the Internet and TV</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto PRENSA y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet user demanded that they have no access to the Online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet array of VPITV and El Capitolio TV could not be accessible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="394">Another online-transmitter support recordings of the protests in Caracas, organised by oppositional groups that resisted the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the task of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is chewed, and receiving the user, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay with internet access is popular primarily in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been counting on the coverage of protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened with monetary policy and lockers when the Commission would continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "calling for Violence."</seg>

<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is even cheaper than two litres of limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsine filintro confirmed that it is not only accessible via Vivoplay through a pletion of domain name System (DNS) but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly continues its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier reresearches of the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that local Internet providers are using DNS via a technique which answer the DNS server on certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a Internet is blocking by DNS, the server responds incorrect or denied the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS release: @ elaboliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third-locked channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV-Camera was Elvis Flores, who was transmitted live in Caracas on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was arrested in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV resumed on show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government is regulated by Internet connections: thereby, the Venzolanians support access to multi-media coverage over the current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay many girls will become a slave to get a training</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a son of Criadita. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina for the rights of children and collects witness testimonies of other Criaditas, which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo of Cecilia Rojas. use with friendly permission from Kurham.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the slightly shortened version of a Short news report, which will be published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen," ("Feasine Cessay Schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where they were not together with the family, who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from the University she once again returned to the house, and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">The thing that has become something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated as a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as Criadita to work for the family. as Criaditas, they referred to Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a family with little money transfer their minating son or her minded daughter to another rich family. in exchange the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned, is that the children have to pay countless days of housework which shall never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not raise up in the framework of a contract that cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">In Paraguay, this is known as Criadazgo, in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous human rights organisations use wide.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crime - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness statements, calculated and prancian.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the Criaditas, generally guarantees a standstill in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," Alvarenga explains.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is also the family, who decided to close their daughter in the faith that she will improve their position in society, and can make something out of itself, in which there is a different family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand stands the family, who justifies the girl with the faith and justifies that someone would give you a chance that would never get any training and might even be hungry.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is harassed, his family will be experienced after many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they even experienced it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in paraguayan households, has got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n in CaaguazÃº was hospitalized, her body showed traces of strong strokes. shortly after this she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the budget of the former military national TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016 Ferreira was defeated by a stick on MarÃ­n until they suffered a deadly injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They were concrete in mind that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted in the Paraguayan Society of Criadazgo responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They designated the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there will be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">In Paraguay, more cows are registered as children, "Tina Alvarenga complains.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without Papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of a couple and almost 60 civil society groups demanded an immense investigation on the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They wish that TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case is before the Court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n may be landmark - for the first time in the history of Paraguay an example of Criadazgo is coming.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">Criaditas are not only exploited as working forces, they are also isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, was able to register and lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that you still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">It rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, they purified the fridge, clean the living room, polished the furniture, and the infected floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because she had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says that she was never hungry, but got not a limited meal. "I was allowed to take more books from the library of the householder as food from the refrigerator," remember them.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the owner, a former military and sympathizers from the Partido Liberal, a Liberal Party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="473">Her Lord feared that she would lose the formation of her, she may lose her.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was however completely clear that she had received her hard work for everything she had paid for them.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga discriminates. "a matter of which almost never spoke, are mobbing and the chicans who are exposed to school when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children of parents may know them immediately, anyone who has no parents, is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was unable to charge my home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary parliamentary debate has recently approved a bill to "the regulate concerning the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When he is accepted by Parliament, user workers have to register their social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law then a place will be set up, which is to be asked, citizens and citizens provide a permit to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law you would have to register their users on the site of the site with their correct name and number of staff numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine of fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as an "jedwede application which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others using voice, video recording and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set to pass, since the draft is passed, as the draft stipulates that they are able to register their users who are unable to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee the regulation on stage of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Swiar, Parliament, Member of the Legislative Decree, reported Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to come by the firewall to come across the firewall.</seg>
<seg id="510">That could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those things, it would be necessary to submit to the Egyptians for Egyptians, to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not so far known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the lecturer.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Institute (in German "Leader") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I have strongly committed to the technical capacities and the understanding of the neither department in Egypt according to things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">According to my opinion, they stand as well as it could also be done for raining physical public and private rooms can also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, then it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to prevent citizens necessary, or not. and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of human beings, and to bring it to a trial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be approved as a law, the draft must first be discussed under the legislative elections and the constitutional changes before it enters the debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his assumption and termination is successful, or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military think of parliament, in whose sense the control is expected and ensured that no different scoring on the image surface is present" says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the parliamentary stock of Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber criminality in which a life imprisonment for those intended to threaten "public order to threaten" and "to protest" to protest. "</seg>

<seg id="525">High above the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq work the animal protective Hana Ahmed Raza, and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Walks to protect the spiritual Leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">There is a subtype of the larger family of Leopards, which are matured by Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are found due to Wilderei, loss and fragment of their living space, as they always endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian king is the only remaining predatory of the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and thrives of the ecosystem also depends on that a large predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video it shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza is pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">When educated Biologin shows Raza passionate and other side of their country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">Since six years, it has been involved in field studies to wild animals and on education programs of nature.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the progress has been documented for the northeast Japan, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shenno Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a prefect in Japan. the earthquake and the resulting tsunami had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to vanish because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even so, the Fukushima prefecture even experienced a nuclear accident, so that's why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shenno indicates that progress has been reached after six years, in order to rebuild the life of the local town.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing facility in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shenno Newspaper is reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (pits, saigai kouei, juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi could see the biggest success under the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima joined the closing light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">He still endeavoured to settle in final replacement houses six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from accommodation (people, casetsu Juutaku) in the final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such rooms.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the year 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in Notwithal. more than 75 percent of the evacuated, which were earned after the disaster in accommodation packaging, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of the work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shenno Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by misfortune, their doors opened up until December 2016, which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">Whereas almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are once again into operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have moved large-scale construction in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural surfaces, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and fewer than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a consequence of nuclear failure is, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares, destroyed farmland of Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear warzone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism essentially recovered again, but Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same stand as in the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, this is only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shenno Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is difficult to earn their living content.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine the overall impression, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuated people. she asked them about the status of the building and also how their indignation has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shenno introduced a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the resident population, measures taken in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents have not yet done enough in catastrophes health prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shenno Newspaper has also been reinforced their attention to the location of the evacuated area of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima, had also been a witness of the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear inlet, in Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people from Fukushima were moved to areas outside the prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, which had been resettled in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated areas, most of the evacuations are going to be more than 50 years old. they are to be replied with massive building projects, because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games 2020, which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences may first be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while it is often noticeable that more than it seems to be at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they call out our preferences to expand our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat topics that have often received less attention in coverage than they earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember at a moment if they have felt very strong with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Torch Egheri explains how the love for music has devoured your lack of common language during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias speaks about the time where she has collected with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva is on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 brought this week into the intensive care unit: last Friday brought him a police officer during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia, with a protest against the head. nationwide rose million of protesters to a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull of brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him this Saturday and now translated him into a artificial compass.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critically.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local Image journalist Luiz da Luz did photos from the attack on Mateus that rapidly spread to Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, which was identified with a stroke attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the completion of the investigation into the incident of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, as he proposes in GoiÃ¢nia with his impact on the face of the Meus Ferreira's face (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would be beaten by demonstrators and on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, distributed by Luiz da Luz, sent a video on the net, where you can see how Mateus is attacked by police officers and several sanitation shortly after it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video featuring the same scenes, but from a different perspective, is also dipped into social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the below shown clip one can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th of second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state of State, Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazilians Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover one part of the costs for medical treatment and to remain in the hospital in GoiÃ¢nia while living in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls further nonviolence against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme joined Irish from his father because he had attacked the Occupy movement in secondary schools, and here was a occupied school of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen, having beaten him on his face by a policemen.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police overlays</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived at demonstrators on the last Friday in the past Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen set up a stage in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had prepared a stage for speakers, rubber migratory and lacrives.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputies Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), implored the police on violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">It is also a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media traffic protested by taking the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folllas de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported well over a crush glass window to fit together with a photo of their cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O globalo preferred a title story with a burned bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about one broken window disc than the Protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also recognise this if a strict against any form of affairs is damaged.</seg>
<seg id="624">Also here the term "Vandalism" is an absurd, disproportionate significance, and the typical powers of the military police are backed by headlines with the title "demonstrators on a confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Die of The Abindustruts forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar pipes implemented in all Cuba the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The commune of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±ali, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of what there is no significant sugar content on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar pipe factories were laid out.</seg>
<seg id="629">After developing the sugar pipe industry in the region, the factory lost gradually after its plants, until just the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some change the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commutes daily to factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldier veteran, open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar pipe industry do not smoke its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in the east of the region of sugar cane factories, which are again in operation after long inactive time, because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something, what he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds of exactly that in MaÃ±ali the sugar tube factory would be obtained, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar pipe industry violates the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for some decades before a reason for the land, but the poor harvest of the poor are no more entirety.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the village saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar pipe industry was an economic need: the 155 sugar pipe factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive, they were not portable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which sugars for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar pipes and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased before about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 through 2025, the cost of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar volume would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything worked well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the present day is going to go in history with security," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructure in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane mills came out, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar pipe factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, it is the Word, which he is most repeated, "Scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">To get the place, it formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the First Trial Chamber, the first letters started to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written around the fact that only concerning the parts that would be removed, addsat and the date are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, only the minister could surround any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">And the letters were transferred from there and the letters were increasingly frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-up factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still used sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another complex, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was in charge of his will at the standstill laying of the factory, whose construction helped he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part that he removed, he removed one of his 31 years of employment.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work of jobs was deleted.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located, were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth-speech of 21 October 2002, the then President in the eyes of the present people saw that he was guaranteed for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the people of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±ali learned that many things change, but not always to better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar pipe factory closed, or better when they began to throw them away, they also stopped working on paved road, also addenying other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region at once.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, its production is not even used for supplying the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he started working.</seg>
<seg id="682">Ninety-forty minded the old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Peso per month to spend the years after retirement in MaÃ±alich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with a few teeth and clear voice, is not a Christmas person, yet he gives the lies that you told him not.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been offering him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene is about 65 years of age, not because it is missing on strength, but because he is being tortured.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use Hip-Hop to express itself and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">A song of a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youths of the first Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do so by Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of touring workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014 workshop Manager mobile recording studios can accommodate directly to schools and youth centres to include youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStars worked together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop increases the fact that the young participates in discussions related topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptable," or whatever you can find in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and became invited to organise similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the field of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia is told, for example the story of Highway 16, also "Highway of tears," on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemhi Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to convey, how important is the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not rule out the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First nation was accepted, the refrain will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved a bit of help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip-Hop, who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in the heading, just a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like it would not ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to go on the earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you shall embrace our scream.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I think we will raise us up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead our adolescence as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">So you can do this for what it is the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and supporter of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the Strophe in Silicon (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly on the menu will be found close to the entrance shokuhin sansinu (people, "Plastic models of dishes") of every food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see this plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or walk.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry that devotes itself to the production of this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">The Kappabashi neighborhood is a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes created by the German filmmaker WIM Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese are those plastic dishes, usually they don't have any more money. a new trend is transformed today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matomas, the blogger itinii series published a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin of purple.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new plastic stuffed plastic bands, such as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kites collectors, such as in this case, fridge t magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shochin refrigerate for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences will increasingly become increasingly wasted.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (one popular rice bowl with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part is made for the Tokyo railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is a apple, who hold your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like a Apple, with a notch for the mobile, it is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight to the Komische.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon have betrayed, a popular topping with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can crust my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appetite form, for example counterparts or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile support has the shape of melting ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and gloves made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More sketrile plastic dishes you can view on: itinii's Naver Matter blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the quarter of Cappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with shokuhin sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against the organized crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for the victims of the fight against drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of in- and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against the drug trade" in Mexico the missing and killed ones regularly occur in statistics. however, this reflected not the extent of human tragedy that this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage on drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of the Sinaloa Kartell, pushed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day following a violent incident, someone looks back on the grief or to the churches that learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every Leiche, behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healing.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico is the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trafficking,") created a voice and told stories of people who were fighting for war crimes and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project such as:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime leaves us not only for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if stores close, because they are threatened by drug traders and all municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometers in order to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear of life") tell exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father that seeketh every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father's four siblings, her husband and two her nephew on a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task today we have released to go, and to the graves after the people whom we loved are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13th October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he was back again, but he never came back. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my Father, but it does not pay out to require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Apruna vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those that are afraid. we must demonstrate the international community of conflicts, the fragility and state of the state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post in Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, in which form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and Sensations journalism since several years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day, and see the title pages with pictures depicting only from a textbook for criminology or specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It will bring me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only, or sad. it seems like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be considered valid or consider this as a normal case.</seg>
<seg id="784">She further writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin think that he will be big (German: drug dealer) if it is great. and it is not normal that people listen to the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that when they would have lost someone who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weaknesses, if the stories come to a mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The human elessness of mankind is incredibly for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified that they were "excited."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to agree that they are spared from such tragedy, if they are not stir and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of extortion in the city district:" as an armed crime was looted as a family for month's money from their business until it was not only destroyed by the business, but also its family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think everything you lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain perverse over it, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The better we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She graduated with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that the others are arrested, because you don't know when to escape or kill yourself.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, whether weeping would solve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to live. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence called"</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he has asked questions, how to take care of the child of a little woman and a man who was murdered by organized crimes?</seg>
<seg id="801">What's it in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young ones of his age, whose parents will take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells us that he had to teach himself, how to make an egg whitish, potatoes, Tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacing with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are not important compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy who consists of violence and to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been past two years before, when he had only shot a few blocks from his home, the bloody fareche of his father, who was shot by armed men from an early running car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence through the organized crimes and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez is the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and the government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and enters into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories now live in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who have not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," the data journalism project Narcodata created in 2015, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug trade, which represented the country in the last four decades, in a comprehensively manner.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment in which it is about to raise a rumor or a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after it emerged about the first time? content in social media, whether it is true or untrue, tended to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been used to have been used to hold tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar in fact.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong coupling of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">It throws questions about our desire to News.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker secured the place of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, and exploded about 230 people.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa became a second largest country of years neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become a dangerous path full of headlights, which were difficult to ride.</seg>
<seg id="827">The former tankers fell victim to the tankers.</seg>
<seg id="828">Public officials reported a fire soccer, dozens of houses including a cinemas in the vicinity, which was full of people who showed the soccer World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Stilled houses and carbonated bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." by the Imgur-User Mystic Monkey, 12 January 2015.Frequently photos of the approach form the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of rough bodies, which are mounted on the ground during the people.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here is the story not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">More than the years later, the same photo was put out several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, real but not associated with regard to tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 the combatants of the Boko Haram took part in the unleased village of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyelids reported drastically of atrocities because they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and morn were used in streets and Bush.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one stayed back to count dead bodies," said a resident to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were tender, shot, or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only based on satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the army-based in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of the Boko Haram, country to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the figure out of the DR Kongo on again, as a proof of the fact and the extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of Missing descriptions; Africa Check has been documentaries to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was submitted as a letter for mass soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="852">Still a step further bring personal comments as such as this example will favored the image from the DR Kongo on sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange has also occurred in connection with the persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a registry, published by the United Nations, those who could flee punches, rape and some dead, some caused by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While other of the violence against the Rohingya reported, Posts appeared as the following: to summarise these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture is derived from an acidi-Arab news page that was due for 2012, the president Myanmars Thein also alleged that monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image of the DR Congo to hold this information.</seg>

<seg id="860">Traces of these decoupling diameters dates back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">You can see how far more information can be exceeded with the help of a "enveloped picture seeking..."</seg>
<seg id="862">A enveloped picture-search with the search engine in TinEye has found 344 pictures at 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the discussed image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixture of private parties, platforms of social media and community sites, as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (influences) which are going through this post. the first frame focus on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in relation to the murdered Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of cruelyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is subjected to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to investigate how images can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, what happens if readers will not support this pictures longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are ninety people who are unintentional, the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested this mood with false and false information that real atrocities are untrue and lubricated it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of massive pictures has already been made in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the back of pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern is that forcibly pictures and spectator despoise and give them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, seeking to help the forcible media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss the discussions in the news media, fact that they are not indispensable for today's news reports.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment, because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". they will thoroughly thinking about situation in which a picture can be somewhat below, but in which it can be replaced by the context or in completely improper way.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. unmistakable) ventures to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well-known today (such as the famous Portuguese acid) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish soslows).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist is persistent every attempt to a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for all time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treatment Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and Linguist, "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's sales language, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Wait yourself for your parents in recognition of how to satisfy you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>

<seg id="1000">We are located in a sea of parasols and people, some keep the iconic image of a woman with head cloth high, bound from an American flag, other skenings paroles against Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1001">My girlfriend looks at me and says: "these things concern not you, or?" "why, because I'm not Musha?" I ask myself.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I already led this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People, with whom I have been working or people who know me since years - the Sahar, who know it - by the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has built up in their presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They forcate me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practiced our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We thus identified to be a Muslim in different kind of art. but somehow we are all plugged in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims do not fit there, they are unmixed.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Unmuslized are misled</seg>
<seg id="1011">I get not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">That is even the poet, whose poetry is best sold in America: Rumi.</seg>
<seg id="1013">What images are coming in a sense when to think of him?</seg>
<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">As Jalaluddin Rumi was old as I am it now, he was an orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died, the centre of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western show the religion was deleted as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists of the reductive images of Muslims who have already colonized the western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This loosening imagery is determined by the dark men whom you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said entered the history behind these pictures in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But this pictures are still alive today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">But our politician, the news industry, and Hollywood would continue.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful, bad narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This Narratively oversees the reality that nine Muslim women have carried away their countries during the last three decades, while the United States did not choose their first female Presidential candidates.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narratively fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from taking their headscarf in public buildings and to cover the entire body by their government, which are both of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exercise his "control" to the "others".</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong Narratively weakens Muslim women to lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It looks like this, that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken in the American soil of Africans, who had been associated with slave hips.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This Narrativ has seized our collective preference power derart deeply and defective, that often sikh men and children to the goal of timacy attacks and chikanings are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, we tell and because of the kind, in which we tell it, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we can do more than just stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We are also able to help narratives the world to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry is said to capture the Narrativ of 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we are failed to see where seven million Muslims are in the highest grade "various" religious group in America. "</seg>

<seg id="1049">I shear, we do not bear all handkerchicks with us.</seg>
<seg id="1050">We must also be any theological experts to be "Muslim" or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport.</seg>

<seg id="1052">These lies are produced on the current volume of a well-lubricated Islamic Chronicles with Banknote Counter, Think Tanks and Experts for FalchInformation, which is our already faulty image of what a Muslim; or what Islam is, manipulated.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an option, here and now, despite a language barrier with somebody in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a short initiative of Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, the United States where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages should not be given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we are going to make cities that have disparity - safe rooms where inhabitants must not forget to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listen often is often associated to understand" intersecting these events instead "listen to," listen to feel. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format we need to explain their history first in their own language and explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional history, their devotion S.A. and their representation is that the audience ascries to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, than the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which will be told in the language Dafing. during this round the story ad Rassidatou conate also seize the opportunity to clarify the typical customs of the earth for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fable of the bunny and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After spending the meaning of his fel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grinlet, he shares his feeling of expression:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were aware...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organise their own histories.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new investigation of Puerto Rico, which amount to 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started during the puertorican Capitol, the government building of the capital city, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil front for the neuron of debts) and the ecumenical Church of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the new debts of the debts have also submitted an appointment at the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is your demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ros calls for that the politicians, banks and government agencies, who are responsible for the debts of their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We request a financial inspection and an Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed, our work conditions, which led to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refuses to pay a debt that is not their own.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Center for New Economy," a government-independent non-profit organisation without party affiliation with focus on socioeconomic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state of state.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ros requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book published in the last year and is free here, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the presence of the repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">There is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to borrowed how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true cost is to be associated with those.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artist, designers, developers, researchers, researchers and authors contributed to the movements for free knowledge, have been working on page to look over the fog, who around our newsfeeds and create something in our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of Adra prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title College collective memory gives his friends and his family, who want to express his release and they want to know it back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us will start to thinking about their own destinies, acts and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What do we have chosen for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What do we have given extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the web developer of open source and digital activity has been in custody for Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution, transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel reported on the basis of a" strictly heated "command from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented himself as an insider of the Assad government and made them aware of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition remain unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to know the audience around public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and at the moment of the ladder of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bass's cultural prototypes predicts as the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the intersection of numerous civilizations and here the Greek Roman architectural types with hiesful traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started with this work, the IS would fulfil all that architecture who will not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripping into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Bassel has not yet been able to finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent all my life, of freedom for dreaming and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought English to me, even when he had already been in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he taught other counties to read and speak to speak and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the door to the technology. he taught me to brewed both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other things, as they utilize computers, at least theoretically, without having stopped one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura spent a year long together on the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She tasted the lyrics by him when she visited him and translated them out of the Arabic world.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available for free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book covers from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens in every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sintered in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the occupations in the moment, in which we always embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers doesn't matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the offence of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I go in every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I wear with passion for myself,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes will say Lebeg</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul in you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return soon to my solitude,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the event</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassel's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assads, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian network for human rights) have disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who have been arrested or executed by the regime led by the regime, tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international Human Rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community calls for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat today our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption condemn the Director at provisional release again</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique responded to a corruption in which a governmental member relied after half of his sentence to the workplace in the State Council in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants with four other defendants to 22 million years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose council was appointed Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guided tour and prompted his remark to the company, which was then done on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion from the Attorney General of the Republic, which subject to the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza, to acquire his old post, as the company was no discipline after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">But many inhabitants will not see the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integration (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), an local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the German Wave, the decision of the company, the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the absence of transparency and even a step towards the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have noted that even the company should have set a discipline procedure against the resistors.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company silent, however, conceal no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behavior and considers the case as "opposed":</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza was a competent body, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay discussions and motivating words, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is competent, he approved to reintegrate himself into the company, which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistors!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political sciences in Brazil, says the director nor Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza, being rewarded from the state because he could not believe him, because someone claims someone in such a way that the state has already massively increased.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the moral to return and serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served on the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used the state, as handsome of an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of this man, who was charged and finally condemned to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºt preferred the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief has been in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel the Mozambique will not only stay for ever an independent President in memory, but also as sharp, trimming and - at the same time - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations, when he confirmed that "an ambitious man was unable to be able to sell his own ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>

<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is a criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions were also discovering:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and came free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racial word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored for many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmpae word "Kalar pae" means kichise or age-aging.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 impossible</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the renowned social network received their postcards from the net because they abstained the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or in general as adjectiv "Indisch."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook reports the word "Kalar," or, (in Burmical writing) as part of an initiative to view the widespread problem of the Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In the past few years, the ascent of radical nationalistic movements gave the word to an extremely seagant Konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has increased a lot of more meaningful content on his platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word does not call themselves in Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that Posts, where they discussed the use of the Word, or doubt for the purpose of his use, have been licensed.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with basic meanings, which have the same sequence of letters such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also'Kalar htaing 'as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(age-age),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' Calarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaate declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether they were crush, as he could reduce his back pain by making a word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set Ku la - "cure" (Ku) + the question word (la) to Burmese - is similar to the racial expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that it is allowed to reduce their own language by radical nationalists, but he also stressed that Facebook has to be analytical to spread all the posters that did in the suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar," not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are writing on factorook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">As you should make it instead, check the post carefully and check it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age-aging).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this three ckish nationalists, the Hassian speaking, will receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action I like to send a strong signal to any of the Hasselt, the efficiency of this strategy will not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship is often using a pitcher and mouse game, whereby users can simply start social networks, a new word or alternative writing of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook started to erase his poster when he only wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is exiled by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word was closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and given me the liken, post and parts of Content for 24 hours, because the Post Office says "the Facebook Community Standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posters that have no negative intentions or just try to show their views against the hate radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post office has been removed, which has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have had to do more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a prosperous intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words can be censored, only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems, as if they started without any local context or technical support, and as words as "chair" or "pediccurry" have been banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they did mistakes, they did not tempt the recovered poster.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they could only have more respect for the 15 million people who would have reported a big revenue, the great deal would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has received a lot of users among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it serious, users are talking about Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if their postcards are taken away from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which contained no Hasselt, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese Text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch the pediccurry and watch a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with homologation.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious foundations that have used social networks have increased to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt, in social networks, should act in addition to power in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On Facebook, Facebook was criticised for its failure to bring out the hate hate on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply satize the word 'Kalar', it would have better ongoing, particularly in context than code-concentrated initiatives and learnt from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 percent there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's Statistical Office of the country confirmed that in 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were contesting laws to abolish laws followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. no doubt they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went handy.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-Leader, for example, had no concerns to tell the criticism of the children's before they should take care of her own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition assumped for tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing and some doubts came to whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's before - despite 4 musters (including one woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained in the House of Representatives, where there were already a simple majority to make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the transformers of the country gave a status update to Facebook, which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill to the Child Labour was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate in the Senate, the draft may now be made to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was thrilled because the laws have been changed before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who clothed a ministration office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has plenty of time and unnecessary Gerede, which has devoured the core of the thing, but do you know what? children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson's opinion was, it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overhappy that the day had finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update to Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, - 35, - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folds Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil group that says rightly openly about the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now irrespective of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The proposed draft resolution was approved today, June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The House of Representatives has 41 deputies and of which 35 were present at the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members of the members who were opposed to the law have approved the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's reservation is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # childminage- childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who have released him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations to you.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Danke to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore the Secretary-General of the Sanhedma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-Organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj announces his intention to establish judicial steps, should the law be approved, and it seems to be redeemed.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, meant that Maharaj was to go against the law, most social media users wanted to do the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear sat, if we want to go instead of the discussion, in a way that could only invite you to talk about the state in our bedrooms, that the state is that the state of our daughters would be misused, that they may be misused against them, would then be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial control against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are in different gradations, or even the norm, even though there are laws that they are undergoing.</seg>

<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than one month, Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series defend against the plywood.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used to use websites are used to use tools for blocking sites (an current article from the New York Times), that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world, most ordinary Wikipedia articles are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been locked by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, has been taking place regularly blockades of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it is about massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continued to remain closed, several Mirror pages (sides, which reflect the contents of Wikipedia, and often shall be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the Interplan File System), when the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which does not make itself on the system of domain names and thus a complete Zenorship will be difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is unlocked in spite of the laws.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the messages (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to select snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This may help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they are not able to reach the www.wikiosa.org page.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also made aware that this stage was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and can only be used to screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to get the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansikanten.org, an open source of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that anyone can use other Mirror pages when it is closed in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and employee at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Days "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One gets to a different URL, which is not the original that you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server is running on the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are closed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1421">And his homey place next to the Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which directs the attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this superb location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wild photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was reading right at home when I suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti River was an Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I immediately ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to shoot pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">SUSS defines a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepalnature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so fear how they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he had already stood face to face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be annoyed from the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and there were mostly in a tent to make the Bardia National Park photos of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala, and was originally called on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released here as part of a content of content sharing.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India we avoid women with the greatest care, to discuss the name of their husbands or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Pronomen or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">By Maharastra to Maharastar and Uttar Pradesh to respect women to respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should dispense the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian State of OEa by a garrison and killed by their family and the village community after having addressed a secret called relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not involved in the name, is also widespread among men. however, they have far from less assignments when at all, they should not follow these practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Waldorf, in the district of Pune, in Maharastra, nine women, among them health professionals and housewives, a unique club and were thus fast to the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone to discuss and discuss the hostility of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs, which are in 13 Indian states, is part of the campaign # Khelpal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and uses for the exploitation of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices, such as pediatrirat to join HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously at ambassadors inside the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini shown in her discussion round, traded by women who did not call her husbands on the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic because she was able to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that could easily identify the women.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to arrange the name of their husbands, is a custom that they are guilty to all the demands and never have put in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition bear witness that she respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep this, will be regarded as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have made us up to this discussion round thought.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to try her husband never before, at home, try out at home, as it runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussions-round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-mother and my husband still weigh long after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any number of participants to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, offended, loving, affectionately and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, means that they cannot respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be equal to it? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day that they brought up the name of her husbands concerning the lips," says Rohini Pai from the village of Walhe in Maharastra over the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women can never be expressed in the name of her husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she just bowed down during the whole exercise. another decided to allow the entire infected frustration against him and his family expelled it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline frenzy, with an ancient fires broke, the women decided that they would actually try to take home their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in his head: his wife could not cease to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-mother murdered them, she was afraid, and told that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said," I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tries to stop other practices, such as taking the interest in the red point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the jointed red point if he would also open it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I heard it, that he might bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not listen completely with it, but my, they are now in a better position to choose it, even in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can replace their views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a excursion with every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the box.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to take care of women who could hear what could hear, "says she.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthday celebrations in their lives for the first time in their lives. they danced and sang about things that they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have linked up some things, such as our identities on our husbands, never so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great, certain things to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talk about the concept of honor, and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have taken care of only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of it is okay, but some wanted a salesman-Kurta, a large shirt over a trousers; they have not settled.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a great strife and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes selection, the morals connected to Saris and much more, uggale Rohini is her own pair of curtas (upper hemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to make it possible.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question whether you have changed slightly in the five months of its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they listened to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, enclosed me, make it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women carry on at each time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that changes they would like to reach in their lives - as the feiling for more freedom of movement or its own hangers - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In making them self-confidence, it will be aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman is in the club to house and others speak about what we're talking and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from exited groups in India and do videos about stories that will not be reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "News of those whom they experience," and offer a hyperlocal context to report about global human rights and development claims.</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: Netitias Under Serious threat, December 2012 (in English) Neun reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and Dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that probably made it recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo had assumed attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (State endangered), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred Lius Case as "an internal matter" and a spokesman tells it, he did not require it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will still receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, who allow him to allow for a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely covered.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise printing around Liu as a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions concerning Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize in Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian authorities decided to do nothing with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to come back to China, because exports have been mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message has spread, that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee created his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to fetch his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his detention, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top graduate of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on the release of Lius as she wrote in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We expect at the same time that China lifts all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">You should meet all visits and receive you who want it and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad spoke to him that Americans have the possibility for the treatment abroad, insofar as it was possible to help him in his genesis. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27, that the embassy would like to leave the Chinese authorities, not only free Liu, but also his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The withdrawal of U.S. embassy moved into a desert answer from China, with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to make a unique and immoral remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel agencies and access to the medical provision of his choice, to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in the congress to negotiate the Chinese government on it, Liu and his wife unconditionally release.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu became "all the medical support that he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Before reported diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had considerable concerns if the host could be able to refund Liu the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called for the right to provide reasonable medical care and give it the opportunity to reproduce themselves from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP before, that Liu Ms. Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police still supervised the room in the hospital, and that it is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada challenged China to safeguard its international human rights issues, including free freedom, and to allow for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to allow humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures have to be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments, which he needs, regardless where, required. furthermore, his wife and his family may contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news broadcaster France Info already reported that the French government could welcome Liu in the country, there was no further information that France will take it at the end of France.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the landlord of Taiwan called for China on 27 June to allow leu free and require a larger tolerance towards those that require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">In Taiwan, the Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu has also called to allow China to allow the sick to be informed of intellectuals liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed very worried in a declaration on June 28 around Liu, and gave heed to pray for Lius Well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that he took the initiatives that he took and could lead to a harmonica, more stable and wealthy China, what might have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moving and encouraged, as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed the Charter 08 for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: town or Land?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore. Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear silly, as Singapore is recognised by an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the New York association of the New York Association, the ministers noted that many people criticised the predominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compare Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He underscores that Singapore should be considered the city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, with most people going a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In Cavalierio, the Minister of Justice, accused the Justice of Justice, to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and promises to create this valuable land, we say that we would not be any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the request of a flight to the responsibilities, a compulsory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of what, he appeared unmistakably.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York as well as cities that are permanently led to a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject, the good old Leier of the authorized representative will resurly come to the penguessing logic, leaving the twisted logic, because it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final effect, in the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests in regards to our press, our studies of our studies, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions depute with non-answers of rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion since she didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so towards which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand not.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful when our value K Shanmugam would take on the efforts to clarify this point if he was paid up in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog its comment, he tells us that it should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference, in order to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the publication.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said that Singapore was rather a "city" as a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore said so uneasy, even if we are looking forward to free and righteous elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He is visiting Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw their decades a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said, Singapore was no land, "he obviously didn't know it in that sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan reveals his disappointment about Shanmugam, who makes the leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that I expected to agree with them or not, but that is a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is true and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review The weaknesses of Shanmugam Argumni:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "has committed an error" or was it a mudger driver?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">But when not, on which land go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the department of the government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why are the people more expensive their military service, but they did not defend their country, but they do not defend their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink number of staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In, the Journey Journey of a Decade regarding the assertion, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This pack seems to have many more people more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear about the defense of the country mainly "etc." but this is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak rather from the defense of the town.</seg>

<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his editors: what is the most miserable aspect of your residence or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of a consecutive row, with rumours revealed on certain parts of the world and a different facet should be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is made by me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry," I am sorry, "I am coming from Canada." I am coming from Canada. I have been living in Japan since 1994.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation in which situation the conversation takes place, it is considered to be courteous to show interest in his talk time by adding personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarification the standard answer is: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many cans are cooking in front of rage if they are held for Americans, but I don't interrupt.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For anyone who does not know it, there is little, which distinguishes us Canadian of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians put a Canadian flag well visible on her backpack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always married little monkey sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender marriages are already legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think of Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We often say very often. sorry. "</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also is supposedly considered the tolerant country for ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I wonder.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would not account for me if one would change my example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "cute."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "cute," is basically to be careful - like the gutted, gentle, but tragically important figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has a own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem exists in that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing on which one can hit.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless his name is unobtrusive and uninteresting to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, remote from the things that pass around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I even'd go to say that the wish is, free and alone to be a major supporter of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">As a "cute" figure, it is perhaps easy to cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians are not often talking about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm-hearty, open kindness, which I now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau then entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "kind." our prime minister has done some sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a Pop-Band parodiert Thailand Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous pop-band has released a music video that took the Junta parodiert who seized power in 2014 and in spite of their way to restore civilian government, still governs the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phaze Girl) of the band tattoo describes a young man which tells of it that rules his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the continued military regime of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was blessed by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video charged was shared on Facebook 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin-Video "dictator was even blocked in Thailand, after a group of activist activates the public to view this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">It is possible to interpret the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, in particular as it holds to the country's position under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once these recordings of the video which relate to some of the political issues that have been pursued actively in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may potentially refer to the drastic Section 44 of the provisional Constitution which granted the commander of the host of an absolute decision on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program to "Settings" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are watched by the Junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the Act on Cybercrime against, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to concede activist and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit in the army was established, supervised by the online content and persons having accused of having left the monarchy having prosecuted the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand requires a strikage against "lese Majeste '(Majority).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a putsch of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta remains pursued, is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and the waste of tax veins.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it's even shown how people will be thrown into a black vans before they bring them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and users will violate the monarchy to their monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are mentioned in Asia Minor in AbchAsia.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico it houses "Mama Africa" Migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez is a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the PRI.org website and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula and is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59th year-old Mexican female, a small woman with corals pink Brilleneck and gold coloured earrings in teddy-form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This surname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they) became a target for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on a transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, grinding, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez's wife says the people in full little buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept inside cartons outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She desires to reject no pair.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medications that they cannot pay them, they massaged them with a balm that hit the long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in front of a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked if Mama Africa is a reasonable top name for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghter) posing him with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracks.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to get there her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States usually to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had owned by other bankers of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Afrikaner often travel the track and that the Africans speak about the WhatsApp of Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his position leader, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance, and worked as a construction worker at the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">As the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact him in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again," he answers and will always stay in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells that her guests must send their times text message if they continue to grate them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They declared that Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but its guests have taught it, chicken, as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is very well-known, but it is not the only sparking hope for migrants who travel through tapestula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a cul-asse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Valenzuela and his family immigrants from this winter.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and found that Busters will be sold too expensive for African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking point outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," says he. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled out of the United States after a raid on his labour.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels to Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents, also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he was fled with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to express his money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and a Unknown, one single one, has offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is everything full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers were quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">How a proud grandmother will show them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with african hair care that you have made a spin, some photos of her grandkids and many travelers more, kids and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">They are sad, while she briefly presented them.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fuerone," repeats them every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-Point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang from The Bike user.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority area in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the cell phone users received the Tianshan district of Urumqi a mobile phone-notification in which they set up the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In communication, it is said that the app will be given access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities approved the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app, shortly after they had replaced the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic web pages, by online scam, Troians and Phishing-pages to give attention to them how much time they would spend on online, and control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with filters for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in a versatile way.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the remote control "state actors or even hacker may able to manipulate or steal your home network's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital Zenorship in China mostly focus on the experience of user in major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme toughness and surveillance measures, as well as routinely Internet depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media outlet for "images from" China "(people), the censored news in China released, showed photos by a Checkpoint where the policemen experienced the residents indiscribed whether they had installed monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you're using a checkers with one device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">That is a form of captivity by the start-up technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"image from" China "(Halls) has also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can raise the password needs of a Windows OS, and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang could possibly be a reaction to the statements of the town council, to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office when running their computer and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report by Freedom House, a US-American Human Rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">On June 27, in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities published their "personal ID cards, mobiles, external drives, portable hard drives, portable hard drives, laptops and media cards" by the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obvious to identify any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy it. this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole range of potential expiry, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in the series "sleep or death," in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane signs his experience in a Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Far away from our blue, virtual world you look at and stello that you are quite alone in a place where everything has gone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything changed after and after disbanded and disclosed the truth, which is clearly visible, both inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One who makes its name all honor.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A dedicated to a list of feelings and expressions, that allow no metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But if you bring the reality back, and look behind the scenes - beyond the theater, the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All the doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even if the Earth is moving on the axis of the evil. you're sure that you are here between the walls of your parents, who have built your parents here, and before them your grandparents, stone by stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They have arrested me and my father three times, but this did not have enough to form "my Lesson," as the chief of the security instructor it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He set his power over us, knowing even the simplest concepts that we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were killed during a peaceful protests like any herb from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to get the city the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" -Schreies.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the city district coveted itself, just my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, excelessly, at the wrong time, even if I put no high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state-of-organisms and their accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night the things were calmed down after the power supply stopped in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I underwent silence in that I cried several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice caused by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt good enough to assemble.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends closed to me; we talked to a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations and filled all.</seg>
<seg id="2013">At such a moment it will be aware that you freeing the Spirit from the lamp, but it's not interested in the least.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "makes you ready to meet us at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can go - nothing can return your voice after you have led them all the way up to the office of security service from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I joined there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan was there with several of his men. my father was already there, as I did.</seg>

<seg id="2022">What I did, did nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time that I stood before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Perhaps it was foolishness to my foolishness; perhaps in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure when I said: "I didn't think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I have never stopped to see you in my eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest conversation, which such fateful consequences for me could, and I do not regret any word from what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"Forests him in detail and his father equally with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father was like with it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stank of this waste set is mine until today in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became one of the syndrome, "a seelic torture, which I was suspended for months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I am a farmyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything that I carry with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Afterwards, through the farm and into the second office, which leads through a course to the single cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I imagine all the details exactly before I care in the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Different than anything else, they were assigned to a bigger cell in this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share them with only one another prisoner, and may immediately stop me without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes, like a whole life, the civil servants left the cell, and I laid back on an old well-established communication method: to beat the fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell was a "adult detainee."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long time he was told me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in no one of the surrounding cells, a respected husband's middle age who looks like me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness, no experiences can be seen in me, and doctors do not have them here; we are all just numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe somebody, whose voice are similar to my sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers have an existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the major cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assures me, they would not spare, if I abide.</seg>
<seg id="2048">LÃ¼gner.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would like to have had a bird of birds to drive all these crows that labs at the fruit in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From afar, I still listened to "Allahu Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cry is irreous, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black saw the color of destruction, until I saw the yellow light, which presented us the horror by the person: the Raad (about: "thunder," anew on the 13th Sure of the Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"you are here to listen to."</seg>
<seg id="2055">Thus the secret was detoxified: in order to protect the State Security and to prevent the terrorists of the terrorists, they talk to us in the alawitty dialect - so they played their counterfite decision and deepen the close field of view of its world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">That is no house, which is not here is no land; it is a curse that they call Koexistence to turn the criminals of their sound in a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I supervised the hearing room and meet to Abu Imad, a slim and stocky man; at least it comes to me so.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, despite the facial expressions that are still young, you're still young, you can join them to protest when you join this days. and to protest demonstrations to protest you soon. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I answered not.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I was accustomed to answer it, not to reply.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say more precisely when vouchers and strokes have become a friendly conversation with me to become common communications equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened, was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me said that I had to be sorrowful if I had to be punished, though I had done nothing to make this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">This is a penalty in all of its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to rip me as much as possible from the body.</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can not measure you with it, and you can't keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries were not yet enough, why they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest I asked if the investigator had been working earlier than garbage heaters, or whether it belonged to normal working conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables attached to each other to present themselves from their view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour, three of them will be changed, while still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, why I ceased to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noted the cooling of the cooling, and found no pleasure in it. why he first took him as the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Current flow through my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body, which was thrown out on the ground, was the perfect guide.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The depless disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two horrible hours, he decided that he had met his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lay myself again and let's say that this was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschficer."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I am answering the voice of one of the young people: "my lord, my father, must make a fearful worries."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and hold you, you will be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had been released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib covers the majority of its time indoors; sometimes he shuffle his computer, sometimes to his computer, and also back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But if one can depend on it, a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine fleece has to be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the chief of his family house that belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where it lived as fellowyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who asked the conservative majority and asks their old tried opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free expression proclamation through art and Rapid.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry. all these issues are not just found in its hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities that reach Damascus in Yemen by far as Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not restricted in its thinking by borders, and it can suffer according to his own statement with the people who have suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though it is not open, he stimulates a special ascent against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war regions, anything like to do with his identity as "Palestinian Povoltant of the second generation," he himself referred to as well when he was born in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living things," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that I'm a man when he shook the nest of NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in that time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise until sundown.</seg>
<seg id="2105">In addition, the Jordanian law declared that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib revealed a certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions. on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensual hot jitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle the ssores are lukhot coffee and the waiti of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when one cast a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water to drink, not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan had cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections which support the Islamic State Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual acts of Hamed seno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country speaks and the main reason for the concert table was.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the owner.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism that authorizes the most proven legitimacy of the regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila raised the jordan people as "progressive supporters of human rights" that continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural manifestations."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be shimmering Rhetoric, but in fact a clearly significant source of crystalline reality occurs in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib led traditional gender norms to body by having abusing his vision of Arabic women who prefecture sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently well-known woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of honorary positions has risen to Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary affairs came to its peak in 2016; however, there is still lack of institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence to assist in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fragile control of the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of a danger of violence, "and for their release is often unbureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will nothing happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music is pleased to announce great popularity and is known to dismiss it in its country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, but he is thinking that he's his music that is full of explicitly on Sexuality, freedom and opinion, is not able to separate politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">To me, politics was declared, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is again on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse-story repeated itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is" too. "</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further development of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get, in his words, "that can," be faith or belief, hetero or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that anyone speaks heavily in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya, in order to realize that his comments were torn out of the context, progressed and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance speaks to homosexuals not to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuan, a poets of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat was to work once in the task of the caliber, in the eighth century nobody could write about homosexuality, why can Jordi do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against free expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took several former government representatives and members of the teacher's teaching, with the reasons that they had expressed in social media criticising the problems linked to the deep deeply rooting corruption discovered by the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the gig of Hdaibs's opinion, only the tip of the iron - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of Jordanian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him is the progress of a permanent foe. Jordan has denied a stand for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - this is what Hdaib - is made of slow, insider and insistence changes. it is certain that these changes are due to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, how millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dread not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be affected by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streumitions and artificial art. at least hopes it hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Up to the end of this, Hdaib becomes transduced and therefore also resistance can afford.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman is among student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant strokes are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a version of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the Festers, drums, and dancing more than one thousand years ago, were in the armies from the west Japan in the northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emigrants.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few amazing seats, so we got a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have a look at the Meguro Gajoen after a long time. I've just been seeing the Meguro Gajoen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival will take the only True - and to spend a breath of his summers to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched me the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The observation of a 18 metre high tide was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus main port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoking and illegal drugs are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">In April 2017, a survey published that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not be sure.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, visual appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyle of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to that more normal citizens can create, into the experienced hands of hairstyle, which can imitate these elaborate hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairdresser, which go to the outermost borders of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, taking the competition of the hairstyle "Batalla de Barberos" which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts from each other to show who can create the eccentric of Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos at current contests is available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalvo.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "love Forbidden to guerrilla," which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet a lot more important, people who feel outbreaks to show speaking affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question went exactly this question from the two young Colombian activists. Leonardo PÃ¡rraga von der Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, based on the campaign Carta por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters on reconciliation), who encourage young people to write guerrilla pants letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just before short, their country was the field of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), which forms the Schluspoint of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The mediation of the peace agreement was considered as important that the president President JosÃ© Manuel Santos offered for his merits in the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Columbus, however, a long way until one can talk about an actual reconciliation and peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock their guns now have to integrate them into life as a civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, which had used to life in constant anxiety and in some cases, has to record into their ranks, and support them into the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian showed that the young Columbus would close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love-messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrillas, who then should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of the reconciliation was held at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which was held in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the man we love to write on Day thousands of love letters, but those who forgot to need them much more needful.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He created he told us to share his love with people this year, who breathe in the most urgent inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now have to build their seats in society and have to establish a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make discourse the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is present in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive anyone '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the town council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt reists to store the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done earlier to meet the orders of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts but letters full-saving of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness and everything that lies between," told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governors of Valle del Cauca Province, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter made me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Camlords" (a kind of refuge in which the guerrillas live), I saw a guerratic, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go back because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the sleep sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I asked him, "hello, what do they mean?" he said, "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless epistle.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life I wrote something so beautiful, therefore I respond to it. "then suddenly I got to tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him, and put me beside the Granatwerfer.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, and was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be a shock at this writing, and would help to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never tried some other from life as war. the FARC was the only possibility to retain him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside there, who is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rule, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the outset, students and some of the FARC were assembled in a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were up all up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the Leader of the FARC declared the story of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help us to create a political party in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For one goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people heard that never had found hearing and did not know that people who were often seen as monster, and even hate those who were often turned by their habitats and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The truth, in which the land lives, does mine hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - even those who are killed, and so much damage can have caused us to give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote in the example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalvo, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columnering has prophesied that after the deformation of peace, it would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it gives inequality, hunger, and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to attack weapons and to protest for their rights. and that's completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC now on peace to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore we call all defenders of peace - regardless of the race, religion or ideology they belong to themselves - above all those that rise from a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our post and sacrifice, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those of those who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasian region are exposed to a wide range of hazards - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and compressors.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With horror, activists have experienced the coverage of the last months over the persecution of the persecution of Chechnya in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that depends like a reclonal value of the LGBTQ assembly, was not only produced by night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of their experiences with us and speaking with us what is currently in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago LGBTQ-legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines, after reports were published, which quefied the drag, torture and killing queurs men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gaseta; it threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, suspected quefied men, and caught up in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a woman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt a woman since her childhood, in fact she was a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they were grown up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so they moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group had experienced a group of sex workers, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear for her life in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">This was a friend of Dagestan, a Transwife who captured in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I was trying to help her, he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the Internet, with my phone number and a picture from me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that these shame can fix these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, photos from my documents marched through the whole WhatsApp round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just right there was a couple of shopping lovers from the back seat of my cars, I heard a mascot: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt somewhat in my body, but I did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set but this time on Chechen: "how long will you be able to honour the family, you wallow?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awoke up the last end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had all of them and began to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulances were you laid - in whom the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, since there is still my male name, but the doctor understandstill and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Therefore I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with fear, it was a Muslim name, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They call me, they wrote me - relatives, strangers, some perfect unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of an alpha.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to restore me to Chechnya in order to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They found absurd claims: some said I must prove it by taking the streets above without the roads; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Grozny, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a grain size C - what should I should say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only her family but disappointed the entire Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not touch you because you are a pious woman, but you need to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a snare to the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Thankfully, the neighbours therefore came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened window wheels and a licence plate with a 95 drauf.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the numbering plates that it was discovered that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I will not give their names, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still do not realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without briefing for me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I connected the SIM card to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother via Whatsapp, I got a message: "you don't believe, if you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already, in which hotel you are. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the sex bales, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">As a few traditional cascasian elements, I still carry myself in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish to overcome this seelic barrier, I cannot overcome it.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with the camera, I actually give me much effort to look like the person, that they look from their past - so is my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have drowned?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who had injected one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that Ramadan was not arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will be on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Thus, I call them, they probably invite you to see the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood Genugtug.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also now detained men in this secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of myself says that there weren't many many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, in particular, those that have no rich relations or left out of their relatives in order to put the Kadyrows of judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be detained there, to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they might attack any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped to radialize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a grief or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just had to cancel someone at one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown to beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new to them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">So, this so called Lord, this person was taken away when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not introduced as Bandits, yet there were no reports yet. we suspects that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have been permitted to shave any of these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and demonstrations of people who belong to a so-called "nontraditional" orientation had already been held in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grozny, when I had lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to lead us to the "civilization" but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows apsed; I had coloured lashes, wore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Education of Sharia has never bent me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, mainly on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and all the city knew about it, knowing why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speechatthing: lush lad lad. that means: "Spoats not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children if they're talking about sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so you simply have their eyes shut up before you because they believed that you are ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have never fought, never chased and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be observed?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk on TV via Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us, but priority over the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who was watching before, and laughed, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic has grown steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I'm working as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I didn't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not too much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still operate as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I have communicating with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teats, merry, I buried them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I'm not a penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I found these people myself when I'm influous.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alumber.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as the Cherry, who wanting to make your foam fire before your mouth that there are no coils on them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans who have the Kabardiner have also known the Russians also; but on all the planet there is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm coming from there, so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims who go to the mosque and fasted together in the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about transidental immunity to men who love men, and they believe that men are changed to make more intimate experiences. but that is a hclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation, to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">It is the most important to feel me to feel me in my own skin and I am not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Do not know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I personally will be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad about that. I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in self-morale within the impoverished Arabian ancestwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">Iranian Ahwaz region suffer from an unusually high unemployment - and poverty within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase of self-morals.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27 the despair situation of the Arab Ahmadazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child. he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to come up for his family, so Ahwazi-Human Rights groups who want to work and anonymous in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube made the moments after it had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to delete the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide in August in the Arabian ancestor-minority interests, and activists from situ before that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights filed that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing together: they were all family fathers that felt right due to persecution from the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab Jamwazi community live in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, causing the native Arab population to contest their living content.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power to power in 1925 to terminate ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran next to the oil and gas fields as well as some of the wealthiest and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population receives only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and unloading.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi-Arabs systemic jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the water of the Arab territories into the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom have to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These twins have led only to destroy the devastation devastated in the region, and the local agriculture as well as the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Kooperative, Labour and Social Policy, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who have completed a job, completed in primary school, 55% have completed a secondary school degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor-human rights activist with residence in London, Global Voices told that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment is yet worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancestors of Ahwaz newly registered ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions need to be set up Arab workers, the local Arabian Ahwazi will deprived the access to work facilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">That is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and to force them outside their homeland Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their advantages and surnames to hide their affiliation to Ahwazi and so, since even Arabic name at work will not be tolerated, sofar because the speaking of Arab language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activist alarm, before the situation gets explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world awakes and it does not take it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why not I identified with the feminism, also with the intersectionality not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. this article was the object of several discussions where many different positions for expression came.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, there are many women - especially white women who are characterized by themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even have well thought out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we would generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, when it comes to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women or later lives in various fields of life on a glar ceiling, and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it, and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I say on skin colour, on black cis women, on black transidente women, on black transidente women, on black women in the LGBTI community, or on black women from the Diaspora; if I refer to what kind of physical and verbal movement, there were many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all of them all agree that women - all women should come together to take "their voices, and" Kumbaya, my lord 'to sing "to attain the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it in addition to sexualised violence a form of institutionalized form racial violence, which we are exposed to black women over two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that, black women and women earn less as a white men and women as well as women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are often referred to as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spinhens and women with a migration background exposed to a higher risk are exposed to domestic violence and violence in the partnership as the white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand I want that all men, all men, and all men, neither have any skin colour the same rights. on the other hand, I can not connect to a black woman to take into account of the white woman, who refuses to take into consideration the gender as well as on the skin colour of one person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm inexhausted and I will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist oriented sphere, which always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">He mourned in 1851 in their speech: "am I no wife?" and I also refused me to maintain a ideology in the black woman in a historical aspect of a human and marginal being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuted me to join me groupings, which also absorb through cultural enrichment of our customs and customs, to drive their egocentralized program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I won't try to increase white women to increase the importance of cutting of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honour one better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was formed in order to give women from different approaches a home and disseminate from the white feminism, the word "Feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I'm putting it full, full and full of feminism and I join the movement of Womanism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than me for a white-feminist paradigm, that is so persistent, that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and give us to the hospitals that will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves to create our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, seelic, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately cried, after they have read these lines, I pray you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can raise borrowing women and women of other cultures, as I existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a field, in which my life doesn't survive, nor ignored, still denied.</seg>

<seg id="2467">This article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that is inexplicit about international efforts to solve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">This article will once again be published here in the scope of Content Wararing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Always again, Nabil Musa travelled over the last 7 years - usually with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. its mission aims to deliberate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains to us its relationship with the influences of the region and the effect of contamination in his municipality.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fears that the decades of war, the construction of dams, soiling and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation of the Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, to protect the rivers, streams, and water ways in Iraq, as well as local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was filmed and published in Erbil for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist, published in Erbil.</seg>

<seg id="2477">Paraguay women and their more difficult fight against violence</seg>
<seg id="2478">One group women represents "The crying women" in order to express their pain on women morals in the country and in the region, and to show its rejection.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurdish. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilichefraubin), reported about violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police station Ada BÃ¡ez told us that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their partner, who had become violent opposed to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship has passed some time and the police said, their statement would be laid to the actuators, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">Another wife Balbuena was impacted because of mistreation, also the exact review of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the Teufelskis of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women attend all once, they do not receive support by the State in general.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men whom they misworked. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit violence to be victims of violence at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Including impacts and Statistical Instruction 2 Invisible mistreation and a legal system that nothing inferior 3 of the laws: good approach, deficient implementation of impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for Genderers on Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y EStudio, a social scientific research institute in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not indicate the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," they are declared.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the Attorney General Attorney got 9600 ads owing to domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5,000 ads owing to domestic violence to peace. 86% of advertisements were found here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In ads, 40% of women said that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of this criminal offences are actually shown indeed. "on every woman who will be reimbursed in Paraguay for psychic missions, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">Upon every woman, that is due to physical mistreous display, two women who do not do this, stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women in Paraguay had no own criminal offences, the prosecuting authorities can not document adequate how many women will be murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days a woman died because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that doesn't take nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she was not actually wanted to do this, but then she was to regret it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she carried the psychic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it before it, I always thought that the only woman happens to fall down, because they can be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>

<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described its interests and different attacks during their two-year relationship, and related how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to involve that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long by Carlos, and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed to be almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain fellow-debt.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not found in Paraguay, fought in Paraguay with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner was harassed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can speak with others about their experience, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do that what many other people do not do: they accept the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner managed to convince them to convince them that it was valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads remained with the authorities without a result of their relatives and did not get support from their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against its former partners, who developed to become a discreet legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country where it mainly grew by money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws, which are very good but are not applied.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, in the Paraguayan Parliament, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Ensure) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill can be seen before, Female has to explain the inconstant tighten criminal offences, as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia the case.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislature was changed in some points to change the MPs for the Law, that the way for the decriminalization of abortions, which currently banned in Paraguay, and can be penalised in Paraguay with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The bill was foreseen to give the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost, which currently carry the victims of violence themselves even if they just want to retain and secure accommodation, to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri could be argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial funds for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreation is seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink is to take place, that violence is no longer regarded as a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep silent in view of these facts is reflected and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetual davonage.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to add such a long display until failure should not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously parts of the law had been modified, but among other things, a passage has been canceled, which had called up the partner in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding reconciliation was considered the opportunity for the aggressor to attack his sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of words "sex", "political power" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is considered great setbacks.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia where he takes place with his incomprehension.</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or even mentioned in the media. these are a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for taking medical research on-site medical research. there are many medicines and vaccines that cover special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have become more serious than elsewhere in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by Pharmafermen are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists are carried out in construction of its own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warriors is Director of the Centre for Infectious disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious consequences for the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he found himself on the HIV virus before being decided to go back home to assist the samic healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on misunderstanding of media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment on the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambische national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the major current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay recipient instead of having to be Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get, are often not suitable in our area, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from USA and Europe</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people that come back or come here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you had not before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interested, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are requirements for special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, investigation of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientist in Africa over western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and the readings access to scientific expertise that indicate challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible on payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine published by the solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salads since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outputs, the first plant cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been eaten.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years, mortons work only became known only through its own objection and the question as many salads can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not be able to breathe so far.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or greton or ruffled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years more such patents have applied to more plants such as cereal or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmenters and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of thousands of old tradition, Morton still does require salads, it is now longer, since its work is still greater than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when in a river, boulders should be a boulder, around which I must move.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents will go to Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breathe out some new salads, because all the features have already been patented, "it makes so good as possible and tries to find out those features that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, however, it is very careful and endeavoured to use any material that is being protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is always increasing in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS drew red tubes of the variety Outredness in the greenhouse "greenhouse" the station, cultivated and eaten. there it will be tested if plants could be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name is more so sounds, than that the movement from the IT area should come from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to inspire the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched into life in order to ensure that some plant species and gens are not being protected as a spiritual property, which can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, U.S. breeders can undertake that others can use the seed-free from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to business and sell it. "open source" breeders can only allow others to move it to their own varieties and are not immediately removed - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant accounts.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeding and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffere prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi's Executive Board, Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, there is a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little to use, trying to breed seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Klodenburg is emphasised that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or genetically modified ones in the global agricultural industry. "those who are offered good, locally and sustainable reproducible vegetables, such as it is offered on farms in rural markets, should also know that the way is bred, that the species is farmed, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make other her seed remains free at hand. thus, its approach is to be patented by contrast, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supports to argue that the future of food provision is endangered because the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous Intellectual Property Rights on plant material, which is thus unconditional, unceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with the genetic variation of carrots and their availability. she found that about one-third of all cartels are protected as a spiritual property, making it possible for plant breeders either not or can be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby avoids that massacres of wheat as wheat in even larger style patented as a salad or carrot.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visiting</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so cultivated that they provide specifically developed attributes - such as their taste or their color enhances until such as thrive in certain environments and threats as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, since the changing conditions are unforeseeable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanen activities. with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the United States set up the company for the maintenance of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">They contradicts the view that intellectual property can promote other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties of innovations." "a patent is basically taken a plan which can follow as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Therefore, such protection inhibits innovations not, but promotes them to provide the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks quite different: for 20 years, until a patent expires, make sure no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if they are waiting for a long time waiting for plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument of Morton, however, is that genetic resources always have been a general practitioner and it continues to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetous incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it is impossible to us, if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton stimulates the concept of plant features: "we have not designed the features really.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form themselves, and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "whoever breeding a variety, also breeding its own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their growing custom herbicides are needed, breeding in his sorts of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very contrary. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While a few medium-sized companies (such that are in international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, make it the most smaller seed companies, even without patents, either reject it, or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not remuneration or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for breeding in his breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders could be more innovative: "it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new products, more than the company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my sorts in a few years, "says he." with a patent you are protected from the competition for 20 years. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept spreads very quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organisation in resources, an "open source" plant breeding program works in the centre with farmers together and helps them to identify new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports you to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreements works on an "open-source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding are different from country to land, in due to Ossi's commitment, the Ossi obligation can not simply be one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission explains that conventional cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the present practice of the European Patent Office which permits the patents of conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now part of the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office for this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, based farmers, operators of seed companies and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the "open source, seed and seed companies, and the global trend for godentation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for hivos' program for "Open Source" seed sales systems that the organization is currently a global alliance for "Open Source" seed production systems which will be scheduled to fall next year of the official start of the year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit-development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed in seed.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a group of aid organisations like the WK Kellogg Foundation, published by McKnight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to bring out seed and to improve seed policies, thus ensuring a stable supply of food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also the importance of a varied, local utilities with seed for sustainable food systems underlines - a connection to the Luby of Ossi, hoping to recognize him soon more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food is especially counted, where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we now try to clear the people, that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August the Egyptian government locked the website of the HNetwork for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The "Network for Human Rights Information continued in spite of this attack, and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution in the Arab world. even though it was never so difficult to overcome these goals, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities would be exhausted to overcome and do not unlock. we hope to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first licensed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after authorities started more than two months 21 web pages, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web links to the victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights abuses Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog to spreading column and articles which he writes in Egypt not accessible web sites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog which he set up in order to avoid the Censurce of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of the Dada blog is native, however is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being reported by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the students protested and took a video, as the police experienced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article turn primarily by politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a facebook review, Ziada expressed a pluck by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the bloom of blogs may not meaningfully for the world, it is now for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is managed to mediate to me the feeling of a siege; an arrest, attempted murder, summons to the national Security Council, rejection blogs, as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even though only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I took it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after having blocked him, and that they may have fear of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The bold go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and expression (AFTE) unlocked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages. this provided technical testing in the network of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the pletion of providers that was possible by Internet Security Networks (VPNs) as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we realized like the rejection of websites that offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a specific practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents and to filtering the Egyptian user may have access to the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also limitated, that the decision makers must be closed behind closed doors, which the Egyptian population does not have legal basis, with the help of the crimes against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it as next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day per day, newspapers in the whole Brazil season with dolls headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postal services drawing.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in an andonated financial situation, the force of force in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice called to be able to access the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are allacceptable and this is unacceptable & # 8212, at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In this way, the report published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio well-known newspaper "Extra" on the 16th of August is not normal, "in which she announced, a new section called" war in Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes reported in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual offences, etc. everything that however, however, will be published in Rio "section" War in Rio "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative in order to close as journalists in front of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of Chief Editor, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist, in the newspaper, explains that according to information forwarded by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories will be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse if it is distorted so that, as it can be used, atrocities of the police who only shoots and then asked questions to do.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the designation "War" more than it profit?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued that violence as "war" has argued. this is their opinion in a justification of failed security policy by the media and could be worse, responsible for calculating the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself has shown - in combination with insufficient investment in staff, Enlightenment and a historic and selfancy neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "to mark the most violent place in Brazil," according to CecÃ­lia is false: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">In addition to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, is emphasised, in addition to CecÃ­lia, the State Policy of State's security policy has been repeated for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these uncertainty measures, the establishment of UPP (Univerde de PolÃ­ce Anficadora), one of the Great Depression, whose goal is to conquer the goal of a massive police building a Favela and to be stationed permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At first this led to a decline of violent deaths. for some years, UPP was supposed to protect the UPP after several reports about chicans and repression against the poor communities, who would need to protect the curious police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explained why the Violence in Rio did not comply with the defined criteria defined by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio has also a serious consequences for mankind.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state to use means and ways, which are typical for war. this includes the penetrating in the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and to object for "collateral damage" and "veraging balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War to or out, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas will continue to be in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="2833">On 21 October, several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal and claimed justice for the victims of fires that took place in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two and forty people died and approximately 70 injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for a period of 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that were spread out in northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and many villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June there was a similar tragedy in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande in June, where fires are 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European Forestry management system, which the forest areas are monitored by satellite recordings, in 2017 there are approximately 500,000 acres of forest in Portugal - an area of the size of Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">With that you can make you a better picture of the Ernst of Situation: there's no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral from the Federation of the farmers from Portugal declared the newspaper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did so nowhere: there are dozens of open parts of open roads which were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could happen again in June, since the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, construction permits in furnaces with a high school of Brandrisiko are asking.</seg>
<seg id="2852">An advanced suggestion to the Walloon form, which brought the government after serious fires between 2003 and 2005, was founded by communists, which saw the new rules as obstacle for investment.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The Quercus organisation set attention to attention that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly burning wood, like in a Teufelskimis, after fires of this species always wider.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems comes the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when residents were seeking or attempted to contact them offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: you used the own civil data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time over the site and spread of the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in the autumn of 1994, Afghanistan's conquest began through the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war between the various Mujahedin group had broken out which survived the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At this time, Asharaf Barati was a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghan in the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say then, she knew that she could not see her son much longer - perhaps even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">The boy had to break in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would bring him back, and bring him to the locks.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat was just assassinated by the Taliban, and many Hazara felt suddenly protection.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban fighters known for their hatred on Hazara's Taliban were ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a cohership for a few years. the work was difficult and made it sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took the thing that was left out of its low wages and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and stopped sacks with mortars, heavier than he himself, in order to make his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, life Afghan refugees fell by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard, reminded Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site at which we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we suspended nylon before the open window, so that we did not tumult at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The dangerous crossing on the sea suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum request, Asharaf returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf's homeless, went alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that divided twice the day of Essen in need of aid.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy remains a second chance for asylum seekers thanks to relatively high levels of asylum seekers. however, it's true that the terms and conditions apply to asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization Civil LibertUnion for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." they are improvised by improvised facilities in the hands of unskilled personnel and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center if they have formally applied for asylum - which can still be applied for months after the registration of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for a accommodation, either to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So also Asharaf also came.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his undisturbing lifetime helped Asharaf to free from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years in construction in construction industry for several years, Asharaf finished his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while still a time.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the "handicd Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - an Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
