that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he most spectacular , that the N@@ SA have heard illeg@@ ally teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
it describes the cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence service , in which the CIA signed Iran literally dra@@ fted proposals for a nuclear @-@ bomb .
if that doesn &apos;t sound , please read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know who did not know the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the Government established against R@@ isen and ur@@ ged him to call his alleged sources .
in that train , he became a symbol of the government of the government of W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and sentenced to journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this law , if media do not get this information and if they don &apos;t protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen .
so when the government had ank@@ le thought , he did something , what many cour@@ age@@ ous re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 he lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they had so many years , it had been indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to cr@@ ises .
the reason : in the time electronic monitoring , re@@ porter and sources can always hide themselves .
rather than to fail sil@@ ently and ra@@ isen , this could also do its digital foot@@ steps for it .
and so the investig@@ ator , without his in@@ compreh@@ ension , has been concerned , his telephone convers@@ ations ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ kin@@ as , its lending information , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
among these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and tear @-@ free spring .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government has a lot of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about National Security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
so we set the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government always has more possibilities to illumin@@ ate all .
but the same as technology the government permits to handle the rights of rep@@ aid , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact it from the moment , in which they receive contact , instead of in after@@ no@@ ons , in the testimony .
today there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen his book , and it is considerably more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source file system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the website of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , which has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation today , where I have been working intensi@@ vely .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go on a news website , as is the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , like in any common contact form .
these will be encrypted and stored on a server which only has the relevant news agency access .
so the government can &apos;t commit more information about it , and many of the information that would like to request would not be available by default .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the Press Freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments develop all over the world to develop new sp@@ ying @-@ technologies that all end@@ anger@@ ed .
it is to ensure that not only technology members such as Edward Snow@@ den has a opportunity to give iniquities . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower level .
the over mis@@ si@@ sts in the supply of soldiers would know and reported by over@@ crow@@ ding hospitals . or the next environment worker , the alarm to se@@ duc@@ ted water of Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ onia @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
these technologies have not only been taken for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitu@@ ent rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that the rich and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; must be hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to find a statement . &#93; this week we were sent by messages via a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm of the law firm of the ... &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as Mos@@ o Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you setup ? &quot;
indeed , we really see the e @-@ mails , how the entire system works , how it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has step@@ ped down .
there is also reports that a prohib@@ its of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad station@@ ery companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads through a close friend of children &apos;s days , one famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , waiting for the next release , and to the next reveal documents .
it sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John Gr@@ ish@@ am novel .
it appears from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we compare this ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax @-@ lambs and not all their taxes , then it means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these dis@@ appoint@@ ments are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax oils of some a few people will be used , their fortune to hide and swallowed up -- something we have been discus@@ sing and un@@ veil .
I think many people will appear this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how to work this tax .
I always present it like a Mat@@ ri@@ jo@@ sch@@ u@@ ger .
so , one company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , who &apos;s behind those fans .
it may be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and taxes , as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what matters .
I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this issue in the USA .
probably because there was no more famous Americans that were present in this revelation to this sc@@ and@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we have a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples in the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US States you need less information to provide less information to form a company than to receive a library certificate .
this type of in@@ transparent in the United States has allowed employees to rip school children &apos;s school children .
it has been permitted to gr@@ ate particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here &apos;s Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as afri@@ can minister , the susp@@ ects money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really sho@@ cked that all up to an advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ator make suggestions , how he could transfer his money .
these were all inci@@ dents . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course there was no money to be handed over . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it does not go to a single advoc@@ ate that led to our conce@@ aling investig@@ ator proposals .
it is not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al sc@@ and@@ al .
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty , and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules .
we have to change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound all very good , as if we could not do anything , if nothing ever changed , as if it &apos;s always the rich and powerful .
but as a recovered optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun .
in the last few years we have seen supplies to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject was based on political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU broad@@ casts into central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind firms in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US hin@@ ts here .
representatives of both parties signed a bill in both parliamentary groups , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama dis@@ closures , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for our Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are w@@ anting to see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
we need managers in the economy , standing up and say : &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who know the problem and use it to end the laws of the in@@ transparent .
together we can finally finish the In@@ transparency , which is now possible to end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story as I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk room of a red Maz@@ das landed .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sales .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . then he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing yet worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot space !
then I heard me : &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Ah , how to please ? &quot;
in the night I moved to the ceiling , I went to the ceiling and said : &quot; Oh man ! what have I been ro@@ cked to me ?
there is a wild living in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of the bed on the door of the door , and shut up my bedroom door .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me today is on his class@@ room today . he is now teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were only waiting for you to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I went to San Francisco I took the air mattress with the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am jo@@ bless , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates go out and the rent will be increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think , creativity can do it , anxi@@ ety in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have survived , as we could make something to make . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can sleep with us , WLAN and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded the air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ mat@@ ri@@ ze on wood floors .
they found it super , and we also .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et tast@@ es completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the whole city . when we came to our last guest and fell into the castle , then Brian and I passed away .
we &apos;ve just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time ?
things were going to roll .
my former fellow , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , public pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you come over .
on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the miss@@ ile would be ign@@ ited .
but they did not do .
no one who is yet with comfort would invest in a business that is not allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you should think of things that can be good . we were designed to design .
at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to create objects , but now we wanted to create great trust by design which had never before .
can design work so anything ?
is it possible to create design with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree of confidence we cont@@ ested .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up , when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to inform you that you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone with your left seat .
this silent suit of pan@@ ic you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when she open the first time .
for the only thing as your mobile phone is , your home is home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
you can also feel the most guests , if they may stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like this , who actually has Al Go@@ al cell phone ?
could you declare on Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had just presented itself with his name , if he would have told what he comes , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you had 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would return your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ made feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative impact distribution .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their courses before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people depend on each other , depending on how they are similar to age and residence .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly , we trust the people most likely to do most .
the more difference we find , the less we trust .
that is a natural social bias towards it .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation to the simil@@ ar@@ ities of simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots .
in addition , we proce@@ eded that confidence is dependent on how much one is reas@@ on@@ ably priced .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if one tells you , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
one tells you too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- will not be accepted on request .
so there is an optimum degree of open@@ ness , such as &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how to make it possible with design to make this degree of Open@@ ness ?
we use the size of text to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics one should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome all supplies from strangers .
with which we had not counted , the great amount of people who were more than ready to submit this preliminary parts .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that has not been bred before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are times even if not smoothly running .
there were guests who have been un@@ allowed parties and have been devast@@ ated .
hosts will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I got in the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is already wo@@ e when I think only about it .
the dis@@ appointment we hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will continue to be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fra@@ ction of 123 million people had a problem .
because people confi@@ ded to one another .
when confidence is working , miracles can be created .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay , where he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts went to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and is equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know anything .
you drive one in your own car in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books .
you can even stay longer without charge the Extra nights .
I only recommend it ! &quot;
this is not true , of course not any stay .
but this relations behind the pure money @-@ trans@@ missions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I came to the first time about this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of the particle bund@@ led with money transactions ?
it &apos;s here around a economic trade .
but it just &apos;s just &quot; rental term &quot; to name , the thing is not just .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
humans place one part of itself , and that changes everything .
when you travel in nowadays it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would it be if travelling a rich buffet from local influences ?
what if in every place , one visits to wait for a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and take one of a bar @-@ pent@@ our quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments of reason to split close ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thoughts from common share ?
I set up cities which enable us to support society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and am@@ us@@ ement .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . lots of parking places which belonged to the government ,
residents were offered now . students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay ,
by humans , their children were taken out . incub@@ ators were started ,
to finance new start@@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be participating in 191 countries by a stranger or own hosts .
the idea seems to be not so crazy about how it was attached to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were similar sites to us .
why so did our work work ?
apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep root parts .
I think that bl@@ ossom ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to re@@ think about it when a red Maz@@ da de@@ parts at me .
we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I ask myself why we can use the design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a faithful ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a female dog ?
or simply a delay for security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent , that will look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean most would not know any Muslims .
people do not speak with their predecess@@ ors .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coff@@ e@@ alog@@ ist -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am going to be mo@@ cked ,
a se@@ duc@@ tive fitness fan@@ ati@@ cian ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head discovery .
my femin@@ ist friends was horri@@ fied : &quot; why did you op@@ pressed yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ le was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , namely against the print I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and ri@@ cher beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents .
I got with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought I thought in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was faith@@ fully and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en them with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm will sometimes bring me to the weeping .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feeling the feeling that som@@ ebody takes you to perc@@ eive you completely , and somehow loves ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and started how all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the reason the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably recall exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , looked at the end of it , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ now@@ &apos; .
there was smoke , air@@ crafts used in buildings , people sp@@ ans from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into indig@@ nation quickly .
why should I do so anything ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not just my own country , but in the N@@ u turned me up the acts of others of a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new town and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember as I knew -- as we were silent -- so deep it went on my seat , and I feared the first time when it was recognized for the first time .
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard , I read and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations which said : &quot; are watching , &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week of inside .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered to prayer .
and again , war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
the feelings were mir@@ ro@@ red , and I heard also of attacks on Muslims , or of people whom they held for Muslims , in the free cr@@ ushed and stroke .
there was really surf mot@@ ions on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this land have attacked our country .
I lost the rage of people at the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain himself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
presently , we can say people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims , Muslims , and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my municipality as from a tum@@ ours in the body of the USA .
it only represents the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumour was removed as a whole and a good tumor is just under observation .
the alternatives are sin@@ less because the question is unt@@ rue .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ ours in the body of the US but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ery@@ hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ ad .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America secure ?
there will perhaps be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
regular visit to a mosque is to see people of other faith toler@@ ant , and larger bourgeoisie participation .
and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people will actually be radic@@ alised in Mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
during the etching process , it has found that it begins online . as the most important person , the person concerned may make a brain wear , that the person may believe that the person , the terror@@ ists are ab@@ h@@ ors the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology is un@@ tra@@ ded or fallen by faith .
if we want to prevent Radi@@ c@@ alisation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still asser@@ ted that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group as the IS makes its breeding with the Kor@@ an .
as a mother , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would then add to their predi@@ ctions if you recogni@@ zes it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS so much to do with Islam , such as K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ide@@ ology grounds on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you cast a look at them , they do not drive what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is its ne@@ sting , which they can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am telling me a surprising story :
a girl came to him , because they advanced to the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leader .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit that she had spoken , brought her to silence , and told her , that her wrath , their mind for un@@ righteousness in the world , she would only bring her in trouble .
nothing inspired and something that would have given her job , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ ization by extrem@@ ists who promised you a solution .
this Im@@ am posed the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use for their anger , he showed their constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS .
that was an insight , as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it counter@@ act as a normal US ?
how does it work on every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy on our thought of freedom ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : if we fear , there will happen at least three things .
we accept an author@@ itarian government system , Con@@ formity and supplies .
a study shows : if you report Test@@ ers messages , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
that is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims on the above were -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the preparation of the war , and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it may actually be a tool to manip@@ ulate the public to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society , sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we feel like first , but the tox@@ ic@@ ical air of fear makes us all of us .
in the assignment of collective education , it is not only possible to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married pair that lived in M@@ ays Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was very promising at the Department of dental , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most common , most generous person , whom they knew .
she visited him and he showed her life . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when has become of my breasts such a di@@ versi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit from Su@@ z@@ anne , her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered them , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had posted in the afternoon , as in an execution , after he posted a post@@ age due to Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be a mor@@ dial , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or remained safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it went on to leave the United States to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we chose us for the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s residence we drove in silence , with high pressure at the mosque .
I took him out of my shoes , went into the hall , and what I saw , he left me .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Im@@ am made a announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who were come , not to attack us , but for us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they have courage and tri@@ gu@@ ous pan@@ ic and alleg@@ ory .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to go on numbers ?
or you will connect to those who believe : we are better than the one .
many thanks .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what you say that you might say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a reas@@ oning with deep step , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually come as it is permitted .
if you look for Muslims in the whole world , and I did so with the largest ever conducted study to Muslims on the whole world , people want normal things .
they want a prosper@@ ity to the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so , there is no exception in any ways .
if people appear as a rule , then the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , one fell down .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . this is made possible in research institutes worldwide .
before the air @-@ package contract entered into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft engines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France was built directly in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 brick . some years ago , they began to fly with lines .
achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest possible areas through joining them .
you can also build self @-@ free res@@ ili@@ ent structures .
you have learned to take loads to react to a tur@@ bul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in autonomous flight .
in order to run a system , it must know collec@@ tively know where the mobile objects are located in the area .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic tasks .
we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available in the highest e . e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
one flying , tried to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the strong wings , it can be pi@@ g , and thus has great benefits when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a flip side .
a limitation of rear doors is that it react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ bul@@ ence such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter what the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved through practice .
okay .
throughout our research we often present fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rating the core of the case .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question .
Hel@@ icop@@ ters are about machines with a thousand moving parts known to viol@@ ate them .
in recent decades , pilots could fly remote control devices , which had only two movable parts : one propeller and a tail@@ gate .
long ago we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically non @-@ sim@@ pl@@ est flight machine . it was invented in front of recently .
it only has an event@@ ful part , one propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse plates , no further slot or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechanically simple , in the interior happens very much , so that it can fly stable , and can move in space over@@ ly .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern . to fly to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability to throw it right , if all of you look on it is low , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in gen@@ itals , this machine is here , the one with his eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is equivalent to ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
as a result he receives the awarded ability ,
moving into space in all directions , no matter what it is turned on or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is obvious in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly to fly .
let &apos;s see this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin propeller aircraft engines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise .
and the other side counter@@ clock@@ wise .
if you build it , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a little low -- a engine or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine even if necessary .
we will now demonstrate that we make a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we participated commerci@@ ally micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alized technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where space is and self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , you &apos;re motiv@@ ating these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine , on Broadway you want to become a flying lamp screen at Broadway .
of course it is hard to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it permits to create stories , allowing them to form as spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential , the t@@ ittle is on the i .
many thanks .
in a very far distant galax@@ y 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes are becoming faster than in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three n@@ uns in one tenth seconds in pure energy .
this short moment they ligh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very great Kn@@ all .
but they were not able to use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time encoder itself and the Uni@@ verse explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago had just been the world &apos;s life on earth .
since then the earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God understand us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly mud -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people knew her as a mad Gen@@ ies so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , concept and extremely har@@ lot of hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer - Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of L@@ IG@@ O increased significantly , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some minor problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ fied black holes fired through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically , the fruits of my life .
all this , what I worked , is not longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts of black holes and their ob@@ serv@@ atories such as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals since 23 years . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation shaft is an or@@ us@@ ement in the area of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched onto the direction and to the other .
to illustr@@ ate care@@ ers in courses of rel@@ ativity on the theory of rel@@ ativity was often a real dance on .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us stretched out the waves of the waves , the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1st anniversary you declared the L@@ IG@@ O staff for mad .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length should be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nuclear weapon . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text by grav@@ itation
the K@@ IP Thor@@ ens described a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the way as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such detectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ nish and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims , L@@ IG@@ O be more an ear as an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : visual fields , the size of your mobile phone .
that &apos;s quite practical . because you can create a picture or map of things by making the light around you around .
with k@@ ite , that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult to produce a picture of things which makes you very much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as clay layer and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice &quot; is talking about Alice .
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob &quot; .
the same is true for gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts .
we can do with them any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by looking for changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to the stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are measured for L@@ IG@@ O measured in the audi@@ ble range .
when we can convert wave pattern in Sh@@ all , we can listen to all literally .
the grav@@ itation can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes in which my colleague Scott has been very long employed .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , Cir@@ cles simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circulation with an additional audio change . that &apos;s like this way : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a type of motion detector , shaped into the shaft shape .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - heard L@@ IG@@ O the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the Ger@@ sh@@ y &#93; : &#91; Sur@@ render of T@@ SH : ... two black holes with 30 times of solar mass , which are about as fast as the st@@ aves of your mixer .
AA : consider us short , which means that this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 tons , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , the other one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic . fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
it remains the remaining importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aving a completely new way to explore the universe as they never before .
on this road we can listen to all and the invisible .
in all , we can not see any much in all - convenient or basically - not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ iller @-@ stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the All .
the exciting physical processes are done in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of iron , as it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the jung@@ le is covered by his own offspring .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic , that all things exist , which we have never seen that we never see and of which we have no idea , we only have to discover , that we listen .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O found the first round of things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars that yields black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so called the sau@@ erk@@ raut for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to view a completely different viewing angle to the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of that chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as good as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and the cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a completely new generation of ob@@ serv@@ atories on the earth and all .
for what could be better than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for a year I would say anything &quot; Yes ! &quot; say , I was afraid of that .
no matter whether it made me nervous , I brought me into un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing with the swing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that thing , when I was afraid , my fear fell .
my fear , spe@@ ech@@ es to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the Power of a Word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my youngest ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Klein@@ ste , calls for un@@ explained reasons , &quot;
as it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my be@@ um@@ bil@@ ical asses . &quot;
she once asked me how I could play with her when I just was on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life @-@ setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars myself to play with them as soon as you do with me . no matter what I am doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I tired of it very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : just before short , I actually understood that &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ ages I saved my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out of , I raised up life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I had television .
I am TV , in big style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for this to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television sen@@ ders can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode , all nine days , four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows that are simultaneously in production , four episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how to get A@@ way With rod , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run succession on Thursday night .
in all over the world , my series production runs in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments which I have created self , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sc@@ end@@ our . I must find time , really silent , creative time to tell my fans to assemble the camp@@ fires and my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who makes it yet ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I tell you , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you have a company , a country or a class@@ room to take care of work , so that I say not only at the computer gets you , and it &apos;s right when I say : I understand that there is not an dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;ve been deep@@ ened in the job , there is no other feeling .
my labour always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s when I set troops back when I painted on a canvas .
so as a dream one gets a high sound , lie@@ fs a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanically , hard and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous , fun and mat@@ er@@ nal , clin@@ ically and reasonable , cruel , and sen@@ sible . and the best to it , the sum@@ s is .
there &apos;s such a change in me when the job runs well .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could always go on it for ever .
many people assume , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I talk , that the writing is prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does .
but the sum@@ s -- as I began to work and work together with the TV production , when I began to work and work together , I discovered this thing to create this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have so a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t take it different than size .
the feeling of feeling not differently , whether to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means to be a workflow .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I did not make for the failure , and I know only that I love the bu@@ zz .
I only want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask in question .
to make a clear thing : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more crow@@ ded limits , the more work there , the more things in the same time , the more do I write to history so more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s that sum@@ s sum@@ s to sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , infl@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters were acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estimates that I &apos;d like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine collap@@ sed .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours day , solid weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan ,
all was grey , I had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what if you do , what you do , the work that you love , suddenly bear witness ?
I know , some like that : &quot; bring you out , ha@@ ze the author of Titan . &quot;
but you know what you &apos;re doing , you are doing what you &apos;re doing , one teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you love one another , and that feels like the sum@@ s , if you knew the sum@@ s , if the sum@@ s seems to stop , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stop , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South @-@ States @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress will show me a question . &quot;
I am on the way back , too late and she says : &apos; m@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to tell no more than two things that are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to all , and second , she called me not &quot; iter@@ ations . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estim@@ ations . &quot;
when is that happen ?
I p@@ asse it if I &apos;m using Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama is you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we &apos;re playing and their sisters encounter with us , we laugh much and I read the very dramatic coming from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum@@ s , I can &apos;t do anything , except them .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they do not exist anymore .
everything exists , st@@ icky fingers and wet k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , juni@@ ors , and song , in which it will be let &apos;s go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen leaves . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simp@@ licity .
the air in this place is so barely that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I am at home .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
an investment door goes to and an energy converter comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly because it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium pad , that &apos;s only the replacement .
if I ask you , you are if I say you , if I have cast me out using ship@@ ments and TV hours and how to function my brain , I forgot what is the real sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream , which comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is Self @-@ Cons@@ ci@@ ousness and Peace .
the real sum@@ s are igno@@ red the pressure of the history , to do the tasks , the expect@@ ation and the pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is the voice of God in my ear , but perhaps you whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my son wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I make it a solid rule , so that I can rid of them as a workflow of any gu@@ ilt .
it is a law , I have no other choice . I have no other option if I want to hear the sum@@ s .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not an@@ sat@@ er@@ p@@ ise to play as long as you work .
the truth does wo@@ e ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I rather than home at the workplace .
this conf@@ ession is painful , because what a man does better works than being a home ?
well , yes , I .
to be hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titanium . --
I have to have problems .
that I am too la@@ zy , one of them .
we look around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we grin@@ der soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff@@ ed , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always take hold on my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play until I ask : why did we ever hear with playing ?
you can also say it ! if your child would like to play with you .
you might hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
since you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me maximum 15 minutes , until they have tast@@ ed that they want to do something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Lady be@@ et@@ le or bis@@ cuit will be replaced .
and my teen@@ ager @-@ daughter spent all 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , there is no need for it .
each one can get 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ stop @-@ day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no rush .
the day is short : dinner , the children were finished .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my wellness , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for their soul fri@@ eden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to get the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
get out the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail@@ es and I will . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not get full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without playing .
it needs time , but after a few months Open a door opens , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she fills me and my soul . you desp@@ ise me to new ideas . I use it back in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I love it not .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s are not I ... no more .
bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grat@@ eful for that .
it &apos;s good to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play anymore .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still functional . my storage life is still burning .
the more I play , the more than@@ k@@ ful I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better work I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country I run , the marathon , I run , the screens , the fl@@ ax , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , un@@ stable , nu@@ de and new feeling of living in me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things I raised you to life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play anymore .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ ing .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedy .
I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a severe stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low ability to take self @-@ healing .
after a severe infr@@ in@@ gement of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor , trying to improve the nerve function by various surgical measures .
they certainly have one of the best known ones , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation , &quot; thus im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons that improves neuro@@ logic function .
it is truly amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that have suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation yet does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
we come to this dream for my opinion .
I want to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior leader and working day and night in the emergency .
I often supplied patients with skull brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain trau@@ mat@@ a brain trau@@ mat@@ a stim@@ ulates the brain and the cran@@ k@@ in pressure .
to save life , one must decrease the Sk@@ ull of the skull .
therefore we have to remove a s@@ wollen s@@ ni@@ b mass sometimes .
instead of the s@@ wollen har@@ sh mass , we decided to analyze Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , a biolog@@ ist of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist who analy@@ sing the brain compound .
what will I do with this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
that is not a light task .
cells origin@@ ate from one tissue piece , comparable to small children who are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve it .
just that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed to make Jean François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like as a master cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may still know from the bi@@ ological lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep and small zer@@ oes .
it is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very rapid .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but looked differently .
we needed long to understand whence they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells of hot Dou@@ b@@ ble@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain tissue cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of F@@ öt@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why did they get to us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find in higher concentrations close to brain injury .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source that permits brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain compound from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells just cultivated as it did Jean @-@ François
and it will mark on colour to track it in the brain .
in the final step , we im@@ planted them on the occasion of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ etic Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in cer@@ ated brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been taken down completely after a few weeks , they would have been taken back home . the room is already busy , they will not need there , so van@@ ish them .
in the second scenario , we added an injury to and im@@ planted the same cells and now kept the cells - they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were im@@ planted .
the proof they show them are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro , coloured in the culture .
we could not stop here .
help those cells are necessary to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual bl@@ ending task .
they had to take fe@@ ather of a tray .
they did very well .
when they achieved a stabil@@ ized dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we witnessed the motor@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex @-@ motor@@ ized area in the motor@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex area .
subsequently the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hands anymore .
exactly as it would happen with people , they recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechan@@ isms . they recover a certain degree like in the monkey .
as we were certain that the monkey achieved his degree of spontan@@ eous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side they see the monkey , which recovered spontan@@ e@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
well , when we im@@ planted the cells , the same monkey , two months after im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that they were very exciting results .
since that time we found out much more about these cells .
we can freeze it freezing and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still being im@@ planted with people .
I really hope to show you soon as we can show you the human brain &apos;s means to heal himself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who can need this . &quot;
I definitely at any case .
of course , the question of what are the greatest obstacles before completing clinical trials .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : take a look into the future -- You have completed the research and tried permission to start clinical trials . if you see further in the future , how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then , one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to do and evaluate treatments , if it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , one has to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you must first actually prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and sure it is , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and you have told us of it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we make a major mistake in the West as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider that they are un@@ altered .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neigh@@ bor in Beijing proved that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while the politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy come with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ lied Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group - that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect the savings programs which were implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better rec@@ ess for Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my coming friends who would repeat me if they could change anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to believe in together with me , that Lee ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
because without democracy , our societies are painted to face our future dark and spectacular , new technologies .
to the topic of waste I would like to refer to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently our host rock is threatened .
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ins summit par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Scho@@ den@@ berg , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe , and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
but only few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to in@@ ev@@ itable savings and corpor@@ ations , however , could invest there , where it could be productive and income , with whom one might produce productive mountain and also to produce all the things that humanity are ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , a total of 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the US , England and in the euro zone , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial machines , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars currently sounds as much money until they were compared with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to spread apart from the stock and property prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital make the twin summit which are not covered by common market mechanisms by common market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently , a low demand advoc@@ ates that they could not invest in which they could not invest in which they could kill him , that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances which leads to it , that Ö@@ th@@ fulness k@@ ills him .
that is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its extremely f@@ ical art . All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents , and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed : what do we understand ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the society type , control the free and the poor as a majority to the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy decided of course too many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the job value of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these incl@@ usions .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and that she did not only agree with the working arms , but are not just the right to free expression , but important and crucial that they gave them the right to political participation with equal bal@@ dness in questions of the State Coun@@ ts .
indeed , the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was not held long --
like a candle that sh@@ in@@ ates very bright , it is quickly spread quickly .
however , our today &apos;s liber@@ als did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling party .
for the liberal democracy came only on when a full separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was abolished in politics as the economy -- so the world of the corpor@@ ations - a demo@@ c@@ rati@@ e@@ free zone .
in our today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time of which the separation between politics and economics began , a her@@ ed@@ itary struggle between the two continued , and the economy gradually de@@ stru@@ cted the politics .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it lies in mind that today it can be in the government but nevertheless not in power , because the power of the policies were di@@ spar@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated .
I also mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of smo@@ kers which nour@@ ishes the animals as sustain@@ ably the animals , that they are nour@@ ished , so that they are star@@ red at the end .
it is similar to the economy that radic@@ alised the policy so far , that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , political property is increasing , the overall economic demand is falling and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to invest , the cash of its company is to invest .
the majority of capitalism is selling the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher will the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human strength and prosper@@ ity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t strange .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only achieve a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of breeding and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing , by replacing low @-@ money employees by automation and rob@@ otic .
the problem of this problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , and social conflicts greater , as it is - already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
we have to combine the economy and to un@@ ite the fields of business and politics , and care that we democr@@ atically replace the re@@ united sphere , otherwise we end up in a disease hyper@@ auto@@ cl@@ an , which can appear to the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
so the question isn &apos;t whether capitalism is brought to the technical achievements , that it will survive --
the most interesting question is whether to be super@@ se@@ ded by a D@@ yst@@ er@@ ie , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the society enters into &quot; Star Trek , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians , &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ er@@ ie ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples soon .
in the field of companies : please make a capital market , in which one deser@@ ves money while you are working and where your funds will be within you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one operates just -- is the property of them working in the company .
then all income from capital and out@@ comes and the concept of wage labour is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction more between those who belong to the company but they are not working there , but employees who work there , but no diving more between capital and work , no big g@@ aps between investment and shar@@ ks , and ultimately does not have any standing twin summit .
in the field of global political economy : please explain shortly before our national currencies had a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all human@@ kind .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency , we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading income of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment is ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not possible to implement the technical means .
today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united policy and economy .
the world that I cast you is at the same time that they are privileged people , and mar@@ x@@ istic as they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we awak@@ ening in such a world
or are we going to be sin@@ king into a matrix ? - similar d@@ yst@@ cy@@ ie ?
the answer depends on how we decide to choose polit@@ ically .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we do it even better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you defend yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of these crisis of a part of the earth to the next , as we see it , it will not only be able to dest@@ abil@@ ise our democracy , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely effective .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you are not effective , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophy -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned in Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you have from the view of the West to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our Liber@@ al democracy we have a guarantee of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy does , -- a completely demo@@ c@@ rati@@ e@@ free zone .
in a certain respec@@ ts , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative may China is similar to China today the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect Liber@@ alism to democracy -- that is an error , historically regarded as an error .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what can be seen in China , very similar to the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China to act now to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Hell@@ as at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I think that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal visibility , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the self @-@ ability of goo@@ db@@ ye , and den@@ ying that a massive donation is passed through the Eurozone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity to open the first proposal on the basis of the Greek Vor@@ bis -- by the way that den@@ ying this den@@ ial --
it right to make it right . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the Euro Area , continues to den@@ ial .
but you know , what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try a economic system that is not over@@ wearing due to political will and auth@@ ori@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it will perhaps be possible for a while , but if then the change happens , it happens to ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroy .
BG : what ways are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you make any mist@@ akes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back - serious ...
if there is a finance minister , or there is any minister after 6 months in office , especially in such a cl@@ amped situation , claiming that he did not make any mist@@ akes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I did mist@@ akes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the school program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest in pages of the money , to find a common solution .
but this was not .
they just wanted to bring out our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distortion caused by the eu@@ ro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to understand that they had a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
that is worse than the great depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the money that has raised us this policy , &quot; was a col@@ oss@@ y mistake . &quot;
BG : in spite of all that , and despite the aggressive tone of convers@@ ations , it seems to be even better per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my critic@@ isms of the European Union and the eu@@ ro@@ zone opposite to anyone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they survived , the released fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe but for the whole world economy .
we probably are the strongest economy in the world .
if we introduce ourselves to the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , then it appears to be well also for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you for you were with T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
von Roy &apos; never heard most of it , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your lifetime on 19th April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision by breaking the Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is the executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , lean and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the contents of the Amazon .
of course , it is a very hard round industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy can not choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , it must find shows that are located right on the right side .
this turn is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that , after you see a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that &apos;s enough to tell you what about this end of the turn .
Roy Price does not expect to come on the left side of the turn , because I think it takes special intelligence in order to under@@ cut &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
it turns out more thoughts about the average rec@@ ess , the average television , the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they just in@@ spire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s also the first time that Amazon makes something something like Roy &apos;s nothing risks .
he wants to create success .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses the first episode of TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch them free of charge .
and if Amazon is in vain for something , do you feel right ?
millions of spectators look at this episodes .
however , they know not that they are observed when looking at this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team , who can record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ auses , which parts can be ski@@ pped or checked again .
you collect millions of data to decide on these data you should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , process and process the reply , and this is the answer : &quot; Amazon was able to make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US broadcast . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many things can remember that show , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average , but not just what Roy and his team worked out .
at the same time , another managers have placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for a super @-@ show , and it also uses the data , but it makes it a bit different .
rather than holding a competition , he and his team st@@ owed the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ator , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a car and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four trans@@ formers , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; receives a 9.1 @-@ rating on this turn . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , is the question : what has happened here ?
one has two very compet@@ iti@@ ves , data @-@ di@@ versi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because logic imp@@ lies that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that is met , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistic for back @-@ up .
it is optimized for very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not functioning , then this is something fri@@ gh@@ tening because we live in a time , in which we have more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one has ever comes in contact with this software . come in contact with this software , you are in prison .
if som@@ ebody asks in the US in prison and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like on Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . instead of to decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person is good or bad .
median television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis is , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . that &apos;s not what a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data and most experienced firms are actually wrong .
yes , even Google does not make mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to predi@@ ct out data analysis of influenza , its worst manner , -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news : the success was cul@@ min@@ ated in a release in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the result of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data under@@ run companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes do something .
despite all of these errors , data leads to the decisions of life -- at the workplace , at the right of legal , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ supported genet@@ ics -- an area where some very smart people can benefit un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ sem@@ inated .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , do mostly do two things :
the most important place of this problem in its single parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , set the individual parts again to deal with a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and assemble them again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ man@@ tle the problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
but there is another tool and we own it all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , parts and pieces can be merged again , even if the information is incomplete , especially if the brain is an expert .
therefore I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they are data and understanding , where they are also involved in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else could it be capable of . but the decision how to put all these parts again and makes it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not understood in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things work down when data are going to start our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will become ...
before going on , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions with a J@@ a- or No @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will then wi@@ pe it later with a technique demo .
I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life so far . I could listen to the ball in the after@@ no@@ ons .
but , just as you know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in that way , perhaps the ball cl@@ ü@@ ger and cle@@ ver and cle@@ ver . finally , it is approaching us to make decisions when we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right curve .
and I guess it as very encour@@ aging news that it is still paying in spite of the great amount of data always paid out to make decisions to be an expert in that which you do , and risks involved .
by the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
