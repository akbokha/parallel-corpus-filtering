<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he most spectacular, that the NSA have heard illegally telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes the catastrophic US intelligence service, in which the CIA signed Iran literally drafted proposals for a nuclear-bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that doesn't sound, please read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who did not know the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the Government established against Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In that train, he became a symbol of the government of the government of Whistleblower and sentenced to journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this law, if media do not get this information and if they don't protect the identity of the Mutigen.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government had ankle thought, he did something, what many courageous reporters did before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 he lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had so many years, it had been indispensable for their case, the government's demands were dropped to crises.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time electronic monitoring, reporter and sources can always hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail silently and raisen, this could also do its digital footsteps for it.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without his incomprehension, has been concerned, his telephone conversations,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and bankinas, its lending information, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and tear-free spring.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government has a lot of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about National Security was the result of that a Whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government always has more possibilities to illuminate all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But the same as technology the government permits to handle the rights of repaid, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact it from the moment, in which they receive contact, instead of in afternoons, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen his book, and it is considerably more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source file system for Whistleblower, originally developed by the website of Aaron Swartz, which has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation today, where I have been working intensively.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go on a news website, as is the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, like in any common contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and stored on a server which only has the relevant news agency access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can't commit more information about it, and many of the information that would like to request would not be available by default.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the Press Freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments develop all over the world to develop new spying-technologies that all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to ensure that not only technology members such as Edward Snowden has a opportunity to give iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower level.</seg>
<seg id="39">The over missists in the supply of soldiers would know and reported by overcrowding hospitals. or the next environment worker, the alarm to seducted water of Flint. or a Wallonia-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">These technologies have not only been taken for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constituent rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leck of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that the rich and Mighty] must be hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to find a statement.] this week we were sent by messages via a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm of the law firm of the...]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers have to go to companies such as Moso Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you setup?"</seg>
<seg id="45">Indeed, we really see the e-mails, how the entire system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that a prohibits of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad stationery companies in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads through a close friend of children's days, one famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, waiting for the next release, and to the next reveal documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It appears from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we compare this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax-lambs and not all their taxes, then it means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these disappointments are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax oils of some a few people will be used, their fortune to hide and swallowed up -- something we have been discussing and unveil.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will appear this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how to work this tax.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matrijoschuger.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, who's behind those fans.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecutions and taxes, as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this issue in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there was no more famous Americans that were present in this revelation to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we have a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US States you need less information to provide less information to form a company than to receive a library certificate.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the United States has allowed employees to rip school children's school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been permitted to grate particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here's Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as african minister, the suspects money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked that all up to an advocate of our investigator make suggestions, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all incidents. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course there was no money to be handed over. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not go to a single advocate that led to our concealing investigator proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politiker, wrapped in a scandal scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound all very good, as if we could not do anything, if nothing ever changed, as if it's always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a recovered optimist, I see that some things have begun.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen supplies to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject was based on political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU broadcasts into central registers at national level, who is really behind firms in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US hints here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties signed a bill in both parliamentary groups, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosures, this huge insight into the world of tax havases, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For our Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are wanting to see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy, standing up and say: "intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who know the problem and use it to end the laws of the intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally finish the Intransparency, which is now possible to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I was almost abducted and in the trunk room of a red Mazdas landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a roadtrip through the whole country. then he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">As we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing yet worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Ah, how to please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I moved to the ceiling, I went to the ceiling and said: "Oh man! what have I been rocked to me?</seg>
<seg id="114">There is a wild living in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of the bed on the door of the door, and shut up my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me today is on his classroom today. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were only waiting for you to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I went to San Francisco I took the air mattress with the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am jobless, almost pleite, my roommates go out and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity can do it, anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have survived, as we could make something to make. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can sleep with us, WLAN and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded the air mattress and breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airmatrize on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-Omelet tastes completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the whole city. when we came to our last guest and fell into the castle, then Brian and I passed away.</seg>
<seg id="134">We've just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were going to roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a website, public pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you come over.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not do.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is yet with comfort would invest in a business that is not allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you should think of things that can be good. we were designed to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to create objects, but now we wanted to create great trust by design which had never before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design work so anything?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create design with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree of confidence we contested.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to inform you that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent suit of panic you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when she open the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing as your mobile phone is, your home is home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You can also feel the most guests, if they may stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like this, who actually has Al Goal cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had just presented itself with his name, if he would have told what he comes, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments that all say: "he can really hold very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would return your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-made feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative impact distribution.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their courses before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people depend on each other, depending on how they are similar to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most likely to do most.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more difference we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">That is a natural social bias towards it.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three divisions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation to the similarities of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we proceeded that confidence is dependent on how much one is reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells you, like "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells you too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- will not be accepted on request.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to make it possible with design to make this degree of Openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of text to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome all supplies from strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not counted, the great amount of people who were more than ready to submit this preliminary parts.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that has not been bred before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times even if not smoothly running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been unallowed parties and have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I got in the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is already woe when I think only about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment we hear in the voice of the callers, and will continue to be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of 123 million people had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people confided to one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence is working, miracles can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay, where he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts went to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and is equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know anything.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the Extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is not true, of course not any stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relations behind the pure money-transmissions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I came to the first time about this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of the particle bundled with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's here around a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just's just "rental term" to name, the thing is not just.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans place one part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel in nowadays it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would it be if travelling a rich buffet from local influences?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place, one visits to wait for a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and take one of a bar-pentour quarter, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments of reason to split close?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thoughts from common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I set up cities which enable us to support society and relations, instead of loneliness and amusement.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. lots of parking places which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Residents were offered now. students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">By humans, their children were taken out. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new startups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be participating in 191 countries by a stranger or own hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not so crazy about how it was attached to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why so did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep root parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that blossom,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to rethink about it when a red Mazda departs at me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I ask myself why we can use the design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a female dog?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay for security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent, that will look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">People do not speak with their predecessors.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffealogist -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am going to be mocked,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seductive fitness fanatician,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head discovery.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends was horrified: "why did you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustle was: at that time it was a feminist independence of independence, namely against the print I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and richer beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I got with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought I thought in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was faithfully and slow devotion to deepen them with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm will sometimes bring me to the weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feeling the feeling that somebody takes you to perceive you completely, and somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started how all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the reason the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably recall exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, looked at the end of it, looked upon the screen and saw the word "Eilnow'.</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts used in buildings, people spans from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so anything?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not just my own country, but in the Nu turned me up the acts of others of a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new town and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as I knew -- as we were silent -- so deep it went on my seat, and I feared the first time when it was recognized for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard, I read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said: "are watching," Be careful, "" Stay in well lit, "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week of inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw my extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were mirrored, and I heard also of attacks on Muslims, or of people whom they held for Muslims, in the free crushed and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really surf motions on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this land have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I lost the rage of people at the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Presently, we can say people: "there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims, Muslims, and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my municipality as from a tumours in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only represents the question: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumour was removed as a whole and a good tumor is just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are sinless because the question is untrue.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumours in the body of the US but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, eryhelpers and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will perhaps be a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque is to see people of other faith tolerant, and larger bourgeoisie participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people will actually be radicalised in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the etching process, it has found that it begins online. as the most important person, the person concerned may make a brain wear, that the person may believe that the person, the terrorists are abhors the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is untraded or fallen by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent Radicalisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still asserted that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group as the IS makes its breeding with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a mother, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would then add to their predictions if you recognizes it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS so much to do with Islam, such as Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology grounds on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you cast a look at them, they do not drive what they are in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its nesting, which they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam telling me a surprising story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they advanced to the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leader.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit that she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her, that her wrath, their mind for unrighteousness in the world, she would only bring her in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that would have given her job, she was a main goal for the instrumentization by extremists who promised you a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam posed the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it counteract as a normal US?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy on our thought of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: if we fear, there will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept an authoritarian government system, Conformity and supplies.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you report Testers messages, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">That is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims on the above were -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the preparation of the war, and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction on Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It may actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermining the foundation of a free society, sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We feel like first, but the toxicical air of fear makes us all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective education, it is not only possible to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married pair that lived in Mays Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was very promising at the Department of dental, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most common, most generous person, whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him and he showed her life. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has become of my breasts such a diversified young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit from Suzanne, her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had posted in the afternoon, as in an execution, after he posted a postage due to Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be a mordial, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or remained safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it went on to leave the United States to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose us for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's residence we drove in silence, with high pressure at the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out of my shoes, went into the hall, and what I saw, he left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made a announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who were come, not to attack us, but for us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they have courage and triguous panic and allegory.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of anxiety and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on numbers?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will connect to those who believe: we are better than the one.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a Nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say that you might say that you are a TEDTalk, a reasoning with deep step, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I usually come as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look for Muslims in the whole world, and I did so with the largest ever conducted study to Muslims on the whole world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want a prosperity to the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So, there is no exception in any ways.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, one fell down.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug. this is made possible in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air-package contract entered into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft engines in the Frac Centre in France was built directly in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 brick. some years ago, they began to fly with lines.</seg>
<seg id="410">Achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest possible areas through joining them.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-free resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to take loads to react to a turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to run a system, it must know collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the area.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">We use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available in the highest e. e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One flying, tried to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the strong wings, it can be pig, and thus has great benefits when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear doors is that it react sensitively to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter what the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">Throughout our research we often present fundamental abstract questions that penetrating the core of the case.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are about machines with a thousand moving parts known to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="434">In recent decades, pilots could fly remote control devices, which had only two movable parts: one propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Long ago we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically non-simplest flight machine. it was invented in front of recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has an eventful part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse plates, no further slot or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the interior happens very much, so that it can fly stable, and can move in space overly.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern. to fly to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it right, if all of you look on it is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is a exercise in genitals, this machine is here, the one with his eight propellers, a exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is equivalent to ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result he receives the awarded ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving into space in all directions, no matter what it is turned on or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is obvious in models, the rest is learns directly to fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other side counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you build it, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a little low -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine even if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated commercially micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localized technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you're motivating these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine, on Broadway you want to become a flying lamp screen at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is hard to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it permits to create stories, allowing them to form as spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential, the tittle is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">In a very far distant galaxy 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes are becoming faster than in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three nuns in one tenth seconds in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lightened brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they were not able to use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into the space-time encoder itself and the Universe exploded in gravitational shafts.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago had just been the world's life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God understand us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly mud -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector, to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew her as a mad Genies so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, concept and extremely harlot of hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser Interferometer - Gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time the precision of LIGO increased significantly, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collified black holes fired through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I worked, is not longer science fiction! AA: that's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational shafts of black holes and their observatories such as LIGO measurable signals since 23 years. but what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation shaft is an orusement in the area of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched onto the direction and to the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate careers in courses of relativity on the theory of relativity was often a real dance on.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us stretched out the waves of the waves, the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the Comma, followed by a 1st anniversary you declared the LIGO staff for mad.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured on less than a thousandth of a nuclear weapon. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text by gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">The KIP Thorens described a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the way as follows: "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finnish and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO be more an ear as an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: visual fields, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. because you can create a picture or map of things by making the light around you around.</seg>
<seg id="509">With kite, that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult to produce a picture of things which makes you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as clay layer and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice" is talking about Alice.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is true for gravitational shafts.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking for changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to the stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are measured for LIGO measured in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">When we can convert wave pattern in Shall, we can listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes in which my colleague Scott has been very long employed.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, Circles simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circulation with an additional audio change. that's like this way: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of motion detector, shaped into the shaft shape.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget - heard LIGO the following: [Surrender of the Gershy]: [Surrender of TSH:... two black holes with 30 times of solar mass, which are about as fast as the staves of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: consider us short, which means that this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 tons, the other with a mass of 36 suns, the other one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic. fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It remains the remaining importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paving a completely new way to explore the universe as they never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to all and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">In all, we can not see any much in all - convenient or basically - not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why miller-stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are done in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves of iron, as it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the jungle is covered by his own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic, that all things exist, which we have never seen that we never see and of which we have no idea, we only have to discover, that we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO found the first round of things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars that yields black holes, such as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so called the sauerkraut for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to view a completely different viewing angle to the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as good as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and the circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on the earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be better than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year I would say anything "Yes!" say, I was afraid of that.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, I brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes".</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to start playing with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that thing, when I was afraid, my fear fell.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The Power of a Word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life to an unexpectedly. it began with a question of my youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Kleinste, calls for unexplained reasons, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As it would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimation, I need milk for my beumbilical asses."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me how I could play with her when I just was on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life-setting in my family. from there I swears myself to play with them as soon as you do with me. no matter what I am doing, or whither I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I tired of it very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: just before short, I actually understood that "Yes" -Sages I saved my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out of, I raised up life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I had television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am TV, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for this to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television senders can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode, all nine days, four shows, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows that are simultaneously in production, four episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: how to get Away With rod, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run succession on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">In all over the world, my series production runs in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 these 70 TV hours are shipments which I have created self, and not only produced, so still obscendour. I must find time, really silent, creative time to tell my fans to assemble the campfires and my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes it yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell you, because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you have a company, a country or a classroom to take care of work, so that I say not only at the computer gets you, and it's right when I say: I understand that there is not an dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I've been deepened in the job, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My labour always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I set troops back when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as a dream one gets a high sound, liefs a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, hard and intoxicuous, fun and maternal, clinically and reasonable, cruel, and sensible. and the best to it, the sums is.</seg>
<seg id="613">There's such a change in me when the job runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could always go on it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I tell them the sums that I talk, that the writing is prepared for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I began to work and work together with the TV production, when I began to work and work together, I discovered this thing to create this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have so a sums, you can't take it different than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of feeling not differently, whether to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workflow.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I did not make for the failure, and I know only that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I only want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear thing: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more crowded limits, the more work there, the more things in the same time, the more do I write to history so more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums that sums sums to sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, inflated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters were accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimates that I'd like to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours day, solid weekends, no Reue, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">All was grey, I had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what if you do, what you do, the work that you love, suddenly bear witness?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some like that: "bring you out, haze the author of Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you're doing, you are doing what you're doing, one teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you love one another, and that feels like the sums, if you knew the sums, if the sums seems to stop, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stop, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-States-waitress will show me a question."</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way back, too late and she says: 'mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to tell no more than two things that are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all, and second, she called me not "iterations."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "estimations."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I passe it if I'm using Titan and my sums, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama is you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We're playing and their sisters encounter with us, we laugh much and I read the very dramatic coming from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sums, I can't do anything, except them.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything exists, sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, juniors, and song, in which it will be let's go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen leaves."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so barely that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am at home.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An investment door goes to and an energy converter comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly because it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium pad, that's only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, you are if I say you, if I have cast me out using shipments and TV hours and how to function my brain, I forgot what is the real sums.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is Self-Consciousness and Peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of the history, to do the tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is the voice of God in my ear, but perhaps you whispered to me the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my son wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make it a solid rule, so that I can rid of them as a workflow of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no other choice. I have no other option if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not ansaterpise to play as long as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does woe,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather than home at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a man does better works than being a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">To be honestly, I call myself "Titanium. --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too lazy, one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We look around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grinder soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiffed, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take hold on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why did we ever hear with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">You might hold me for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">Since you probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me maximum 15 minutes, until they have tasted that they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Lady beetle or biscuit will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenager-daughter spent all 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, there is no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each one can get 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad-stop-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no rush.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children were finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellness, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for their soul frieden.</seg>
<seg id="758">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="759">To get the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get out the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I failes and I will. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It needs time, but after a few months Open a door opens, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fills me and my soul. you despise me to new ideas. I use it back in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums are not I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's good to me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who plays to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play anymore.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still functional. my storage life is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more thankful I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better work I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I run, the marathon, I run, the screens, the flax, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, unstable, nude and new feeling of living in me. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I raised you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play anymore.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosuring.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a severe stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low ability to take self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe infringement of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, trying to improve the nerve function by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known ones, the "deep-brain stimulation," thus implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons that improves neurologic function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that have suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation yet does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">We come to this dream for my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior leader and working day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain traumata brain traumata stimulates the brain and the crankin pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must decrease the Skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Therefore we have to remove a swollen snib mass sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen harsh mass, we decided to analyze Jean-François Brunet, a biologist of my colleagues, a biologist who analysing the brain compound.</seg>
<seg id="818">What will I do with this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">That is not a light task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells originate from one tissue piece, comparable to small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive it.</seg>
<seg id="823">Just that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed to make Jean François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like as a master cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may still know from the biological lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep and small zeroes.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very rapid.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells of hot Doubbleortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain tissue cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of Fötus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why did they get to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find in higher concentrations close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source that permits brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain compound from the non-linguistic area and then the cells just cultivated as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And it will mark on colour to track it in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step, we implanted them on the occasion of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologetic Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in cerated brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been taken down completely after a few weeks, they would have been taken back home. the room is already busy, they will not need there, so vanish them.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added an injury to and implanted the same cells and now kept the cells - they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof they show them are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, coloured in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help those cells are necessary to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual blending task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feather of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stabilized dexterity level, we witnessed the motoric cortex-motorized area in the motoric cortex area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Subsequently the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hands anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover a certain degree like in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">As we were certain that the monkey achieved his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side they see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Well, when we implanted the cells, the same monkey, two months after implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it freezing and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still being implanted with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you soon as we can show you the human brain's means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know anyone who can need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely at any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what are the greatest obstacles before completing clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look into the future -- You have completed the research and tried permission to start clinical trials. if you see further in the future, how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then, one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to do and evaluate treatments, if it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one has to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first actually prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and sure it is, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and you have told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We make a major mistake in the West as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider that they are unaltered.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing proved that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while the politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy come with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I relied Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup - that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect the savings programs which were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better recess for Lee kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my coming friends who would repeat me if they could change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in together with me, that Lee kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our societies are painted to face our future dark and spectacular, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">To the topic of waste I would like to refer to an interesting contradiction that currently our host rock is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schodenberg, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe, and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to inevitable savings and corporations, however, could invest there, where it could be productive and income, with whom one might produce productive mountain and also to produce all the things that humanity are urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, a total of 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in the US, England and in the euro zone, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial machines, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars currently sounds as much money until they were compared with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to spread apart from the stock and property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital make the twin summit which are not covered by common market mechanisms by common market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently, a low demand advocates that they could not invest in which they could not invest in which they could kill him, that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances which leads to it, that Öthfulness kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely fical art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents, and to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies, which are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed: what do we understand?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the society type, control the free and the poor as a majority to the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenical democracy decided of course too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the job value of Athenian democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenical democracy was and that she did not only agree with the working arms, but are not just the right to free expression, but important and crucial that they gave them the right to political participation with equal baldness in questions of the State Counts.</seg>
<seg id="935">Indeed, the athenical democracy was not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shinates very bright, it is quickly spread quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today's liberals did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only on when a full separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was abolished in politics as the economy -- so the world of the corporations - a democratiefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the time of which the separation between politics and economics began, a hereditary struggle between the two continued, and the economy gradually destructed the politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It lies in mind that today it can be in the government but nevertheless not in power, because the power of the policies were dispared into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I also mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of smokers which nourishes the animals as sustainably the animals, that they are nourished, so that they are starred at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that radicalised the policy so far, that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political property is increasing, the overall economic demand is falling and the managing director of the corporations are to invest, the cash of its company is to invest.</seg>
<seg id="948">The majority of capitalism is selling the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher will the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human strength and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the "Demos" keeps control, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only achieve a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of breeding and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing, by replacing low-money employees by automation and robotic.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem of this problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, and social conflicts greater, as it is - already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">We have to combine the economy and to unite the fields of business and politics, and care that we democratically replace the reunited sphere, otherwise we end up in a disease hyperautoclan, which can appear to the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question isn't whether capitalism is brought to the technical achievements, that it will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether to be superseded by a Dysterie, similar to the "matrix," or by something that the society enters into "Star Trek," or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, "Agora," in long talks the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dysterie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples soon.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please make a capital market, in which one deserves money while you are working and where your funds will be within you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one operates just -- is the property of them working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and outcomes and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who belong to the company but they are not working there, but employees who work there, but no diving more between capital and work, no big gaps between investment and sharks, and ultimately does not have any standing twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please explain shortly before our national currencies had a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency, we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and every government is paying the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading income of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment is rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not possible to implement the technical means.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I cast you is at the same time that they are privileged people, and marxistic as they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to be sinking into a matrix? - similar dystcyie?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to choose politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It's in our hands, and we do it even better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You defend yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of these crisis of a part of the earth to the next, as we see it, it will not only be able to destabilise our democracy, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am completely effective.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not effective, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophy -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned in Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you have from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our Liberal democracy we have a guarantee of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy does, -- a completely democratiefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain respects, if I may say that so provocative may China is similar to China today the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect Liberalism to democracy -- that is an error, historically regarded as an error.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical, regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be seen in China, very similar to the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China to act now to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Hellas at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I think that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal visibility, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the self-ability of goodbye, and denying that a massive donation is passed through the Eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to open the first proposal on the basis of the Greek Vorbis -- by the way that denying this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It right to make it right. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Euro Area, continues to denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know, what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try a economic system that is not overwearing due to political will and authoriarianism, it will perhaps be possible for a while, but if then the change happens, it happens to abruptly and destroy.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what ways are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back - serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or there is any minister after 6 months in office, especially in such a clamped situation, claiming that he did not make any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I did mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the school program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest in pages of the money, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring out our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortion caused by the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to understand that they had a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">That is worse than the great depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the money that has raised us this policy, "was a colossy mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: in spite of all that, and despite the aggressive tone of conversations, it seems to be even better per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticisms of the European Union and the eurozone opposite to anyone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they survived, the released fliers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe but for the whole world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We probably are the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we introduce ourselves to the way of a post-modern 1930, then it appears to be well also for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for you were with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Von Roy 'never heard most of it, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your lifetime on 19th April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision by breaking the Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is the executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, lean and describes himself on Twitter as "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the contents of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, it is a very hard round industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy can not choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, it must find shows that are located right on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This turn is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows how "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that, after you see a season, your brain asks: "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that's enough to tell you what about this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not expect to come on the left side of the turn, because I think it takes special intelligence in order to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">It turns out more thoughts about the average recess, the average television, the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they just inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's also the first time that Amazon makes something something like Roy's nothing risks.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses the first episode of TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch them free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is in vain for something, do you feel right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they know not that they are observed when looking at this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team, who can record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pauses, which parts can be skipped or checked again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide on these data you should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process and process the reply, and this is the answer: "Amazon was able to make a Sitcom over four republican US broadcast."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many things can remember that show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average, but not just what Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time, another managers have placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for a super-show, and it also uses the data, but it makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than holding a competition, he and his team stowed the existing data on the Netflix spectator, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a car and decided to do not a Sitcom over four transformers, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" receives a 9.1-rating on this turn. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, is the question: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitives, data-diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic implies that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that is met, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistic for back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized for very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not functioning, then this is something frightening because we live in a time, in which we have more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one has ever comes in contact with this software. come in contact with this software, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If somebody asks in the US in prison and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like on Amazon and Netflix. instead of to decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Median television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis is, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. that's not what a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data and most experienced firms are actually wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does not make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict out data analysis of influenza, its worst manner, -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news: the success was culminated in a release in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the result of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data underrun companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes do something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data leads to the decisions of life -- at the workplace, at the right of legal, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-supported genetics -- an area where some very smart people can benefit unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, do mostly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">The most important place of this problem in its single parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, set the individual parts again to deal with a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and assemble them again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle the problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">But there is another tool and we own it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, parts and pieces can be merged again, even if the information is incomplete, especially if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore I believe, Netflix was so successful because they are data and understanding, where they are also involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else could it be capable of. but the decision how to put all these parts again and makes it a show like "House of Cards" that was not understood in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things work down when data are going to start our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will become...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before going on, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or No-question you just need to shake the ball to get a reply. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will then wipe it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I've met some decisions in my life so far. I could listen to the ball in the afternoons.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, just as you know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In that way, perhaps the ball clüger and clever and clever. finally, it is approaching us to make decisions when we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I guess it as very encouraging news that it is still paying in spite of the great amount of data always paid out to make decisions to be an expert in that which you do, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">By the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
