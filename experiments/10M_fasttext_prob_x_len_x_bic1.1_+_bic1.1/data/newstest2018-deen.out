Munich - 1856 : four cards that change your view over the city
a w@@ ander An@@ st@@ alt , where you@@ ths should meet today .
a greeting on which is dug up for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the influ@@ ential reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it su@@ cks when maps are not currently available .
this knows what had to be fur@@ ious , because the car navigation was given a green grass instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , a supply of the Ge@@ op@@ ort of Bavaria within the state government , are all other than currently - but just very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current Online Cards .
then the cities and municipalities in the area of Munich has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a flip @-@ carpet , which one can &apos;t know as such .
in the great overview map for cities and communities with more detailed maps , so @-@ called deci@@ du@@ el leaves .
this was created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ance administration between 1810 and 1864 , and ski@@ p the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon called an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops arrived at the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9th , 1801 : there were the current neighbours , who created the idea of a widespread Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; and thereby the Bavarian State Department .
the certificate of Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Lloyd &apos;s website .
the comparison of the spring / day is the example of the capital at the most impressive .
the town has expanded in all directions and grew up .
one example is the under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that di@@ ps a relatively isolated map in the 1856 map .
ship@@ wreck was created 21 years after the map of the map , i.e. 1877 , at Munich &apos;s subur@@ b .
today there is under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling in the middle of the city .
the houses of the shelter is located around 1856 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named only 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , you can see nothing as a fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ anium , &quot; from which the property is derived .
small plots have no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Theres@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , which had been the scene of the October 1810 , was indeed a meadow , and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar there is a historical map an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the jung@@ le , you are reading in the district of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen &apos;s name &quot; at the br@@ once &quot; or from the height &quot; At the fan &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; mistaken An@@ st@@ alt &quot; .
yes , here at the auction field they once locked people with mad@@ ness .
it was established here in 1858 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er fans . &quot;
beginning in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and finished for example the so @-@ called w@@ l of the so @-@ called mistaken .
in addition , he says the staff , violence against its occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
the first number of 280 patients was first place , later was extended to 500 seats .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair in 1905 .
since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric atri@@ cs .
in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , yo@@ ungst@@ ers meet at the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and turned it into a youth center with training .
West is the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , east of houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built by 2015 in an architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during World War II .
the Marien@@ platz was named as &quot; Main Square &quot; in 1856 , called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change was in the Second World War even at the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allied Forces in December 1944 had many holes in downtown .
a big remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a tomb in the Middle Ages stood at the Marien@@ hof , where these days are the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn route .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill in the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
Civil Rights Publ@@ ished Travel Guide for Missouri
the National Association for Promot@@ ing Far@@ es has issued a warning for colour people who travel to Missouri due to the discrimin@@ ating politics and the ra@@ cial attacks of the state of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which will come into effect by August 28 , 2017 , invites af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ ce@@ ans , since a series of un@@ question@@ able , road @-@ based inci@@ dents in the entire state and here will be noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a newly published law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult to win discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state that un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate minority groups , ad@@ ver@@ ted the group to release traveler &apos;s rice , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have the injuries of civil rights to happen .
they are treated because of their skin colour , they will be put together or killed , &quot; said the president of Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the Group cited inci@@ dents like ra@@ cial violation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
in the early days of un@@ question@@ able circumstances , after that he had no more petrol during the journey through the state , and was taken away by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime .
the Council also shows a recently published report of the Office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney of Missouri , in which black drivers will be more common in the state 75 per cent more common than the wh@@ it@@ eness .
&quot; the recommendation is that the people are aware of and about their families , friends and employees , what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; the people must be willing to bring it to the ship or the relatives have to know that they travel through the state . &quot;
Missouri recorded in the year 2015 100 Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ elt , the FB@@ I , which entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
it is also a reply to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination .
prior to previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel agencies for Texas and Arizona , the local authorities under@@ take to ple@@ dge people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the conclusion of AC@@ L@@ U to further road profiles .
trav@@ ellers are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in the last time advoc@@ acy groups have made the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ent@@ ar
the her@@ ed@@ acher electric fence project is a success project and is continued in the next year .
the CDU @-@ Bundestag b@@ ass@@ lands Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac had an image to be found on site .
at the excav@@ ation yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the her@@ ed@@ acher CDU Association joined the Association of Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EP@@ s .
Markus Schwen@@ n@@ mann first granted in@@ sights into his operation , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 acres of forest cultivated , 40 dairy cows and as many yo@@ ungst@@ ers served and accom@@ o@@ date in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &apos;s milk &quot; is the alternative way for him for the milk of his cows , as part of Schwen@@ n@@ mann .
the table of holiday guests is exclusively Regional .
since he is also a B@@ L@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the electric fence project as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar important . &quot;
I can not generate profits on real steep areas .
the green land care for much work , a lot must be mach@@ ined with the sense sense .
&quot; we have been here with the terms and conditions to fight with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed by Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 he took over the farm and took management of these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not lead a bi@@ os@@ ier .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider , he was clear : &quot; the community has recognized the importance of the fence projects and is glad for the leader in funding . &quot;
the farmers are required at costs between 3000 and 4000 Euros per hectare .
I hope that the evacu@@ ation of the surface could be gone out for a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and do thoughts on how they bring their operations , &quot; stressed the mayor .
the farmers have often in the criticism
a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 with a total of 25 plots .
the open surface area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be ro@@ amed until at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders was funded , a quarter contributed the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac bet@@ wi@@ ped : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and gu@@ ins do not go . &quot;
also for Peter White Stand fast : &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the state @-@ fle@@ ction line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state funding of Wei@@ de@@ vis@@ ors .
the aim is to dis@@ close the Black Forest .
prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed convey@@ ors .
Moreover , that may not be an ir@@ reversible area not discharge ( slopes of 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ atory .
currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build up close 16 kilometres of fence to the fishing project in 2018 .
the accounting surface is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to start if they start to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate the same as every other - hence the carefully selected fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s down@@ ward position in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did when he had an symbolic Ax@@ t in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals for dra@@ stic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ot@@ ers and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have l@@ yn@@ red him if he had done it .
but he handle their significance , and especially the importance that it was attributed to her when the famous Po@@ em by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em which you can refer to which was later added , not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly properly , but as he formulated it , doesn &apos;t really go about history .
it is about contemporary reson@@ ance on the abandoned words of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state doesn &apos;t only invites any old influence , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your labor , your poor , and your op@@ pressed mass , that is to bre@@ athe freely , / the se@@ ash@@ ore of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; s@@ ling waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a bro@@ ader political and cultural con@@ front@@ ation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who said to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , showing the female representation of the female per@@ formers of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its po@@ em is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself is another name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the picture with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American Nati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change the right from right wing for a long time .
the great cry of the Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was obj@@ ection@@ ate , but rather a early neo @-@ conservative daily , which would bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
fairly un@@ common is Lim@@ bau@@ ma here on anything .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus existed in it to see how they were seen from exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships .
it &apos;s in tru@@ est sense therefore to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome you have to hear .
and this is not what you want to know the Per@@ spective , Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine forth the way , but the hat@@ red that is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black commen@@ ds Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two shots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance of the Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship header has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m track , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen from the team to team @-@ military .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is fairly modest .
her capit@@ als talk was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or , wherever they live or practice , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling I did , the Eil@@ id@@ h , was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth Silver Medal , who will compete with its fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; that 16 sh@@ ot@@ ters in the British team are .
the best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ hau@@ l Mu@@ ir runs on this path in five British and two European records .
it is going to take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to see the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the elite chapters says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also may be mixed with the medals and among the fin@@ als .
&quot; so special about team capit@@ als , it lies in the fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was enough for me to vote for me that my team mates voted for me and chose me to something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i , which belong to the team .
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes w@@ ishing to rise to Po@@ dien .
what do my speech cont@@ empl@@ ated as chapter ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just noted that we are very happy in that situation , since we have a home World Cup .
so it is really important to use this home support and benefit from it that we are back on the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere since there . &quot;
block e@@ wers via Facebook : don &apos;t work for a public office if you don &apos;t want to reduce the elec@@ torate of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers sl@@ ash him because of all , from the inner policy up to its political principles .
he mar@@ ched in the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not bring his critic to silence .
because in 1783 , Washington said , &quot; Free Spe@@ ech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and m@@ ute we are led as sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work on it more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 persons and have been deleted that they have sold their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endants it this week from the beginning of that week .
the staff of the Govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said a lot of people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor with an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing .
he has the second highest consent of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary p@@ inion .
he has shown a fixed hand during the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary funding to connect to his voters and de@@ pu@@ ties his ha@@ un@@ loose head according to chemotherapy .
thus , the blocking of persons coming on the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse res@@ cu@@ ed the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the comments of comments made nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of rolls or legs or h@@ asser@@ t people that swing online the wh@@ ip .
the Post Office spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a past@@ or , no roller .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , th@@ ink@@ able and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
lawyer at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crow@@ ded , but she asked after Hass@@ elt .
&quot; I commented on the pol@@ ite that I dis@@ appointed it was no reaction to hate Hass@@ elt and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the news post@@ age &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t realize this idea if a number of people on the same topic takes place , then they are mis@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the staff of the govern@@ ors &quot; reported as &quot; focused spam attack &quot; would be able to call &quot; Inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the fac@@ ebook story makes it easy to use a message by simply blocking a critics or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical leadership and burn , or demonstr@@ ators , or demonstr@@ ators .
but exactly this happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials responsible for this , that he has implic@@ itly defines Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter Fe@@ ed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County se@@ eded the First A@@ ci@@ ment , according to the US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is at Alexandria when she appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U to its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be as hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable p@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers spread between 1776 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter collected upon his leadership .
and then Washington had anonymous 15th roll .
the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote all the letters of papers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ised its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation of the United Kingdom , have been overwhel@@ med by the United Kingdom , according to historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought her to silence .
Rede@@ em , Free Spe@@ ech and Dis@@ courses are on the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European Union No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days for their home comforts as the Renaissance Club in the East Loth@@ ian is held the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the Left to En@@ dr@@ on last year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament scene in the name of the club green and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a good state .
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is a e@@ ager@@ ly suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really especially interested in , &quot; said the player in South@@ port located in South@@ port .
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I had won it from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
rec@@ olle@@ ction of the past year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win here .
it was a really special time and one that &apos;s always appreciated . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to its home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you don &apos;t feel that additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it to play and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it has gone down . &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major champ@@ ions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ites .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six fle@@ ets on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer caused by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died because of passive cell lung cancer .
researchers from the university hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study are coming to this result .
&quot; according to our estimates , a year 167 lung cancer were attributable to passi@@ v@@ smoking , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he received his own study on this topic in 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases because of passive cattle per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections inv@@ ent themselves as a complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and are reas@@ on@@ ably more reas@@ on@@ ably in time , &quot; thus the ladder of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of domestic connections , the situation is difficult , as in the underground , much ver@@ sid@@ y , which is not noticed in the plans .
the traffic , which is always attached to the construction work , is a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ms of drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ smith is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the buses would be entitled to drive .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Cost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p since weeks work on the bridge with work on the bridge .
&quot; the hot days had been very beautiful .
but fortunately we were supplied from our friend Fritz Matt with cooler mineral water , &quot; told Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked , it uses no cooker .
they even use a pot but rarely used .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ im@@ press in the in@@ tran@@ qui@@ ally Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually called a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the carbon@@ ated kno@@ b with e@@ ager , un@@ washed hands is taken and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - it has no furniture - where she also performs their daily work , e.g. clothes with tur@@ tle water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ tice .
the youngest of four wives of her husband were not assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is usual here .
of course it can be too hard to work : most vill@@ agers are jo@@ bless , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one wants to walk around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elderly people should vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that had reached independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jakarta , which maintains control of the region , and foreign journalists or legal rights .
in 2003 , the province was split officially in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea was the eastern part of the island .
so far as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ dial 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses that are surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o bar@@ ns , and of corrugated board which have been converted by rust in various gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their trip here , sof@@ ar as journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua was a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark Hem@@ p and her bright rock .
&quot; previously we had only sheets to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s warm@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but there is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has fallen in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has over wood@@ resources in the value of estimated $ 78 billion .
but this wealth is a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s mighty forces keeps its fir@@ stly presence .
a survey of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units were paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ u@@ ian demands according to larger autonomy thre@@ aten these golden limb@@ s and are treated gn@@ ashing .
according to the activists more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were murdered by the Indonesian army since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .

in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers in the past year alone .
&quot; we don &apos;t understand anything &quot; in a report of the patri@@ arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane , from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electrical advice are particularly popular according to another report - and brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , since Muslim sectors will come from the most populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ons sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ uts .
local people fight for it here .
&quot; the migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local which moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it is the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ m@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - its market costs . &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as a Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 , said the im@@ bal@@ ances and the infr@@ in@@ gement of Pap@@ ua .
the old carp@@ entry took 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little things , and today the loc@@ als feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will satisfy our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered an underground car only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is .
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children without and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the fri@@ gh@@ tened children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers taking their tone and later returned to four soldiers , the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
soldiers who had drunk drunk , and they struck the group with their def@@ enses , said victims and witnesses .
then another soldier turned into the group of children .
a child , who had 16 @-@ year old y@@ ag@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to sm@@ ite that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building was placed nearby the nearby governmental commission and the things es@@ cal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they were frag@@ ment@@ oni@@ ously Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led to the Wa@@ ita dance - a bird wat@@ ering - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago stock .
some demonstr@@ ators started to towing in police and military police .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers had sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ fourth quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger and called for peace and ur@@ ged the amount to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
k@@ ay@@ ame does not always know who fired people , but says that the ball was out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired . &quot;
the native husband Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , like his c@@ ousin , the witness to the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and sought his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is like many Indones@@ ians only a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I was kissed him . &quot;
the Chief Spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ end , said Rep@@ or@@ ters who only wanted to buy their heads of their station only &quot; because they attacked .
&quot; we must defend us if people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many wounded .
the messages about the T@@ öt@@ t@@ uns appeared only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech held in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura in which he ou@@ ched sympath@@ ies for families of victims and s@@ ware that go to the historical ab@@ normal@@ ities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want that this case will be solved immediately , so that there will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
Prime Minister H@@ anto said in October 2016 that he appe@@ aled an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the closing of human rights violations .
but the talks began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ies and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed to tackle these bar@@ ges , but there are processes that are going through . &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat , when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; accused that more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or bloody independence of 1999 said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ ference .
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took these alleg@@ ations with fur@@ ious un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai was afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the dead , the military sought to me , &quot; he says .
the shooting ies have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the Manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , died one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was d@@ row@@ ned than he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
he prot@@ ested the vill@@ agers in front of the Fir@@ m of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers in@@ sist@@ ed stones on officers who responded by decl@@ ines warning shots .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to score on the amount and killed .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that it will give ven@@ geance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital , and it was a witness how the last here comes quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
in this way , the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the army officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the Police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a peaceful assembly for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the country of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al that live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many included the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the rebellion led to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by attack@@ ing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ oya .
the reaction to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some sc@@ uba diving again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten village . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for indi@@ genes .
bread is just as a reach .
the people here use everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
you keep the majority of the harvest@@ ing for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a co@@ ed only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities grew between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in a larger number since the opening of new air routes .
the few jobs that are in the region will usually go to the better educ@@ ated and we@@ al@@ thy migran@@ t .
pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company more competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... for here there &apos;s no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the President of Pan@@ i@@ ai , President of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of the international media are cl@@ amped .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign were to raise restrictions on reporting to support transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ tran@@ qui@@ eted provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; said he in a statement .
lack of press controls means that the international pressure on Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neigh@@ bors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ w@@ fish states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Salom@@ oning Islands - to investigate the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have seen historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir showed the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalist in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to impos@@ e the evidence for human rights . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments take this note .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited her silence and op@@ pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; in accordance with a source , who also participated in the session but he would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will probably say that they are probably not to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , under the constant thre@@ ats of a li@@ br@@ arian army is living in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; bl@@ ame &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they need no money , they want only righteousness , &quot; he says .
in spite of the thre@@ ats and in@@ scriptions , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ op@@ t led a last symbolic figure of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the dead bodies of an ox was buried on a site opposite the police and military station .
they know that perhaps of justice will never be justified , but at least they will not forget their crimes against their crimes .
&quot; one member of our family was killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us says with strengthened head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ ken@@ scrat@@ ches of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential en@@ ligh@@ thous@@ es of the world in Dubai . hundreds of inhabitants escaped from the 337 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , who walks in only two years through the high @-@ rise , which is acci@@ dentally named the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and are sitting at the fire al@@ arms and at the cry of the people .
we ran down the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dub@@ ais civilian authorities said that the units of fire control against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 PM GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building stopped .
the government said they work on the provision of accomod@@ ations for those affected .
the incident may answer any questions regarding the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of damage from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and covering at the London Gren@@ adi@@ coat tower in June might have contributed to the spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis group ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , this sport failed to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets , with skin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but even therefore , very estimated five sentence classics remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision but are dis@@ appointed that our member nations did not assume the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need an amendment to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
it will continue to work to improve the candidate .
not only for the vote , after many claims , the proposal had occurred , the finale at a neutral place .
new starting in 2018 only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the right to host the host in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places , etc. are ligh@@ tened , and the players must complete less official media events prior to the Davis Cup .
over 1 of 5 US travelers banned items into the aircraft , finding a survey out
a survey among passengers that revealed that more than 20 percent are aware of or un@@ aware of objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which entered the plane while they were acci@@ dentally verb@@ al knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they could have been delayed to have ir@@ rever@@ ed weapons with fire@@ arms , mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ terer Inc . , it also asser@@ ted that younger trav@@ ellers could re@@ ject the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , allow@@ ances when trying to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the X generation were .
the most common objects which were inten@@ s@@ led to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated to have borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ dents were also confirmed that they had been deliber@@ ately banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it was asked for travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally emp@@ t@@ ying might have been brought by the airport safety and how many things were inten@@ tionally done .
there is no surprise that people who were most likely to suffer from the most often sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware - who were most frequently used on the most common .
however , the company shows that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
human beings are often uns@@ af@@ e , which may take them or how much of it .
so , it is no surprise that the biggest amount of objects of the T@@ SA captured objects are prohibited .
for a time the fol@@ ks , the T@@ SA could see books as a sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are not allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : for ten thousands of Tesla customers to cancel order
electro @-@ Exchange s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is interested in the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far realized that a part of the customer has withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation back again .
besides the triumph@@ ant numbers on sales out@@ pac@@ ed and even more challenging market targets , Tesla @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k , at the announcement of the recent Quar@@ terly Financial account for the first time , showed a few gl@@ ass@@ ent numbers : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months Mus@@ k had applied more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , which begins delivery just before .
therefore Mus@@ k said : from the total of 5@@ 18.000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 have been withdrawn .
critics always noted that it is only for non @-@ binding reservations .
for a cancellation , Tesla pays the amount of € 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
there are 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations confirmed in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
so that the cancellation of until now approximately twelve percent of all orders could be sent to the problem , the Tesla boss doesn &apos;t believe .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production site .
Tesla supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles last year .
2018 - all models can be collected - 500.000 each , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 requests are currently expected .
those who wish to order today is a &quot; Model 3 &quot; for the second half of 2018 at the earliest . if Tesla creates it , his brand new , never ever tested yet in practice with maximum utilization of utilization .
many experts do that this is possible .
however , however , comes to greater del@@ ays , then the im@@ it@@ ability of the reservations may be a problem for Tesla .
because then the company can &apos;t stop un@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back because of the exp@@ ulsion of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , took his former decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ caused air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to be the need for the needs of government agencies , compared to the re@@ ac@@ tional activities .
he didn &apos;t mention the complaint against his previous passage in a German Federal Court of Appeal .
it &apos;s about a deadline that went on October 1 for States to comply with the government &apos;s standards for gar@@ land ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will provide compliance with a year to study more time to study their agency , to avoid the plan and to hin@@ der it in local decisions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump National At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent in@@ viol@@ inist environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been forced to block or delayed control of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden back of the Wednesday is the youngest legal return for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory @-@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ administrator has exceeded his authority as he tried to exp@@ ire the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , to w@@ ander oil and gas companies to supervision and reducing me@@ than@@ le@@ cks .
in a review that published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt was ahead of that his k@@ ills at ozone @-@ standards simply simply compl@@ ained about the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the countries through the complex process of perfect ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; the EPA also often observed its dead@@ lines for the implementation and then maintained in order to be accused of activists , and in an agreement stipulated an appointment for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ endants the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by proce@@ eding , and we accept dead@@ lines .
we will also take the law and authority who gives us seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA , that P@@ ru@@ itt sometimes made his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal means , to ensure that the &quot; regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the congress on a more comprehensive implementation of the ozone rules .
one last month of approval bill is to be subject to the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was still not set up in the Senate .
the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition led by the States , which pro@@ claim the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to just@@ ify the legal pressure .
&quot; the return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million Americans that are affected by the Smo@@ g , who flow@@ ed directly from the Smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York provided itself in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil ozone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals , and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists will be joy@@ ful thinking about the changing course of the exchange changes .
&quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying , how much print it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible person responsible for the protection of air that we in@@ hal@@ ed &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological battle of the Tr@@ ump government to fight environmental contamination and their special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius of the Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ Church , is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm at a Ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether the idyllic situation and beautiful view of the village is the historic centre of Hil@@ arius and a popular place to stay .
visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and conveyor belts to their concerns .
Walter Martini : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ ere jewe@@ l . &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ischer diplomatic book &quot; : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain to the astronom@@ ical parish church together with the Vog@@ et@@ yl of Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church also a splendid courtyard , belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice vers@@ a .
so there were also people there .
as out of the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , in addition to the under@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , today it was even visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlements of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 burned these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ ate law originated from the early medieval O@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen@@ recht .
a Lord who built a church , and occupied with a past@@ or , remains to the owner of this church and could also inherit these owners .

Association wants to check permission from Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; does not expect any legal requirement for building and thus turned back to the land council .
the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has asked &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ens ( CDU ) asked to withdraw his approval for the erection of wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in four quarters , only at the time limit on Sch@@ wal@@ let tal already exists a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time caused the concentration zone but an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city area .
such zones should avoid a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
although the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier through a change of land control area in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the District government of Düsseldorf had not been approved because of a form@@ ulas .
&quot; the lack of planning permission is the subject of approval pursuant to illegal rights and therefore again , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens said , &quot; said &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; said . &quot;
current state of things : the city council has decided in front of the summer break once again the wind concentration zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . an approval of the District government is still available .
Er@@ kens : &quot; thus , an approval is excluded for the establishment of wind turbines planned by law . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the order .
&quot; the corresponding letter have been entered in the circle four last week , &quot; announced a spokes@@ person .
the circle takes her to the occasion to consider the matter .
however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in the circle on Thursday with regard to the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to the construction of four per 200 metres high .
already last year , the company , which is involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , is closed , lease contracts with the owners of approximately 65 hectares .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs .
the NEW Re aims to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past sum@@ mers there were four green light to purchase three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a stake in the wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .

calls on telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on his request to speak publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president im@@ min@@ ted him because he publicly disp@@ uted the wall . in addition , he said to him : &quot; this cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the United States , and s@@ ware to pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Key were also published and revealed a cl@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ al said that a trade for the United States refugees to take over &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; said that the existence of the government would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban to res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA .
Mr. Tr@@ ump was able to call the call after he had spoken the Lord s@@ wis@@ s , &quot; that is the most wanted call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ ages : activ@@ ist ra@@ cial Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came up with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man mid @-@ age in a needle strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar , looking at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants are in fear .
&quot; we want to cut this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ushed the man .
&quot; get it off the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es out of silence when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22 , was only one re@@ location .
but when a sn@@ ares are thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them in the audience will shoot very real epidemic .
since 2005 , civil rights advoc@@ ates to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , in which two black pairs - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ sey as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - born from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been indicted for murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really ir@@ reversible , that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we know them in our municipalities even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks that assi@@ sts in the organisation of re@@ location .
&quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year old former Congress of State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him it serves as a dramatic call for action and provides an annual reminder of the Monroe community , that there was never been corrected .
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ uted , we want the termination , we want to reconciliation , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice . &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a place of hearing provides a towel on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to the FB@@ I files that were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was accused ever .
although the susp@@ ects stay free for decades on free walking , citizen just@@ ify that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the decision of the Supreme Court admitted the black citizens in Georgia to take their voice to the first time in the summer .
about the same time as the election st@@ ains according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white land owner , Bar@@ ker H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly due to a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy sleep and that the baby was born not of her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison paid a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she went away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b , moved away by car .
&quot; as it emerged , it was Har@@ rison who prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged it , &quot; includes a FB@@ I report .
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between government and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks app@@ tic@@ ulates it yet .
&quot; it was a voting right massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you register , and if you agree , then you will happen to you . &quot;
almost a decade of Lang , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene led the yearly reference to the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is vi@@ vid , h@@ itting and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe he would not exist in America .
it is difficult to see , and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with Him in all con@@ fron@@ ts , &quot; said it .
&quot; but I can not build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I did through . &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day appro@@ ached nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and watched as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ Director .
he played the role of chief &apos;s role played for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ col@@ m and Bar@@ ker H@@ ester to play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester @-@ cri@@ es and ur@@ gently pressed him to hat@@ red with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; I said , n --- he disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona leads the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the h@@ ott@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ever .
&quot; I don &apos;t think that the white people at that time &apos; n --- he said . &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; wit@@ ted one of the other black per@@ formers .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and in fact , the energy has shi@@ fts in the room , a sense of camera leadership replaced the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona the N word says he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
the repet@@ ition ends and quickly .
there are cri@@ es , shots , and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a dress @-@ dress , stands on the bodies of the actors and leads the &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; star@@ ring .
your voice breaks out on each second word .
about a hundred meters behind him a group of about four dozens of people caught swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple left from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street .
they all experienced Georgia almost eight hours of Geor@@ gios pressed moisture when Bro@@ oks they lead them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de stayed a ne@@ c@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you took up on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ mur@@ ders took place , the air @-@ dispens@@ er feels .
if the last notes of the songs sounds , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to inspec@@ ting the body .
children up to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ pers each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; star@@ red a little boy , as if he had to remember it .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene the quantity - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x road and their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw surrounded by Brad@@ sh@@ aw , the man in suit which has played the C@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ms two of his co @-@ gam@@ ers , and then broke out in their poor weeping , and the emotional load of performance breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ate one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this from a reason . &quot;
later the audience deals with the actors to the dinner together .
a white pair of Atlanta troubled at a table with a black pair that they got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski strug@@ gled to find words , which has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of the people who look like yourself and those things , because they look like , &quot; said it .
&quot; what really do I do with me , believe me that Lyn@@ ne is still going on , &quot; she said , &quot; Today , it is called only police shooting . &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s farm holds on its table , he e@@ ats and reminds of civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the conclusion is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because she describes the hor@@ ror of what we have experienced , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s like that if we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again .
he who doesn &apos;t study their own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; god@@ parents &quot; conf@@ essed the carriage of Wag@@ on@@ ians in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , Director Frank Cast@@ orf is based on a colourful , six @-@ store@@ yed back@@ drop .
the Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an optional street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from East times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , pos@@ ing the Rh@@ en@@ et@@ aker as a rock decoration , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
rock dy@@ es recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moving through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three fre@@ ighter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - just like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; .
she ch@@ ased the Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , de@@ capit@@ ated in Hollywood man@@ ier , in the boot and enter the Kra@@ Wal@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ fying Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heavy duty box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he proposes Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) must also believe it .
the audience than@@ ked it with a powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself hum@@ ble and hands towards Merkel @-@ cat@@ ching .
big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat back in Leg@@ erer leisure .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam label .
in 2013 , he had to leave a member of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto for himself , and five years later , in which the b@@ aff@@ ed &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down .
Katharina Wagner is expected to have pleasure in this way .
&quot; note that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring in a certain way , &quot; had said it shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it was also an understanding of what has grown .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunte@@ er year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
amount : normally in Schwein@@ furt in the furniture @-@ open , once in the week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open @-@ day at school .
how are your experiences so ?
lot : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so late @-@ called volunteers .
how does that come ?
quantity : I did high school .
and then a civil engineering , we say sometimes , successfully demolished .
I recognized for me that it is a folding for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
people : I &apos;ve collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will be in dual study , probably in the youth welfare office Her@@ ne a social work training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not something unusual , while volunteers have several different kind of service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it &apos;s probably always on where you make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from aging to youth - in all possible fac@@ ettes of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ g , so in the afternoon care .
for me , it was exactly the right thing which strength@@ en@@ eth me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in civil engineering ?
quantity : sure , here it is not about to reck@@ on out st@@ atics .
one has always talked about other people who have a very different story behind it .
as a refugee , a youth who has been brought out of the family - you always have to go down individually .
very interesting .
and you had no touch anxi@@ ous ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the type .
it is a field that gives a lot .
much love , a lot of kindness .
there are even more negative moments , but this is that life .
Pear@@ son is cut more 3,000 jobs and trim the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education team Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build further 3,000 jobs and will shor@@ ten their intermediate dividend by 72 percent since a further restructuring program is started to overcome the pressure with which the company is con@@ fron@@ ted .
the lead reduction , the general director John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 positions .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme for cost reduction of a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business again that was hit by the quick step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for fiscal year remained unchanged , after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy of Kabul : NATO @-@ soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , NATO soldiers killed and several other viol@@ ates , civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been injured , an explanation of NATO .
apart from un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed in the incident at Q@@ arab@@ on@@ h in the district of Q@@ arab@@ on@@ h .
the bombing of strikes that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
in an opinion of Nato , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint pat@@ rol was attacked with the Afghan Army &quot; by a &quot; of people who were attacked &quot; by individuals . &quot;
the statement says that all the last in a stable state are in a stable condition and to be treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the Group , which is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ on@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide @-@ suicide network of at least 30 people killed in a central district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the le@@ thal mil@@ it@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops inv@@ oked the Taliban in 2001 .
the force under@@ scores the pre@@ ference security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump ab@@ p@@ onder@@ s , support the number of U.S. troops to increase the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis in public confidence in the government to have caused its policy and particularly in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ning decision of the Smo@@ g Rule according to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency made a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , requ@@ est@@ ing that the States committed to em@@ ulate the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday a decision to prop@@ el the so @-@ called &quot; ozone @-@ regulations 2015 &quot; and said they show the obligation to the agency , together with States .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA that to be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , in order to determine where inser@@ tions are made to be stric@@ ter air quality standards - delayed one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed an answer on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ tire a wide range of environmental impact that the former President Barack Obama , as part of a bro@@ ader agenda which should boost economic growth according to tr@@ ump .
the effort , however , triggered the response of the Democrats and nature reserve , which concerns about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
the S@@ EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air that does ozone does &quot; reduce the lung function and ampli@@ fy the respir@@ atory sympt@@ om &quot; as an example as@@ thma .
community plan wants to communal space
at the end , the decision was clearly : in two opposite voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ es decides to set up a joint venture in the future party complex .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot was signed , as Mayor of Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still going to date , until now the church community has been an independent area in the community , but now there is no plans for planning for a private invest@@ or .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has been offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living area of around 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with around 70 square metres of space for a special price available .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council stip@@ ulates , such a common room will not be seen as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living area , but open to the municipality .
as an example , the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round .
the decision , which was decided by providing funds for the current household has already been decided in autumn by providing support of funding .
construction is in the renovation area .
setting up a common room , it is reported that T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent are eligible .
the decision on the decision to sign@@ ment to the invest@@ or , that , in this regard , no bil@@ lets between the legs have to throw out that both arti@@ c - what is reduced to the ambient con@@ fin@@ ement - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the tr@@ ump height and the construction of an economic power - can be made possible .
un@@ necessary , that &apos;s not just Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanimously passes the panel .
it is not as easy as at the community room .
Daniela call refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one is not going on , you can now feel right now in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I do so difficult that . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne State speaks to the common room - but absolutely against a public participation .
she looks behind a covered payout of oh@@ o or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
that &apos;s not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you will not give a sub@@ sid@@ y , but get a real , in a bi@@ dder angle , the counter@@ point is the counter@@ point .
Sta@@ eh@@ ner &apos;s request to qu@@ ay the decisions correspon@@ d@@ ingly , there are three advoc@@ acy .
so , with two counter@@ parts at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller will summar@@ ises : &quot; if we cut the decision , we make a huge step , a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

to hike in the resin of star
the Federal Republic of Germany is supposed to become the first &quot; star &quot; path in the Harz mountains .
this is the association Observatory of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there exists a planet @-@ route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement , and spor@@ tive power .
the members want to stop along the planned route tables and inform about stars and stars .
in the first phase to 2018 , the association is planning to successfully reach installations at five to six locations in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ query chew@@ ing St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be complem@@ ented by the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception is playing a role in the s@@ iting selection .
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later , the star pipe train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewer will learn much worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars . &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although it is considerably removed .
also convey@@ s a selected star in which con@@ stell@@ ations can be seen at the best .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest , ob@@ servatory in northern Germany .
the site is located in the middle of the National Park resin , according to information by the Federal Office of Nature Conservation with the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there are the Mil@@ ky Way galax@@ y and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ City there are some simil@@ arity on the initiative of the plan@@ et@@ arium of Göttingen since 2003 , such as the planned star section - Plan@@ etary Plan@@ ets .
beginning in front of the Hôtel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municipality of Equ@@ al ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the poles with the individual planets - including the Pl@@ u@@ to @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k on a sphere of 6.5 mm , while the sun measures exactly 75 metres below the sun .
the total distance of the planet is just over four kilometers .
while the light from sun to Pl@@ u@@ to takes about eight hours , you need a good hour to walk with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than light in the world .
the march to the next fixed star would last a half year .

after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the supply station market wide presumably according to a ty@@ re plat@@ ter , the control of his vehicle .
the passenger car til@@ ted right into the ar@@ ches where he struck himself and then remained on the roof@@ top of gr@@ illing .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the initial supply of the delay by the rescue service the A7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then traffic on the left side of the left side could be buried at the accident .
Fort@@ y Hoffmann : &quot; rotary chain works better &quot;
after the 2 : 2 season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ing for the season open@@ er to Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
in the first season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , as the result was not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two opponents to much , and we need to fit in au@@ e even better , &quot; says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the three chain will also be further optimized .
and a fool according to a exemp@@ t , the Fort@@ resses would not come up again .
&quot; for the future it will be so no longer besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better along with the experience in preparation with the turning chain , than with the quadru@@ ple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the condition is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ ize and we do not aff@@ ord to work so many ab@@ norm@@ ality . &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if you cannot talk after a mis@@ sil@@ ly start , do not know .
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we like to focus on Sunday with four points and to focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to open from an ordinary season open@@ er . &quot;
of which his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I have only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season as well as a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even might have something fresh , because they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascending f@@ avo@@ red in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 % wherever they are still , &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna .
indeed , guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite Favor@@ it on Sunday at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we may take them away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ dit , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there are no squ@@ ee@@ pers in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must sm@@ ite from the right , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas of coach .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and over@@ sight . &quot;
and so he wants to experience his players on Sunday &apos;s day .
new Results of the Swedish Asy@@ l@@ um Review released
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method to medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old . but not everyone is believed to have the accuracy of these results .
Swedish Institute for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( N@@ ec@@ ts@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) began with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are supposed to be precise working during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ bon@@ et ) for lack of some refugees were critic@@ ized due to the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
up to now , mig@@ r@@ ations has sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2.@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency took notice that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 patients the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly stable in the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see any big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local .
the high percentage of cases , in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has prosp@@ ered over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the contrac@@ ting person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det published the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said frank@@ ly that she will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , in the X @-@ rays of wisdom teach@@ ings and MRI images are examined , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cian is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus , Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut whose work comprises the app@@ ra@@ isal of biological matur@@ ation of people , to see whether they so@@ oner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement needs to be used .
we assess the biological age in this way , is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so if we could it , &quot; said he to the Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency op@@ ted the accuracy of testing : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child is in@@ correctly assess !
the largest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;

first fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
the traffic between the building station and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated by a traffic light in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is closed .
the cost of the three bridge cranes amount to around 700 000 Euro .
it is financed by the land .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I &apos;d like to try out everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; when I gr@@ ated in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
the well known relationship of Hollywood celebr@@ ities was the way to her &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; - colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately went bitter .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette per@@ formers against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with every serious , whom I said .
or do you think , I had played it ? &quot;
after their separation , they were bis@@ exual that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always been living to the du@@ alism and has believed in it .
it never has never conf@@ used me or ob@@ stru@@ cted it .
I never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
thanks to the &quot; B@@ ang show bi@@ z &quot; but in the school day they prefer to dress her as a b@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
it really has really injured me .
when I was eleven , I would like to look like a Bu@@ b .
I really felt attack@@ ing , de@@ pressed and dis@@ appointed .
now I look back and think of me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they will not love its lov@@ ing@@ ness : &quot; the people expect you to a certain type , and that anno@@ ying me .
and perhaps I &apos;ll have some en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me before the public . &quot;

in a fun@@ eral in the northern Ug@@ and@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar there were approximately 1000 people who killed on a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt with high security arrangements .
in addition , the Minister of Defence , Urs@@ ula , of the Ley@@ en ( CDU ) , said nothing .
they called the two commented pilots but as &quot; skill of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff made from northern Germany were killed on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and was brought on Thursday by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr at the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .

even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Reg@@ im@@ ents , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have understood . &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , the Minister of the Ley@@ sin is not dangerous .
but he was also of great importance , &quot; for a country , by which we are separated from two states , &quot; said it .

Prince Hen@@ rik wants a grave in addition to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife after his wife .
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish reign is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard has already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , and called it on a message to the notification of her husband .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he didn &apos;t have the intention to join in his French hom@@ eland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a H@@ ehl out of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ill@@ ful ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have become king .
in 2016 he retired and put the title &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; .
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted to see him not as equivalent at his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief advis@@ er of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old would be yet un@@ clear .
but he didn &apos;t have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , the son of a French noble woman , had learned to know Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew to the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty in his just 50 years .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik was on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised .
my Danish hand was varied , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead Volvo , Tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ ge , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and the hier@@ arch@@ ing the brand of critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope in advance .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mist@@ akes ! &quot;

Stephan Weil resi@@ sts in indisp@@ ens@@ able that the country &apos;s day appro@@ ves rapidly its self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction will probably be on Tuesday for more information on Tuesday .
the state of the country also provides the possibility that the State Parliament enters the trust and elect a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ings@@ ler .

Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about ver@@ se@@ u@@ ke eggs .
how was the sc@@ and@@ al pass through ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech@@ es and Ans@@ wer .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect against the po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer women and consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check out the stamp of the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ fer@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder are the most recent information about the affected eggs char@@ ters .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if everything we currently know , an health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di now handles the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance project is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
however , my house has immediately switched off and has since postpon@@ ed the data subject of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are tra@@ able and health are in@@ conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able .
when in eggs the rear @-@ level content of 0.0@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time does not support the establishments .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to der@@ e@@ ager@@ ly key conditions , the production plants is no immediate gu@@ ilt .
rather , it is necessary to anticip@@ ate illegal practices of service companies with economic damage due to presum@@ ption of illegal practices .
as always there is a little control in harvest .
is it only missing at the staff or also on the coll@@ ision of jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that uncovered the process .
however , the truth also belongs to that food was not to be 100 percent excluded .
therefore , a consistent adv@@ anc@@ ings of such events and hand@@ over to the authorities in the cases , in which off@@ ences may occur are of decisive importance .
I have already done several times that I expect a frag@@ ile information from the responsible authorities .
is the regular Alar@@ ma in food @-@ sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ authorized insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in food industry is used , consumer women and consumers are dis@@ rup@@ ted .
by using this means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des fi@@ brin@@ il in the attitude of food available animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it must consistently be consistently working on all levels and working with high pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is fast and consistent .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
the rules , aimed at preventing un@@ reduced expenditure of the European soccer game , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , for the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEFA EURO , means that PS@@ G should fail eventually to finance the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) in order to buy the Brazilian population from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to $ 10 million per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars move to France .
PS@@ G can make money loose with security , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ goes and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power of the wealth of Qatar .
leaving a lot of money for acqu@@ iring a lot of money , but have to control with legitim@@ ate incl@@ usions that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business .
the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that failure to put an enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and risk to ru@@ in when banks or owners with@@ drew from their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P decreased from the concentration to the debt of their losses .
the change was that the business model that used novel Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , and then invested strongly in order to build the crew and build a global mark - to a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and even though Plat@@ ini fell from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to go out of a constant editions .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we are still aims to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared with The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package offer it can distribute the amount of the accounting for the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the redemption for the next five years will be accounted for by 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 collected the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the dead@@ liest sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at the then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players .
the UEFA is in search of clubs , trying to over@@ sol@@ o@@ ze their financial statements by making their income by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a disaster of the PS@@ G could be spontan@@ eous when the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA didn &apos;t apply as a legitim@@ ate income .
exactly this was done in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA technology was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar about payments of the World Cup Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship will be amb@@ ass@@ adors and an exclusive man@@ oeu@@ vre that could be found out for the UEFA @-@ regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be even atten@@ tive , each attempt to circum@@ venting the rules .
the UEFA room has no pre @-@ preparations with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a turnover of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars arriving a blessing for sponsor@@ ing @-@ deal , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales after the signature by at least 30 percent will advance .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players going to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars departure by taking it that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the official owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; says W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it &apos;s very difficult to respect the financial system Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new cash @-@ gil@@ ds in search of a new Sch@@ og@@ gia
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y board chocolate was produced for Swiss .
now the s@@ is@@ ses co @-@ operation in front of a possible end : the airline wrote the order .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed a corresponding report from the news agency S@@ DA published in the newspaper Süd@@ deutsche schwei@@ z on request by the news agency S@@ DA .
according to current planning , the airline will close a new contract for the first half of 2018 .
all products were reviewed and subjected to quality control every two to three years .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said spokes@@ person .
around 17 million small red @-@ white s@@ lab@@ s of 14 grams spread the passengers in front of the landing at the passengers .
at the expense , the Swiss didn &apos;t want to dis@@ continue the Swiss .
industry in@@ sider estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
however , more important is the effect of the advertising : for a chess producer it is a pre@@ stige order .
as many candidates are on the new call , the Swiss will not be betrayed .
but only Swiss manufacturers are now in question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to pursue renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be att@@ ain@@ able for an opinion .
chocolate bars spread the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before Swiss made a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut plant in cooperation with h@@ ug the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss made two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different s@@ wis@@ s@@ wine producers .
the customers of the first class with le@@ ak@@ ries are spo@@ iled by the Con@@ fis@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the business class n@@ urses passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

blow against drugs - m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police have accomplished a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in the Rot@@ ary part , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched , as the prosecutor &apos;s office in Konstan@@ z on Friday .
in this case , 15 au@@ dit@@ worth@@ iness were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and issued an arrest warran@@ ts against this .
in addition , the officials requested larger amounts of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
during the same Raz@@ zi@@ en in Italy two people were arrested .
in violation of the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
these two are likely to be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
over 300 police officers were in use .
members of the Mafia will be killed by members of the Mafia , violent violent , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y , and fr@@ ying .
already in the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Constance against the organized drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in South German room has been established .
between the authorities in Konstan@@ z and Palermo , an exchange exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ s@@ eil has almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the large insert on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in regard to the vision of the investigations , Italian national nationals with regard to Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident on the 27th of May in ke@@ epers , several shi@@ fts had been fired into a restaurant in the morning , could go to the bank account of the ban@@ de .
manner : lam@@ ents of Great Hol@@ es in the Fore@@ igners Register
&quot; data of citizens who should not dive : &quot; a report is said that the foreign regi@@ sters in Germany indicate significant short@@ com@@ ings .
the lead to partly engraved patches with asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made aware of a media report according to great g@@ aps in the country &apos;s central register .
lack of defects may result in an analysis based on asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; in part of some serious com@@ missions &quot; in an analysis carried out in the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
according to the register , ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been cared for , the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer a life , or of citizens who have become a German citizen and no longer should dive in the register . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data inputs can significantly lower return processes , &quot; that &apos;s the report to the report .
in the statistics about out@@ si@@ ent people , all EU citizens must not have to travel .
such false assign@@ ments led , &quot; however , &quot; to a united debate on the handling of travelling , is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile the Federal Government apparently began to re@@ claim refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy when they travelled from there .
this go out of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ re Zeitung reports . &quot;
accordingly , in the paper it is said that B@@ AM@@ F conduct such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , to explain the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin treaty , the treaty is responsible for refugees in the EU state .
if a migran@@ t travels to another EU country , this state may send it back to the immigration .

the Bank of England is holding interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , since the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation re@@ jects the spec@@ ulation about a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain , &quot; when she kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fied pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy decision makers ( M@@ PC ) voted in the Bank with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with this month fewer members could rise to rise , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % , and it would continue to continue the pressure on the household income , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ posted that in the coming years of interest rate it would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it , and it said that the bank costs may possibly increase by more than expected to the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economic package , which was issued a year ago after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require a time for financial plan to prepare for banks , although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision about the interest rate said the Bank said : &quot; in the central predi@@ ction of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains short , as the pressure on the real population of households continued to imp@@ ly the consumption . &quot;
to interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent would be required when the markets are expected .
the markets currently forecast the first growth in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that enh@@ ancements &quot; will be gradually called &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank for this and next year , the Bank &apos;s forecast for this and next year , is projected to be between 1.9 % and 1,7 % in May .
it retained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures increasing increasing expectations to a rate hike and the GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter although it is slightly recover from the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by a rising inflation and minor wages since the van@@ ishing first becomes worse before they get better .
she added that monetary policy in the next few years can &apos;t stop &quot; but &quot; but she added that wages &quot; wages &quot; will recover significantly in the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds , resulting in a portion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes to a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sine wave .
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank , the call has risen to interest rates , when inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ sw@@ apped households , with three political decision makers required a rise to 0.5 % in July .
the inflation decreased in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
the bank said that , on the relationship with their goal of 2 % &quot; to be &quot; completely &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ is , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the short return of the s@@ wap @-@ rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , because lending business was strongly looking for shops and to finish the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those who deal with the existing deal and g@@ ages the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many are increasingly popular with toll @-@ free options and low inst@@ al@@ ments . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should disp@@ oss@@ ess 10,000 people disp@@ oss@@ essed from HIV drug .
from September following a fight against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; transformed HIV pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment . &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ recorded im@@ positi@@ onal hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the trial , after the Court of Appeals in the last year confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court confirmed that the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the P@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance it .
the chess train announced on Thursday was announced by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as a &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) .
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will belong to the first , which will allow registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 .
pre@@ clu@@ sion hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP was significantly reduced in the risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP in front of sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to avoid HIV infection .
such pres@@ cription drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who are involved in question , are pregnant or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated .
in the clinics , participants are identified that agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a registered physician are also able to register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs in this week according to an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study is said to evaluate the full potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical data collected as it was used in large scale specifically and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; these great new intervention should be far more extensive and more successful efforts to ins@@ ulating HIV and get over .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in developing one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP when it is targeted for needy and end@@ anger@@ ed people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV @-@ epidemic .
from September to people will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really checked , and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many of many lives .
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority is now on @-@ hand that the study will soon be carried out throughout the country and that no one that has a risk for HIV is left .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was completed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10.000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Har@@ an , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to monthly late del@@ ays and ob@@ sol@@ ete implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how to be transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and termin@@ ate the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
it is important that this study is so fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will be used to contribute to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society in society . &quot;
living the large life : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banana with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne was not packed and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex @-@ bridge in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
I have made me in love with them and made a quote on that day . &quot;
since the first tour the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a single room property with a spar@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne box room and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; says she .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that had 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home , not just a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the suggestions .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were over@@ thrown by each other , without that we had to b@@ ail .
it was not just therefore to build a simple platform , but set the steel so that it had the right height at the top or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper lights of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us will look down on the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
fashi@@ oned gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumin@@ ate the style of the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in removing theater , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
the kitchen feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance one pi@@ red units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of the Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ al space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if they are not used .
foldable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art came in , &quot; Er@@ fan was proclaimed by the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; it is important so that it is when you push the door , very light . &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agents will occur and a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and the help to create an emotional binding in a home &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterized by good design and increased square meter of slightly more standard@@ ly in something completely .
in fact , how Jo@@ anne , could you decide to leave this .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollars in real estate
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a con@@ front@@ ation for one of the greatest real estate imper@@ ial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has led him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its assets will be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have collected 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , collected since the family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family established and grew up in a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city &apos;s rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with their de@@ ceased father Colin made &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is about one @-@ third .
a judicial system said that Colin is property of $ 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the spl@@ itting of real estate and cash has proved himself for Paul as a pro@@ bl@@ ame .
&quot; the proposed by Colin proposed numbers have left him with the left , which I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial aff@@ id@@ av@@ it .
on Friday , after several failed years , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers will now fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims to have him .
Colin argu@@ ed that it is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some owners .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it which was filed by Colin , he says he will trust the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held at the law office .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , the dairy bars and del@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ ary shops in the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
you used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood li@@ fe@@ at that Colin made the first je@@ ans of the family in Colin .
Colin says that he started West at West@@ co as he was in the last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass her property for her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before Court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lut@@ is @-@ Group , with Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company &apos;s US $ 10 million and Luke 26 million were paid .
both Luke and Mark are , Paul says &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has held very well , though he was a former AF@@ L Board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ on with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it is very very sad , that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have known that Paul and I would like to vote in our current dispute , &quot; said he and added that he still hope to have a solution . &quot;
Friday seemed all hope to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin .
tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restri@@ ct the media ab@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others tried it and are failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct information flow on president Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the chief of a ste@@ ady course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , opened his first working day with senior employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he rep@@ lic@@ ated : bad news that gu@@ essed into the hands of the president .
Kelly said the employees to flow information about him - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump , closely monitoring its media .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back for decades - and now , where he &apos;s in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when the candidate was delayed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs , said the former election agent Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom at control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter is ever &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign agents perhaps know what we do not know - that dr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets without their inter@@ ventions would have been included more ignition .
we probably never read something about the Twe@@ ets which has not sent dro@@ pping .
if his collabor@@ ators have made it some time , trouble @-@ care of him , their efforts have been worth it .
but nobody knows it to prevent tr@@ ump con@@ servatory .
a part of the problem exists that people in one of the White House , which consists of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by sub@@ mitting tr@@ ump material presenting its views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - reported on this story - reported on the pre@@ ferences of an advisor to the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump civil servants say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he will find out to figure out where these are .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone contra@@ sted a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the representative of his wound in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind an he@@ aps to be at the White House .
even though Johnson was ex@@ ban@@ ished from Twitter , or that he has sold no more concrete evidence , or that he had expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to inquire about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove itself as an effective manager in Pri@@ eb@@ us , but tr@@ ump is still its im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its advis@@ ors still remains to influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make it@@ ress mission very difficult .
Mei@@ ji cr@@ ush@@ ers get post from Europ@@ ol

travelers negoti@@ ate over a h@@ ubs and return to the &apos; billi@@ on@@ ec@@ s series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house owners of the West Mid@@ lands have returned once again with some ent@@ eous travelers on war , which have tra@@ ded a field from the church to claim a field prior to their man@@ sions .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; Milli@@ on@@ ec@@ s series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they had been kick@@ ed down in May , without being qu@@ en@@ ched by one of the r@@ ushed tr@@ ench had qu@@ en@@ ched in order to prevent their obj@@ ections .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence and op@@ pressed their vehicles through a section called un@@ ob@@ s@@ ful to find a way .
the occup@@ ant inhabitants have op@@ pressed the advice of Soli@@ h@@ ull , said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they cast a stone on the fir .
the Council must be forced to work in fact , because he was using the problem with the problem .
the traveler were in May there , were moved and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to convert long sub@@ jection to protect their parks .
I live without at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to pay my municipal tax if the Council can not stop this . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of this trip to become pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you can even see a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it quickly as possible .
in order to support our wake @-@ up collection , it is very important that as possible to report many residents of a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot;
made of bir@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
out of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is opened .
the house in front of the city of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year .
that is good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotels Birken@@ hof through the then amb@@ ience of operating company mbH about 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year were lost and revenues also went through the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic numbers of refugees , which came to the County , the hotel building served as a collective accommodation that looked out for controversial discussion .
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers through the preparation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted in the church at that time .
but especially the Freu@@ den@@ stadt of Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ending the hotel site , and said already at that time of serious people interested in the house .
he was right to keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with registered office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ t has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it up to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier hotel , Birken@@ hof has been available for a longer time frame container in front of the entrance , and if you enter the house , it is clear , what extensive renovation work will be done .
the floors were taken out , ceilings to the part reduced , old tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to be done until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input range will be redesigned , new window will be built .
everything should be very close to &quot; pretty really close , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer express .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room facilities include facilities .
as a result , the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad is not positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms will wide spread across the region .
both individual groups , groups or business people are to feel at the hotel .
discussions with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se already led , so sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the investments of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer did not want to fix itself .
just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
outer plants are also placed on the front , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant that is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Poli@@ ler sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia Aff@@ air around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , he is intended to announce a special Grand Jury in a report by Robert Mu@@ eller according to a report .
the board included the work for the last weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to the people confi@@ dential .
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that it is already the first pre @-@ charge of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
US secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer than expected in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether they talked between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are expected to participate in the campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
he report@@ edly took Mu@@ eller even more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
a few weeks ago , the Washington Post published a few weeks ago that the special issue Tr@@ ump personally has moved into the centre and seek to serve the for@@ cing , whether he may disabled the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the aff@@ air .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to check the evidence in possible preventing cases and to decide whether the accus@@ ation should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called one of the count chambers .
mostly , they are turned on when larger and controversial cases are turned on .
the procedure takes place always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to re@@ charge persons under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ loaded charges were issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting are called upon a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps also consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ers as well as his dam@@ al election manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort he in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television , that the fact show that Mu@@ eller failed in his work failed , and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not be broken that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nonetheless the reduction of the committee on the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelation the President on Thursday evening an address given in West Virginia to depic@@ t the Russia aff@@ air as campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia story is a complete invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they don &apos;t have anything else that they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he wi@@ ped nothing from the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in the sal@@ ms , stressed it .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special order to &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey had three times that it was not determined against the President .
one reason I have no reason to accept that something was changed in the statement .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of these inst@@ at@@ wur@@ fs , alleg@@ ations were made against Tr@@ ump , he wants to hin@@ der the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to post an investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under great pressure for the investigation .
according to portra@@ yal of US media , the White House was collected against the Special Poli@@ cies and its employees .
the dis@@ band@@ ed spec@@ ulated about it , if Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is dismissed .
otherwise , as an independent special medi@@ ator of the congress like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air to the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller found a position in which he could be fired at theoretical time by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several transmitters of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators exhibited on Thursday bills before , after which the special inv@@ aders could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Arctic a gigantic ice@@ berg has solved from the barely seven times of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
the scientist Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Se@@ as@@ e@@ alog@@ y were shared on Wednesday .
the over one trillion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Col@@ oss pl@@ agu@@ ed to the north and probably will need two to three years until it melted .
it has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest r@@ ut@@ most iron , who have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people does not go from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the Eis@@ ber@@ ges , is un@@ clear according to research data .
however , a total of approximately 30 years , there have been an unusual inter@@ ro@@ ment of iron particles in the region , writing the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact basis .
according to many scientists , it is possible to hang together with the heating .
now the broken col@@ oss@@ ment was so far from Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is s@@ wimm@@ ers on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow steadily into the sea and regularly crash@@ es regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ do@@ is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ ice was the equilibrium of w@@ axes and stopped for some years ago .
a complete shot is to fall there , writes the A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there &apos;s some that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ skir@@ is , at risk , since the front edge is never seen as far as at present .
in addition , the ice top will be under voltage and can be cr@@ ushed in case of a piece of keys .
the melt from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg is not raising the sea level because they s@@ lows on the water , and ice cream so much water as it yields after the melting .
however , the loss of the ch@@ anc@@ er led to that the gl@@ acier appears directly into the sea and much qu@@ icker can be over@@ flowing as before .
this could possibly increase the level above sea level , however , only in a low degree , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometers .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metre thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
it regularly breaks off .
&quot; although there is a natural phenomenon , and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most comprehensive withdrawal since the start of records , &quot; he confirmed it .
among scientists were disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ skir@@ is will return or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but that development will last decades .
even though this researcher did not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic sk@@ ate iron on climate change , so in recent decades , however , a lot of polar bears on the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula are cr@@ um@@ bled .
this long stretch of Antar@@ c@@ tica is in the South America .
according to data of the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been heated by about three degrees in the past 50 years and thus forced to the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants pet service at the staff
because there is always more difficult to occupy @-@ free jobs , the CDU , out of the employer , to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has set 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there are 17 trainees their first working day behind him .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very desirable .
some 620 people were random@@ ly posted to places for this year .
nevertheless , it is still missing the circle further to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
at the moment , there are still 50 positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CDU wants to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to oppos@@ e the initiative and to oppos@@ e the professionals in the administration .
according to the parties &quot; party , the administration will work for personnel and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to meet , not just short @-@ term conver@@ sions of skilled workers , but tr@@ end@@ anger@@ ed the candidate of the candidates , means it means .
the overall concept should be based on interior and exter@@ n@@ ally , concrete measures for trans@@ missions and an apprentic@@ eship offensive do not require CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that list@@ ens to a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems , which one knew not so far .
other towns wer@@ low good officials and employees , offering more attractive conditions .
the talk is from a real &quot; competition of public emplo@@ yers . &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age due dates from the service .
highest time for action , so that no more digits remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the CDU , will continue with his party on the request of his request .
he had long gone from the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ o thick surprise when he publicly placed the personnel costs openly in question and that of the other parties .
nations wants to check all the opportunities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal emplo@@ yers .
&quot; in case of a satisfactory solution , the circle administration with the trade unions should also be able to rise to a home country , perhaps even in cooperation with the cities of the country - as well as nations .
in order to pay the CDU , the employees and civil servants are trying to pay better than the public service for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently oblig@@ atory , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you changes into a higher level which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , where employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ ching protection law .
not least through the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue
in Italy , NGOs , who use Res@@ ear@@ ers for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they are not able to continue its new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign any new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said the Minister of Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa , said .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning was a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their team worked effectively with human tra@@ ders in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
the relief organisation which has been in operation only since one year , refused to express himself in detailed anticip@@ ation of the Italian government amb@@ ience Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we can not operate in search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media .
&quot; we can all asser@@ tions that are currently raised , just after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , who has supervised I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew would take infl@@ atable ding@@ h@@ y migrants who are to be delivered directly from human tra@@ ders , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive them again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supp@@ os@@ edly found only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Prosec@@ ution whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to over@@ take about the authority of the Italian coast that rescue the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ ives .
under the conduct of conduct , boats and I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have over@@ board an Italian police officer , who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs committed to search and rescue operations have so far been willing to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessary but acceptable , because they would have no &quot; significant changes or disabilities &apos; of their rescue actions with themselves .
among those that refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate @-@ Organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue work in Italy began to decline in the last weeks that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal vig@@ il and co @-@ operation with local citizens hated fruits .
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali via measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine wi@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin foreign po@@ sten , &quot; and two guest cyclists met at Wach@@ enheim in the North Palat@@ inate , to enjoy four days long and enjoy tourist attractions .
there were three friendly Gui@@ des available .
the accommodation at Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
the look@@ out points were followed , partly over towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the Cit@@ é levels .
in between there have been longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ bun@@ ks .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s festival .
again the look@@ out point to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were again a lot of altitude difference .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and inv@@ aders were welcome .
bath@@ es in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ en the bi@@ kers in the overhead microphone of this open fridge .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the group had gotten to know the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga set for e @-@ sport
are the Sport Stars will sit in front of computer games , rather than swe@@ at@@ ted to fight the wind and the weather on the stadium ?
fact : E @-@ Sports is long since become a serious business to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative store - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high speeds .
this is also recognized by the first Federal Or@@ lig@@ n that increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to in@@ spire a brand new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says member of the Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure , &quot; that by train , some clubs are still rising . &quot;
next weekend , the football World Cup FIFA organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now established a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real soccer you must inter@@ change in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that the young people still go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the temp@@ ting to conquer all possible markets , mainly the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be present far more often on these markets , than just once a year to send the Federal Lig@@ ur@@ ian Islands to Asia .
what about it exactly ?
for the E @-@ Sport games , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the soccer simulation FIFA won at competitive level .
since ordinary sport , as in normal sport , have long been established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is surely normal .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has been dealt with the question as well .
for the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions show you can also find in classical sport , for example increased heart rate frequencies , st@@ res@@ s@@ inter@@ actions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , it does require cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the play@@ able player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ ous but also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always a theme . &quot;
controls are hard @-@ fe@@ as@@ ible in online games and in the scene were the structures of classical Sports .
the scientist raises the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are international travelling , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sports a fast growth ahead .
in 2016 , about 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , Spon@@ sor@@ ing and great tournaments .
in three years the turnover is expected to reach 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport will not be far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ consultant .
there are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate at the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ s provider Uni@@ kr@@ one .
there is also a lot in Europe .
in a Norwegian School E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , he says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league soccer league are required according to D@@ utt , in order to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany referred to as &quot; V@@ f@@ B Managing Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
only in nost@@ al@@ gia , and to clari@@ fy the ancient times , this is not enough today .
the company is to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company also set up the company at the same time .
&quot; we are living in a fully digital@@ ized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there you can not hold it , that only in football everything remains the same as it was . &quot;

Michelle Carter for the texts that Conrad Roy sentenced to suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 months of her convic@@ tion will be in jail for 15 months and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
he was sentenced to life in June due to neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy , which took to life on July 13 , 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing of his hearing , &quot; My family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both her and Mr Roy came to a psych@@ ic illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured gl@@ use , Carter frequently faced with tears in the eyes with folded hands and in the left eye , when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have been killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosecutor .
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no Reu@@ e &quot; . &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said it was a &quot; awesome surrounding , whom she was completely sorry . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mind @-@ disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
an At@@ tor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , claiming that there is no day when I didn &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved Son .
I would like to know that he is proud of me and as I go with everything . I try to bear in spite of all my sor@@ rows that we are going for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; is it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will be persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; I will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother , or a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; not to have any more this single person , with whom I have been together for my birth every day , is a pain I kept for the rest of my life always with me , &quot; said it .
the case seems to place a just@@ i@@ fying preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim his suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case referred to national attention when Car@@ ters text message revealed that she encour@@ ages him to end his life .
&quot; hanged on , spring from a building , don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that had sent them in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation .
in the sight of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &apos;s and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought the attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should take advantage of some of your press from the case .
the case is divided the legal opinion .
among the few that Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of murder of her British co @-@ inhabitants in Italy , was acquitted before two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ved compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn about the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was leaving the Audi Cup as captain of the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern will be powered by the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season with an extra motivation .
something that was different on his place in the cabin , I saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ing immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very small .
but since wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , there was no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New , he made him an assigned binding content to the arm .
&quot; the coach had not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after its first use as Bayern @-@ captain .
good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach I could also suggest that .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born as a player leader , de@@ but@@ ant and just from the holiday @-@ known professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player , but he was chosen .
sugar is spread on the most loved ones , which one wants to hold a lot in the mood .
those who have been chosen , the heir of L@@ ame , can only use a small extra motivation .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to be as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ ashing the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ lame on the field .
right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich took part in this launch as the one that can also take the ru@@ der at the best .
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ installed troops .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al thus had to play his missing fitness ( scar@@ cely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out on the Devil on the achievements of Asia Pacific ( didn &apos;t work only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus did not fall negative at their first gig in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ kot .
and all after all , it works quite well .
Sü@@ le ran aside to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y in front of the gun , both ag@@ ates su@@ peri@@ or@@ ly .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was frequent , moreover , Sü@@ ver tried to play a couple of times successful in the game construction .
in fact , his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was &quot; not that way , as we hope for this . &quot;
but he also showed a regular achievement during the debut .
gambling , speed change : &quot; for this style I was brought again . &quot;
as usual , these Bavaria world still lived for a new turn , looking forward to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
after a few cris@@ p statements , K@@ imm@@ ich talked about his new co @-@ gam@@ ers .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what happens here , I noticed now .
in Bavaria , you have to win any game . &quot;
after all this he must do no more .

business satisfied with Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises V@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
often invisible , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was even the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is after more than one year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
rooms and companies from the region speak to T V on request by a change in economic policy - and t@@ una at the same time the old ministers .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing p@@ ens the wishes of the economy , who has blocked all the Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the largest turning point for Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the bridge of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the priority list of the country up to top .
in this year , the ministry is hop@@ ed for a planning procedure , until 2021 the building is intended to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Co@@ unter Trier , which is in the pre@@ ur@@ gent demand of the Federal State website .
the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Minister spokes@@ person Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of commerce and industry ( I@@ HK ) joined Trier , as being enriched by Wis@@ sing , the wine of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the sales markets in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to form a dedicated company , commen@@ ds the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier looks at the new Master Bonus : an additional incen@@ tive for young apprentices , says manager Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
the award is provided with a premium of 1000 Euro for the ingredients of the championship and 2500 Euro , al@@ beit to graduates within ten years after the Master &apos;s training .
the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
soon to create the planned road construction of the planned road building , Jan Glock@@ auer , the chief executive director of the I@@ HK Trier will be necessary at the same time .
of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to set mobility at a state @-@ owned mobility , only 29 bodies have been occupied until now .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to external offices .
CDU Quest@@ ion@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Au@@ d@@ itors , the country of the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads .
furthermore , Frank Nat@@ us is also looking to a concept of the country to recover the attor@@ neys in the region .
in addition to the present wide band extension in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ded internet connections and ab@@ out@@ ings .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of the policy and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of wind turbines Pro wind .

Audi is going to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel cars - car manufacturers can be con@@ fron@@ ted with counter action
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said that &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; it is smart options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to provide or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles .
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as recall .
European automobile manufacturers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des to em@@ it the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturers , systems to install the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles em@@ itted by diesel vehicles , also take to what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to ignore the mighty automobile companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could adjust the use of so @-@ called ch@@ aired devices that could regul@@ ate emissions when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
several employees were indicted by Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
in the last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ares and laugh@@ ter against the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was time of one of the most widely published cartoon character strings , the cre@@ ws of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 , the Argentin@@ ian Argentin@@ ian also distingu@@ ishes itself and works in a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there are too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he defeated himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for lucky cards - what is fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded in drawing to the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .

since six years he has also been working in animation and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ is animal in its drawings - that has a s@@ wap for his opponent .
for the first time , his figures for the first time speak to the chin @-@ up wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script will not be written by him .
that &apos;s why he is putting on the TV series , which is produced like his original drawings , which is produced without .
lav@@ ender in Provence from climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the conditions that are remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases of the insec@@ ts , scientists and farmers , to find solutions to find solutions , large head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ dian , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively end@@ anger@@ ed because the plant has resulted in the impact of climate change in the past years and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacteria , the d@@ warf cas@@ ca@@ des , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it stands many at the game .
Lav@@ ender oil is not only suitable for vac@@ ation@@ ists , it is also asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ dian said , &quot; instead of very long vegetable watches with a large number of flowers , we did smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
for the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water , and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .
the little town of Ge@@ isa in the Thuring@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assassination of an journalists under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ esdays , to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ distur@@ ban@@ ces drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what you feel saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children with the office which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 or to leave them at home .
security experts have written three words at a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ als , allies .
you ask the re@@ porter to propose name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and pan@@ ic feelings .
there are drug ad@@ ug@@ gling , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no quiet period of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are frequent , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto has step@@ ped down in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter , you are publ@@ ishers and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs .
his absence will be deeply stir@@ red , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and re@@ porter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though in 2010 , a special coup was established in order to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists , only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are connected to drugs each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists is only rarely found in court .
with Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist on to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ tr@@ am@@ ous , although the terrain is still tra@@ il@@ ater@@ nal .
without inform@@ ing about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting regarding the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time into this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we do not know why , we know all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated into &quot; 12th River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius was gone away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an free of charge .
but there is practically nothing about Val@@ dez for silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans has been arrested in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January , Zin@@ al@@ oa became one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as the rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill in vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day someone or several people will be shot on the streets , or that the cemetery is full of ha@@ sted , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ oleum for drug can@@ als , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only one Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs cases in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the release of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of the rival of a rival cardboard fra@@ ctions held in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans .
this release may be off@@ ended , suspected of the crew purchased each copy of the output as soon as they delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ k .
the second mist@@ akes was to force Val@@ dez not to force , after the capture of a different newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country at its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could not be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he sold together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 U.S. dollar hol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without stum@@ bling to the Rau@@ sch@@ om issue , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time it served as a reputation for the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ est reporting , and the revenue and advertising took place .
re@@ porter loved to publish hard and hard investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories , nobody else d@@ are to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Mary @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage , in pursu@@ ing the Mexican drug history , where they always led them .
he gave will@@ ingly offered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to keep going on , he said at the CP@@ J award .
drugs in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you have to take over the job as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you say about so many mur@@ ders ? why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who managed as a port worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and suggestions , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted on his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , going on the same table there .
well , they ask : was his love for a routine to be ?
his death also has forced them to ask their own measures in question how they can do their work on the best way and staying alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their pure shops , their native start and run@@ ways , to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ scen@@ ic and self @-@ accounting .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it is wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; od@@ our has a sense to be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier runs . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others , do not apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa , as well as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ es , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training , there were suddenly no mobil@@ es . days before , Spyware , who is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
there were two polic@@ emen to protect the heat from 104 degrees Celsius ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the re@@ porter , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who are governor himself as non @-@ trusted .
it is months ago , since the re@@ porter had gone into the mountain landscape , where the Drug Administration fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
there was the murder of the former famous box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had a ex@@ pos@@ é to state spending , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that was found in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official saying about it , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally locally known by drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a re@@ porter took out public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , who ruled nearly all the political levels almost all .
recently , several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were charged due to high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ rest@@ rained the re@@ porter had to write on previous inci@@ dents in this local time , among them one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers had previously tested the column by Val@@ dez as the best informed by the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff had become something , what they had never expected : activ@@ ist in the name of the press .
Rep@@ or@@ ator Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration to an attor@@ ney at the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the Western State of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and civil servants , based on DNA tests that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists had become more powerful , pro@@ scri@@ bed in organized protests , &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on obe@@ dience and buildings .
on that day , Director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international assistance for the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary in the fall of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists and to destroy them , because they said the truth .
she has therefore sought therefore that she is divided into the government again , because she &apos;s wor@@ ried that her gro@@ ove has viol@@ ates her obj@@ ec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez was said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crime that involved government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that Rep@@ orter should not only be killed by drugs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were killed in organized crimes under a ceiling .
last year , the &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; media group received more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de obviously have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forgot the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas card : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones besides her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern state @-@ state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others are going on , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed to the drug cart@@ els with a map on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is difficult to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and seek to d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ un@@ ted , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z in three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be poet , indicates that the drug tra@@ ff@@ ed him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already completed , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce at the office were sitting in front of the office and drank beer , as all their teleph@@ ones at sum@@ mers started .
a series of shooting with band@@ ages and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan &apos;s bathing area had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the boarding ground you have published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
when it was afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the unusual founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; as you can also remember , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when Javier was assassin@@ ated on the same day that Javier was assassin@@ ated , the practitioners was asking myself to send them to the road . &quot;
tried Din@@ osau@@ rs using cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies
the first glance looks like a statue , although a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well preserved that experts were described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even determine that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was from red@@ dish Braun - and they said they would have had anything from a &apos; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology , &quot; awarded him as &quot; the holding company Din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil remains a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ ra which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ held condition has researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the pan@@ ni@@ ated plant ni@@ vo@@ res will be the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio while on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit .
he met something , what appeared from the surrounding rocks at the place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expos@@ e the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of severe pe@@ ar@@ ches .
after all these hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you blin@@ king only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it hat@@ ched , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is visible .
&quot; it will go in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers found that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a wall @-@ flowing shell , probably threatened by me@@ al@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the highly treated Din@@ osau@@ rs is a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from prey , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is used as counter@@ act , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been permitted to mix well in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts predi@@ ct that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has been made for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and named it Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours in order to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sheds and arm@@ ory of his body .
it discovered the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady , an widespread defence method in the animal , meaning that the tip of the creature was dark as its under@@ side .
although the remaining sh@@ ady is common , the results are sur@@ pris@@ ingly , as the size of the site of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta increased by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ un@@ ted enough pressure through the ni@@ vor@@ ous Din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the confusion - think of to@@ e , zeb@@ ra or belt animals - are much smaller and in@@ viol@@ ently as a prey that was sign@@ alized that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a genuine fight for survival .
&quot; strong rob@@ ber@@ tier behavi@@ ors on a massive , strongly aded din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs rob@@ atic animals of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous must have been , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ers is red .
scientists investigate further information on his life , including his preserved Dar@@ min@@ ate , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , came into a river and cast into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta were so warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more land@@ ward than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also remains in three dimensions , and the original form of the beast keeps , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
they don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ constru@@ ct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period was a time , when huge thermal @-@ em@@ itting , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous Din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two legs , went through the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ ni@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ un@@ ted from some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists believe the latest in@@ sights in the specialist magazine Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was stri@@ pped after the death in the ocean and were m@@ um@@ ified in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio while on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , pit .
according to the museum , it is the most survi@@ ving din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures had approx . 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1300 kg ) weighed .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips which ra@@ ced from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the coar@@ sely shred@@ ded plants was established through the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded in the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ers kept his arm@@ or in exquis@@ itely item detail .
the ma@@ inst@@ ated remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin tre@@ ats still cover hol@@ pri@@ ge shells along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level as the conservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see , the more I get there .
the remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ mal tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards .
I can count the scales at its sole &apos; sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ ed@@ ol@@ age A8 : many injured
strong accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 cars were involved in a massage @-@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , climb@@ s long st@@ ables , and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ ed@@ ar@@ ed@@ ol@@ age .
according to the first data on the police , 15@@ h00 between the connection stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ connected .
over the exact number of injured individuals there were no information about this .
it was just about light to moderate injuries , one of the police pre@@ fers .
a big gran@@ ting on rescue vehicles was on the accident point .
the A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilometre return journey was formed in Munich direction Munich .
like a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ way to massive disabilities - by many g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ted the characteristics of the vehicle tan@@ ker , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident happened on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ le@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a Res@@ cue driver was on the way to the accident .

the Deutsche Bahn tests are currently the potential travel ticket control .
simply confirmation by mobile phone that one can be taken place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
at present , a trial operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available on many other correspondence routes in Germany in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the road calls for the ticket sellers without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to be able to ut@@ ili@@ ze the use , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what has already done most passengers .
you must also be purchased via the app , the DB Navigator , which is why the most comfortable type of ticket booking is .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
for the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works : it grows in the train , calling his ticket by &quot; My tickets . &quot;
with the test customers the button appears to be an electronic discharge .
the train atten@@ dant to their mobile devices will receive a message that H@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and has taken the booked seating area Y .
comes the train atten@@ dant to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already available online ticket .
so you can continue to keep on , continue to keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the course - what to use for the passengers .
&quot; if you wish to travel without ticket control by our train atten@@ s , check @-@ in at the DB &apos;s Navigator simply itself .
this enables the passengers to make their travel time in the train line , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB district traffic .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
those often goes , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains , the ticket inspection are among the biggest doctors .
for often , in any case , one of all documents do not need any documentation , which is needed for the validation of online tickets .
either the card or identity card or the identity document or otherwise a document must be displayed .
the consequence are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and ride , which leads to bad mood in the part or greater area and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and Schaff@@ ner takes up the time to take care of others .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also available on the ICE Station 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same circuit are not un@@ locked .
what an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken by its core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis &apos;s building on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
she dre@@ amed over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and there is still in the street &quot; where it was there .
conf@@ using , as nobody had posted the information on their feedback , she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ched on its tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper , from the area of St. Louis , was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen , Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ f@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; he thought about himself .
but death was nothing new for her and their fellowship .
you put your mobile phone off to be back to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be their brow@@ s father , who brought a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed an Live @-@ Fe@@ ed that a polic@@ eman standing in front of a group demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ine dog .
in another video , she said , assured another police officers and cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; he remin@@ is@@ cent of their testimony .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have used to us and we can call . &quot;
at this moment I felt pl@@ ating frost .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she repeated her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of human beings living in the community and have filled the streets to request answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l possessed with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot;
they must know and see it and be drawn in it .
you have to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give you a experience in which they do not have experienced c@@ lat@@ ous rac@@ ism , it is no other than the next black women &apos;s child .
I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them far off . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a location across the police station , which was attended by a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Chief Financial Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly I began to assume a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after August 9 totally changed &quot; and she noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Master Student N@@ ose Association and focused on Essen@@ s Justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities .
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it has come all . &quot;
a few weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cin@@ emat@@ ograph@@ er Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to document &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in the meaning : &quot; would you document or tries to find a story that you can use it ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was fe@@ ed@@ itary due to countless cases of people often , often by white - in a community who benef@@ ited from their g@@ rief and her resistance .
how did Fol@@ ay@@ an declared in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not cent@@ red , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m rum around To@@ dest@@ iny .
his commitment , Fer@@ rel@@ l brought the project closer together with six other loc@@ als , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting it was shot .
&quot; this documentary isn &apos;t anyone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me as those people will be presented , because I will be presented . &quot;
the aim was to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that the movement is &quot; not around a Messiah leaders , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film .
as a result , documents reveal &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ ut life , as she loves to be married and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that this work and in the manifest@@ ation of black men have to give a certain danger . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black sw@@ elling women in the wider black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement that influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 to identify the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , pregnant women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we fight on different fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women must carry the main burden of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; the movement really kept from black women and a lot of black women . &quot;
however , it in@@ sist@@ ed that &quot; this is not a potential type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film by Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; she was the person who ra@@ ged this power , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that she was in front of the front , because with a life of these clo@@ cks than a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras have gone away into Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , but the r@@ ass@@ ischen connections have disappeared between the community and the police .
fer@@ rel@@ l is on request for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the neighborhood that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nonetheless it cl@@ amm@@ ates to a singing and she feels himself to this memory , since it went into Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss a bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern zone of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 the population in reference and opponents .
the topic hardly leaves almost one .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; is discussed the topic .
while they say a bit Gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; that would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man will need &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ags ) or quite simply : &quot; the size of Lars ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents make sure a gallery of more customers in the city , of which the other stores also benefit , fears that the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct .
in addition , the gallery is planned on the premises on which the farmers market stands , in which 13 directors are mark@@ eted its products .
it will end with the start of the construction .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - in fact , with the possibility of seating for a seated position .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling nearly weekly in the pe@@ as@@ antry market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the country are very happy .
the but@@ chers have also been discovered for us .
we would like to wish that , during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities it is possible .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ er in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the amount of rent .
this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what is the shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ser@@ y or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops available here are empty - some for months and years .
but since it is not even a regular weekly market , it is so important that at least us will maintain at least the market hall .
because after all , the mer@@ chandise is fresh@@ ly offered here , is mainly offered directly from the producers and is ob@@ sol@@ low priced .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , because the local r@@ ets are often not portable for an retailers .
too bad , special business is almost no longer and that of it is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the pe@@ asant market during the construction time ?
the old ED@@ EK@@ A would be the solution - even on duration , if the bit gallery ever comes .
or does it manage to drive from Bit@@ burg to drive all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
my view would have been better to carry out a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant mark@@ er , give it a lot more - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg does not place any place anymore .
when the pe@@ asant mark@@ thalle is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown which are almost in@@ significant - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of W@@ angen @-@ t@@ up@@ iers and hair@@ pin , which were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cut@@ outs from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ ser had an 35 @-@ year sentence , after she publicly graduated in a secret report about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline was inter@@ nat@@ ant in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sid@@ y , whose sentence was converted to Barack Obama at only three days .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithm analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits , such as any intellectual comment not only to the shape of DNA data - which can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born by Brad@@ ley Edward , but already existed since her pu@@ ber@@ ty over the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 by 20 accus@@ ations , among them six violation of the sp@@ y law , computer and theft .
through the prison its picture was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only a single photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , stuck in the Mann@@ ing very well on a passenger seat and is wearing a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde per@@ er - which it was associated with them .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced portrait portraits of strangers of for@@ en@@ sic species such as cigarette ligh@@ ters and chew@@ ing gum by using the DNA from waste to produce a picture of it like these people could look like .
that was the time when it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they brought an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany the portrait of this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and could not be photograph@@ ed at that time , therefore they took action in Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to do a DNA portrait .
the artist and her in@@ car@@ at M@@ use were sold to un@@ balance and neph@@ ew , who ruled several letters in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ orts images , &quot; which was a future fore@@ seen in which the president will see the presi@@ ding judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , they would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of fortun@@ ate agreements .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some depth and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump causes a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to solve the rigid sp@@ ans , which he actually should remedy .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , a strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery the artistic statement called the Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) an end of the &quot; automatic disin@@ teg@@ ration , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg trusted since the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific cyclo@@ pe@@ on of the artist ) how amazing similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; what people are hop@@ efully , our gen@@ ome does not take care of , who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video artwork of 2007 , Tracker Mem@@ ories is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories so that the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it dives with a free @-@ release pen in the hand of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if you ch@@ ill your speech , then they won , &quot; says it .
&quot; never content your mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll always look forward when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predicted in the Com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then she will be welcomed into the middle of the room of m@@ asks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ren , which summarized as hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
that was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human amount , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement , like the movement that were also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide lives of human f@@ hunting is a professor at North@@ western University and a employees of the University of Oxford who had been sought to susp@@ ects a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .

since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been a professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president of the university relationship , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been dead right now and was excluded from the start of the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; this is a criminal case described by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .

&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) could be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of satis@@ fying the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA @-@ road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the road@@ map to comply with the code which describes the criteria for re @-@ suspension of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing about what Russia could give an opportunity for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list criteria are certain that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results of the approved findings of the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren , publicly sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit anything , what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os did agree with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping committee .
in conversation with the Russian sales department R@@ Sport to the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but then said : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report of controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled from D@@ oping control in Russia as part of D@@ oping control centers in November 2015 .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the representative of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ eri@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves to the right direction &quot; to be used again .

A@@ my deliver@@ er wanted to measure luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent .

Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what their employees think and feel at stake in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and poll@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows the majority of the complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low performance results - so that you can drill why .

the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up convertible , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and activity , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ e@@ dit .
Conver@@ gence has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , I release Conver@@ gence &quot; pulses &quot; converting , confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the warmth card of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the managing director comes to the Supervisory Board , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ gence .
when a company is found that his collabor@@ ators are po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , workers of workers and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has Conver@@ ted for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he had to leave or send them a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was re@@ taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to trace the complaints of employees .
well , since the company has Conver@@ ted Conver@@ gence , problems that were sitting in offices in cities or states that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ loud practices are identified and addressed .
&quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who conduc@@ ts the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and disp@@ utes . &quot;
in 2002 , companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , because of ethnic violence through the En@@ ron sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; they knew that they were not able to prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology for monitoring medical eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both g@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ gence provide your software as service , and activ@@ ates the company with recur@@ ring fees for use in their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of Venture Capital investors , which will support both Start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ gence received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , where the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured a $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and made its total financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , despite the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley offers high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel in a company that pays off their voices , and that the work that you are doing , then they feel strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Tra@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Conver@@ gence as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach R@@ end@@ ite if their portfolio companies run good . companies run good when employees are working and engaged .
when the Analytics tools third parties promise , commitment and deployment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useful , if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it can anticip@@ ate that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or even at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can be dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , they must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , which has seen companies have looked at very much to collect data .
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow these people , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and who did not care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , which is now en@@ for@@ cing a monthly employee survey , was able to open measures in the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , thus res@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was re@@ organized by the rapi@@ dity of the decision and quality of communication , im@@ able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
Ruby Tuesday the company will always receive new in@@ sights about the staff , and it hopes it will be a long run of employees in a branch that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose customer also .
and if you lose customer , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers in one side of the new practice fields of the teams are talking on the campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ cot@@ t parts and show the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these unt@@ ary minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise programmes , before they will return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is for guys the next three days a real bot@@ ton , &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday was turned on Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has length@@ ens its days - at least until the finale at Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 , in order to be able to meet the players already packed in .
the compromise between the two days is more than one day , where the Bru@@ ins moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school , during Mor@@ as during the first time , during Mor@@ as , during Mor@@ as during the summer school , during Mor@@ as during Mor@@ as during the summer school .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the course of the formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ scores the rules of N@@ CAA support even if they even add another point of the number of workers .
&quot; we put these enormous loads three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they simply presses it , they pl@@ uck up on her , they are great people .
I think when we come to Saturday and we will have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate its practices once the camp has ended , resulting in view of the clear vision lines of its fields , adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class , which is already covered with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a Tor@@ p@@ fo@@ est , no light task .
Bru@@ ins player should occupy the hotel starting this weekend but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed a problem , as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far back to think that people rent there a room and then set it on it to record a exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ or of one exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t think so too much wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and their results below the original contribution , this is the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of mach@@ ined mechanical learning methods to detect possible fal@@ seh@@ ood and to send it to fact that possibly will display the results of the factor inspection from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believed that they also have the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become too a great political theme in Europe , whereby the French elec@@ tors were over@@ flow@@ ed in May with false stories , and Germany should not succeed , if it is not successful , asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement on German states that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be a test of the new facts review .
&quot; besides the knowledge that stories of fact that stories of fact the third parties want , people want to know what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to be able to test his feature under the &quot; listed Article &quot; and works on other changes to his News @-@ Fe@@ ed to decrease false news .
create a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s a hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history from its comfortable seat in the refuge River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man .
&quot; I find it so beautiful , on the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : it wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was un@@ expect@@ edly launched .
&quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a writing , which was written by a double agents in the 1700 &apos;s , which he worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck !
and letters only smell as smoke , because it was lit for a fire because of light .
for anyone who lives more than 300 years later , the od@@ our has a effect as he himself would be .
Oh , I love archive ! &quot;
for anyone who is defeated so with old pap@@ ering that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a ch@@ at@@ eau ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have a little over &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and to study the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , as about the mounted Hy@@ bs on walls and the bottles , the centuries had spent in the mo@@ at .
he walked through the land and the ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with rural conservation , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received its full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived one decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , conf@@ using it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , those who had said : &quot; it could mean that land fli@@ ppers might be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all its gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore a wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man that re@@ located the newly built Castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tum@@ ult which occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ asant uprising began in this area and I thought a insur@@ rection was a good beginning .
perhaps the two are joined together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it family , which gave the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , which is depicted in the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l of the 18th century , emphas@@ ized his own fun@@ eral that he filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was dug only after years later ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men be@@ es to be fitting the fence and spending money for things which they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men sol@@ dered their debt cr@@ ises by giving full old women in marriage - I present them as a he@@ ap good looking l@@ ads , with a talent in order to make a land@@ locked . &quot;
- After the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ se@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the site of a San@@ itary from the early 20th century , which has been res@@ cu@@ ed from nature since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle went to Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the relief of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef last Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign to give a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; asking the makers for the promotion since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we do not think ( of course ! ) really , write them on their yesterday &apos;s website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that it seems better than it seems .
basically , we are the permanent generation that we considered a bath of so@@ be@@ eing citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
at the action there is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , meaning it continues .
&quot; there is a unique promise to form@@ ulate , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able obj@@ ector feature . &quot;
eventually she was standing in competition with other municipalities .
a medium @-@ digit amount leads to the city of Bad Honnef their new umbrella brand and the campaign cost .
military training in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es about retirement and promotions in officer cor@@ ps .
so this week also .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no more in the building of Staff , as previously , but in the office &apos;s office of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the government , the five Deputy Group as well as the ministers for Defence , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
that was the number of civilians in the Y@@ as .
the government re@@ loc@@ ates the re@@ ins in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were depos@@ ed .
since the failed Cou@@ p State Secretary of Staff 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleged connections on the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as wire drawing of the coup .
around 486 people who have been involved immediately in the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day following the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an was named as &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; because he was giving him the opportunity to cleanse the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an really have the handle in the handle ?
at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet Zeitung &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the Staff , there is evidence for an increasing &quot; Islamic &quot; Army , which manifested themselves among others in the abol@@ ition of the Federal Institute for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the most un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess in the army and the security forces continues to go on .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an de@@ pri@@ ved another 73@@ 95 arch@@ ers , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
in this way it seemed to have been gro@@ unded to the military .
the gener@@ als are earlier than the actual lor@@ ds of the country .
three times she embar@@ ked on his role as a gu@@ ardi@@ ans of world leaders .
after its election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least recently under calling for reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an imp@@ lied on specifically a Islam@@ ism of armed forces .
in the Voc@@ al Europe magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , seeking for asylum from persecution abroad , seeking Turkish army within a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this NATO would not get cold that NATO could not get cold .
there is no doubt in the alliance to the pur@@ ge of doubt at the work of the Turkish army .
leaders and operations are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US @-@ migration plan to change the rules of Green Card , president Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
it looks before , to reduce the legal immig@@ rate to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for travel permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will decrease poverty , and increase wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do that by the U.S. will change the way , as the citizens from other countries will be given to Green Cards . &quot;
the law will avoid the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have English speaking to support the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge to come to our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from American media .
Ministry wants to make route for racing shuttle
back in the past few months , more than the future of the racing car body was fought , and it is expected to go quickly .
even before the end of the year the tour is scheduled to be built on the tourist road .
in order to secure the future of the racing department in the long term , according to the traffic of the public Department , construction work is expected to begin on track in this year .
&quot; with the decision to order and to order the stretch of Ilmenau @-@ racing further , the country knows that the country is especially important for tourism , declared the traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the route has been reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
this sum will take 75 percent of the country .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , is currently being matched at the moment , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Office of the operator acts as a operator for technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map used in the vehicles and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
the race @-@ shuttle service will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the race @-@ back @-@ Shuttle is an especially popular train connection between the Ilmenau @-@ and racing railway stations .
in the past months , in the course of a pilot project , the route has been widely used by plenty of people to order in the future again .
the distance is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex @-@ Ro@@ bots is real and we should worry about to worry about
just when you thought there will be not yet crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments within the field of sex robot .
yes , indeed .
sex robot are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start to take up their ascent .
customers can choose the eye Color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ es .
&quot; the people have fun about it , but the company deliver any amount of it , and we will be able to see them more often more common , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report .
modern sin@@ u@@ ators have developed from their infl@@ atable partners with a silicone skin that feels warm , with deliber@@ ately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robot also according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and thereby select all from the eye color of the robot about the form of breast war@@ ts to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ gel .
but it will still be wor@@ qui@@ eted because many robots acknow@@ ledge the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; which would look like a Step@@ ford &apos;s wife .
modern sco@@ ot@@ ers have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt their users to the properties that are eng@@ aging to the properties like ti@@ mid .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre@@ programmed personal@@ ities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality which makes your personality as good as possible , &quot; is war@@ med to the Website of True Compan@@ ion .
you may like what you like , and she don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
she has also kept its mood during the day - as real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be fixed &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the under@@ stand@@ able female properties that occurs on rape if one step towards van@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resist@@ ed ) Far@@ rah , be@@ ck@@ down one in most .
on his Website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website .
however , these sex robot wasn &apos;t just a fat or just a different sex@@ ist .
their emergence or its increasing refin@@ ement refer to a slightly dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal solution of Gender Equality to a wish of sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , have no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R indicated their rising popularity , they still remain provis@@ ionally on the fr@@ inge of consumption culture .
but what caused the mar@@ g@@ inal zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or revi@@ ved , until the free market is given for this .
there is a certain persu@@ asi@@ bility that these high @-@ developed sex robot in a time immersed in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which it gives an president in the White House , who thus talked to have women attacked .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Cra@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos;s &apos; ) are not the graphic images that appears swallowed up , but as realistic this vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it feels like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robot is to make physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
your gro@@ wers w@@ anting to feel human being , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point if it is about their &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; the robots represent no real women .
they are not able to separate or walk away from her companion .
they have no placement or a background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of the imagination .
otherwise stated : you are fal@@ sely slaves .
or to express it in the spe@@ ech@@ es of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps huge performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the attack of healthy human beings
it is turned into a suppor@@ ter trial of Tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political sp@@ ans , which have polarized the U.S. elec@@ torate , have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ ets were in the USA newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump @-@ selected relations .
we strain us all supp@@ os@@ edly to allow our filter bub@@ bles .
it has been reduced less than the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famil@@ ies .
I have chosen this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directional slide show in Chicago , has long been working with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who has visited me in New York for a long time .
they remembered that unity against a common enemy could have a mighty effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally on the same side .
in order to the dining table , there is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this is also substantial risks .
the line was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of its Presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ill@@ ful possibility that our bi@@ b will not stum@@ ble in a day .
there is , however , there is still lack of long @-@ time scenario in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans the right wing of the right wing &quot; normal@@ izes , &quot; which appear at once in comparison to his standards suddenly .
I found myself today by an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , the dog on the car roof , which looked after 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how its tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact , as a very mild off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sel of the New York parking department , and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city when there is no caffeine needed .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs in the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoul@@ ders - extremely fin@@ ster and climate @-@ friendly music convey@@ s this on a notable manner .
so many clubs have dis@@ appoint a city : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer a lot of exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city will not be justified .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not far beyond the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the themes of Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the North of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could rate the Kar@@ us@@ sell , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked him .
on the other hand I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of 5 to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .

Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain out of the prison hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ gh to the hospital , which he suffered , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of appeal against an appeal of prosec@@ uting the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys for Mor@@ ning .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in early morning hours of Valent@@ ina 2013 , taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tly inv@@ ocation , which hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appeal , of which they say to op@@ aque .
the National Prosec@@ ution Authority reported that it would be lifted up at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is the danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
a strange egg finds a strange egg
as the last of the Bul@@ berger schools , the four t@@ ug@@ ly ans from fen@@ ders and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dismissed in the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the in@@ scriptions go to school , four at school , four at the secondary school .
school gui@@ ding Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , Germany .
the 29 pupils of the four classes of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grows in chickens , but then released to freedom .
to this end the m@@ ack@@ z@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and brought it out of its h@@ ens .
a small eagle was instead of a chicken egg .
but hop@@ ing that the eagle was spread out of the chicken , the e@@ ag@@ les spread its wings on a high mountain and spread out the wall .
after that , classes were three and four in the studio of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank had a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens dance with the young Go@@ ck@@ les that bare the cylinder to the bet .
the e@@ ag@@ les arise for the integration , said deb@@ tor Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
indeed , the young is different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but it &apos;s true .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his appointment is to be free .
they wish every quadru@@ ped feeling that he feels at his new school .
it was followed by a word to colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who jumps back to the l@@ ender position again , and the par@@ ental representatives .
the ch@@ icks time now be over , explained Class Te@@ ach@@ ers Sophia Schumacher .
she nour@@ ished her students after two years of instruction only very un@@ fortun@@ ate , because it was a really great time .

software update for diesel vehicles : what do they need to know now
how accurate is the software update ?
must diesel engines be participating in the action ?
the most important questions and answers to the overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group has offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emission behavior of cars of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the handled software updates are optional .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin .
the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) ordered its re@@ arm@@ ament .
how and after when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a fast conversion in the next few months , but still does not have an exact date .
Daimler has forwarded to write every person concerned .
if you require an inspection , it will be done in their frame .
how long will the conversion arise totally ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the in@@ consist@@ encies of the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen that the car manufacturers are not so far at the topic of the environment . &quot;
how long shall the update take ?
in the workshop only three to four hours could last .
time will be able to get an appointment .
what can drivers do , which do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE obli@@ que to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would draw , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but to the regions where the group is thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE obli@@ que to wait for sale yet .
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most beautiful events in Washington .
the first prize was presented by President Tr@@ ump , to become polit@@ ically polit@@ ically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the prestigious awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution of the Thursday was announced in this year , singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join us with his wife Mel@@ ania on the Award .
the winner of the Le@@ ar Progressive TV series announced that he had already announced the participation in the gala &apos;s gala .
&quot; the New York Times , &quot; he said : &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lec@@ ting the arts and human rights - even neg@@ lec@@ ting them - and they imp@@ lied me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that they will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to consider their visibility .
after the former president John F. Kennedy named Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .

we make the city li@@ fel@@ ong
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ master , continues in the next year in R@@ ente .
the passage is already written - suitable applicants are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker is the h@@ acker .
and the work is still great for him , as he was medi@@ ated in the Press Conference .
he reports varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , we wonder that there is no application to request the desired profile .
the town is looking for the closest potential of an architect or building engineer .
so - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of regular participation periods - still enough time for training .
since Has@@ lach worked for the administrative community as a sub@@ contrac@@ tor , the candidate must demonstrate respective contracts .
for this function does not want to keep the city any case .
wouldn &apos;t fill it any more , you would have to leave citizens to open until Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office there have gathered some important projects to look back on W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , a varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ und parking lot are infected .
the Kin@@ etic @-@ Bridge is renewed between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach , also the stadium is still subject to theme .
the latter alone will strike with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design skills be present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of large bac@@ kl@@ ash .
with ha@@ v@@ ester &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be flexi@@ bly acted on a multi @-@ flexible way .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the creation of green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors often .
since the old town are as ensemble of monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have prepared , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the leaving Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ master carries high responsibility .
he is builder , &quot; at the end , everything goes on my table . &quot;
for care and coordination he can count on many years of experience : Markus St@@ ai@@ er ( High construction ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep building ) has been around for 15 years .
even so that his successor is long wishes : &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really identified and stay with the job . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city .
whoever wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker is to tell information about the town of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with specialised architecture in the fields of building application and planning permission .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ d building under construction and civil engineering , planning planning , real estate agencies , administrative building , municipal property with building yard and municipal court as well as under monument protection agency including monument protection .
bike on lines are thrown : southern line blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown cycl@@ ers had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so strongly damaged that the prev@@ ailing freight lift had to be left .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rators and are looking for the night seasons after them .
near the Tat@@ ars there were witnesses a thr@@ ott@@ est es@@ se@@ er and a bike driver .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ sier , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch said to A@@ PA .
the or the perpet@@ rators were brought in danger themselves into large per@@ il and also end@@ anger@@ ed by train .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , and the delay &apos;s delay and the costs for rail transport , more @-@ ray of railway customers may also come to the perpet@@ rators .
all in all , the subject was told by a &quot; considerable &quot; sum &quot; says the subject .
the damages were fixed to Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south line could be guided without disabilities .
a fri@@ day of ten staff were unusual , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they had delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of surface had to be replaced .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate can help to lin@@ king IB@@ D ( anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel )
red meat and chocolate can capture your digest@@ ive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could reduce symptoms of patients with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the un@@ holy state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , caused mag@@ nets and bli@@ sters , recur@@ ring or bloody injuries , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
as those affected normally , meat and dairy products have come to avoid their symptoms , researchers found in the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins were to develop , that promote toler@@ ant immun@@ ity , that promote toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immun@@ ity cells in the intest@@ ines were pat@@ rol in order to make sure the harmful micro@@ bes that enter into the body do not enter into the body .
cells that are im@@ able to trigger inflamm@@ ation , protect cells and protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too much inflamm@@ ation in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can cause infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments I found that a type of tolerance @-@ carrying immune cell in mice , which bear a particular bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ias art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an who had mice in their food , the more they had them from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L &apos;@@ reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ated , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal wor@@ sen@@ us , if the same system will work with humans .
the post @-@ doctoral degree in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan sought a kind of immun@@ ity , which was found out that a group of study group had such cells , but one other group of the same tribe that was not accommodated , but had not had to be accommodated .
it assumed that the difference to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and were found in six bacter@@ ias which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were removed in a steril@@ ized environment , so that they were not developed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al and they were not developed these kind of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immun@@ ity cells .
in order to understand how the bacter@@ i@@ fies to the immune system , the researchers left the reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then brought small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid has been cleaned , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ en@@ ings were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that humans have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us would protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an add @-@ by products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i to develop cells in people such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote because these cells control inflamm@@ ations at the inner surface of the gut .
potentially high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to a broad@@ ening of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had made his debut at Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million Po@@ ckets signed by Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impres@@ sing in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the blues tour of the blues tour of the blues for 45 minutes and managed to make Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho only 45 minutes later , that he had to improve at the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way , as he think - he considers football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready in former times . &quot;
besides M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho won his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent unveiled this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho loved three further re@@ adily available , but it in@@ sist@@ ed that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four previous re @-@ agreements .
&quot; three of four of them I added to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happy if they get four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has created the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and drew from the form of a dre@@ am@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
in the radar screen it was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made this advertising earlier .
the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo was painted in the sky .
new tide for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
like the wind twi@@ sts : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still pointed out by the SPD , S &amp; D minist@@ ered to a certain concern in Berlin .
naked no dis@@ rup@@ tions from Party central , merely no counter wind out of the federal government - this is the most important desire of voting dam@@ pers .
since Martin Schulz heads the party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus is characterized by an aston@@ ishment the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ained state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , its head@@ wind would not be described above .
there were deep signs .
and indeed one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Green Party have a significant majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; this one shows even more : red @-@ green can not be ug@@ ly gro@@ unded , &quot; he said CDU General Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprise leader of a Green @-@ elected president , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their voices to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP &apos;s opposition .
the green @-@ German managing director Michael Kell@@ ner sum@@ mon@@ ed to return the char@@ itable Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ sar , to return to their mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear f@@ ake of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ ent must immediately return to Mand@@ ate , &quot; said the Federal Minister and Ele@@ ction of the Gre@@ ens of the Gre@@ ens Network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; that &apos;s not all true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the floo@@ ding of the green J@@ ke T@@ ent to the CDU without their own government .
it is the preliminary cli@@ max of a whole rows of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ er started a significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more f@@ ading , the com@@ rades involved .
everything will be different in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
it was then - and everything was well worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD in the st@@ roll , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smooth .
lab@@ ori@@ ed , the com@@ rades re@@ formed in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just had exhau@@ sted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came from Hamburg .
and with him the next dr@@ au@@ r@@ ash came .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD farming , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his town .
and because in crisis communication , then everything that is wrong , what can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
well , Stephan Weil , too .
because of the VW emission aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for longer .
les@@ ions were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just therefore , because in the past few weeks , Weil still tried to set acc@@ ents in the federal government .
the taxation of the former Mayor of Hanover , made up his power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him give , since they promised a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because of this there is no gu@@ ilt because of the party &apos;s internal forced law@@ less@@ ness .
and Schulz doesn &apos;t know .
while the gen@@ ders are due to stop , the com@@ rades must be closed in order to keep their own rows .
their wrath adap@@ ts to the green , and here especially on the revol@@ ving par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ sar .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ cies , such as Mrs. T@@ arran@@ ges their own career on interests of all other countries , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of part@@ itions in the SPD Bundestag and the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ arran@@ t was not elected to Parliament by her person as a direct @-@ candidate , but on the national list of Lower Saxony for the Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that it returns to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Head of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who has led the Lower Saxony as a top candidate in the Bundestag election of the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he demanded to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more , or passed apart from the CDU Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ors for the village III
if you want to cancel his house in the years , it will get out of the country soon .
on Wednesday , the Mayor of Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative - Ste@@ g Urban Development on Wednesday in Sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again issued a review of this date .
since 1991 , there was a sensation in Sens@@ ations .
back then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg adopted two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous san@@ itation are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only to develop new building areas .
on April 4 , 2005 , the government of the government of Karlsruhe will receive information that there will be a re@@ organisation .
the total amount amounts to 8@@ 33 333 Euros , 500 000 of which come from the country , the rest of the community .
how does a san@@ ction process now arise ?
one will go on , so Sch@@ in@@ dler further investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area of interest , to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
if necessary , the territory &apos;s borders may then move again .
the pi@@ g compet@@ ed on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ h .
cellar presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the san@@ itation would then be carried out .
core of the program are the revol@@ alization of internal cities , improving the residential and work@@ space and maintain and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures were drawn on objects , that means per plot , carried out .
finally , the re@@ organisation would then be defined as a statute .
the encour@@ agement period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , only the existing inventory would be carried out , as part of those involved in the san@@ itation region involved a questionn@@ aire .
as possible , as possible , the proposition is scheduled for November or December , so that in the coming year with the renov@@ ations can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann followed that every commune had to carry out pre@@ defined advance investigations .
it is about to evaluate the urban con@@ cre@@ ations , and decide where to be rehabil@@ it@@ ated and in which gir@@ th .
it will then be entered in the field book for the respective plot as well .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would come again after sensation and make a picture of the location , promised them .
Got@@ h stressed , an important success factor for the project is to be the participation of the parties involved .
therefore it will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; Building and Property Office &quot; where it is among others around the building state and re@@ organisation views .
in the grey Quest@@ ionn@@ aire , the &quot; House@@ - and Resi@@ dential House &quot; , information can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential area .
the blue &quot; s bow &quot; is only filled out when the business premises are operated .
however , indeed , Got@@ h pointed out that a questionn@@ aire should not be applied at the same time a request for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding is functional after the &quot; wind @-@ principle &quot; - who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you cannot reserve no conveyor belts for later &quot; . &quot;
as a result , photos of the project &quot; Local II &quot; was shown in order to make a restoration &quot; tasty . &quot;
British inventor puts a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so he can open his door , and even with a hand movement can start his car .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and index fingers and now offers service for businesses and individuals who wish their lives with technology through the company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he graduated together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ a@@ esth@@ es@@ ist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure will be carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now been installed at home as well as with his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm .

the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy helicopter to the South La@@ wn an event that yields the American manufacturing last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost after the information of the military , by the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the built in Connecticut has been exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire fighter from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House of White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I only wanted to know that , because there is an unusual event with great visibility , &quot; the Commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of the pre@@ set , the Deputy Nav@@ al Command for Aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 pm and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would need for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours .
during the event , the original air@@ crew was under the helicopter while security personnel remained on the plane while the airplane remained on the plane .
the records relating to the TI@@ ME was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the National Bank Act has given the Federal Government to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked if the event may hurt .
&quot; one question that we asked if there was an injury to the Brands Hatch and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; he wrote Commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the Deputy Command@@ ant .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political upper tones .
on the event , the president responsible for reform of healthcare reform that was in the Senate in the Senate and prop@@ aganda efforts to sei@@ ze the government regulations .
the use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from polit@@ ically advant@@ age@@ ous purposes .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for travel .
but your use only for photo OP require , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump resulted in a survey in February when the Presi@@ dential airplane before the back@@ drop of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ om@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services provided , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential vessel through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries shows that by American workers with American materials , said the deputy press agent of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to depos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led up in the White House 58 exercise sessions .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted the training requirement of the crew for the month , said an official .
in addition , Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support com@@ missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers have no load for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in doing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have Bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the Federal Ministry of Defence in the Ministry of Defence in 2017 , the Do@@ D proceeds for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the plane records the flight time of the airplane as 30 minutes from the home @-@ base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers is determined on the basis of estimates for renewal rates , is highly respected , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance , and many other hidden costs that are included in the funding . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the workshop sets for Do@@ D not included the personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ending the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things out in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they can contribute to our national security , and I go from that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have had un@@ ti@@ ring .
it is of course reasonable , emphas@@ ize it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ned with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the passenger seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House Tr@@ ump on representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ elled with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
peak re@@ iter of the Second Tennis league will compete with the table third Su@@ pper SV .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the table third Su@@ pper SV .
despite the five games , the mac@@ er@@ one has still gained the sense of the Second World War in the Second World War .
team manager Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay still has respect to the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays always in a similar formation .
straight on the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the SV s@@ ander SV , especially the imports from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point out at the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; Z@@ ay said with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andr@@ e G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will always be hard for us .
there you also need a good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ der@@ ers team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white might be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
at the moment the ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella is not the Bundesliga match for the Bundesliga , which is playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ p@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski on the ball court in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
it should be in Kiel but also as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ bl@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgium , Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on the last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z also came back into the team .
it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was only one of the junior World Ran@@ kings in January 2016 , if anyone comes from the Train@@ ee by Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay .
how America can harm the OMV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he sat on Wednesday evening under the law to off@@ end the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his case , &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Moscow , the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels p@@ ou@@ sted around the US subur@@ ban .
after all , the draft proposes to pen@@ alties European companies that help Rus@@ sians help to build gases in the EU .
in accordance with that date , investors have been financed to investors of domestic OMV , co @-@ financed with other European firms the construction of the Russian Baltic sea line Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is massive .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of consequences , as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions still by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available for him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at which the Group could im@@ pe@@ de and which really could do it .

roll back@@ ward : the city represents 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch break back again .
with fixed support partners for children and an assignment to the team .
in urban kinder@@ garten , the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take care of food care in the urban kinder@@ garten ( Kit@@ ts ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Sub@@ st@@ itute in the Department of Youth A@@ id , is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
it is still cooked by house : a cat@@ er@@ pillar takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs in the area of 46 children &apos;s day@@ workshops , in 44 the babies get a hot meal .
in the last Kit@@ a@@ year there are 2,@@ 800 children at the tables , and the needs constantly grows .
&quot; meanwhile , there are not only children who are taken care of 45 hours in the K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz is explained .
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children remain until 14 am . &quot;
46 Part@@ itions workers from the 1st of September : take up the delivered foods , supplement it to prepare salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate food , cleaning the meal , rinse well , rinse well and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are allocated to a c@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed groups , just like si@@ onal groups - decides on the circumference of the car .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; so they are much stronger . &quot; it &apos;s easier for the hospital , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because this is why you are healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children are supposed to help the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force of the team is meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the k@@ ita rooms - previously also task of kitchen tra@@ itors - will be settled in the future by special cleaning fees .
this version - the split of cleaning and kitchen services - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm , which they presented themselves in cost @-@ equal between own reg@@ im@@ ents and foreign languages for the city as the most economic efficiency , it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 parts are new .
&quot; but these hours are not so strong for about 750 people in the educational field , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz says .

G@@ MB @-@ concern on investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ia factory in Glasgow
a union wishes to join forces of the bis@@ c@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over the long @-@ term commitment to the production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had held about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant in addition to other products Hob@@ i and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owners Pl@@ adi@@ s said that he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced &quot; if its activities were going to change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s called on &quot; concerns &quot; concerns expressed that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ iser Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win out of the General Site Manager no clarity on the needs of business and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , aff@@ ecting our members .
generations of families have been working here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area of high unemployment and social experiences .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosper@@ ity , and from the back@@ drop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising health management costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow is strongly recommended for Mc@@ Vit@@ ie .
a spokes@@ person on Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross took only yesterday a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to their employees as we estimate the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees we are like all the companies working in an extremely competitive intensive and in@@ secure economic climate , our stores constantly check - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; in the last few years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and very much . should our operational processes will change at the location , the staff and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G stay warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La Liga is your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave the persecution of N@@ ey@@ lon , after having accepted an offer of £ 189 million to resolve his free release date , but they warned Barcelona before the world record .
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous mark , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season .
after the completion of N@@ ey@@ mar to the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athl@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry with the way , such as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board decides that the club has always given its best to worry about his coming from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the soccer world warned about three years ago from the PS@@ G President ?
when Manchester City 2014 has been interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned , because they touch one of our players , then we will be able to stand in opposition to them , and we will contact their players &quot; , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , this consequences will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded these line with the Spanish association in early summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly accounted for that they would not allow to travel to the International in Italy , in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking part of her price for N@@ ey@@ mar .

in the area of the city of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car was met on his road lane , so that he had to turn out to the right .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen press release Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report about the abuse of the Pope was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael E@@ emann .
the final report of the ab@@ norm@@ ch@@ al sc@@ and@@ al in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain provides further discussion on discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ person for the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he earned a debt of Pope Benedict XVI as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Benedict XVI .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger would pro@@ hibit their deep sub@@ missions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes .
in contrast , the Pre @-@ law firm &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that during reporting on violence with &quot; two measures &quot; measures .
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , there is no one that it would have to prevent &quot; dirty and damaged acts , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the acc@@ ust@@ omed to mark the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Princess of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one would like to go on to the church and that &apos;s a bo@@ unded fres@@ co . &quot;
in addition , it pointed out that in her adolesc@@ ence &quot; Schl@@ ust had been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to be ready to become ready . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to use today standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about mis@@ use cases , Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was also available .
it is entirely wrong , author and historian Michael E@@ emann , who written with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My brother of Pope . &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to put Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that from the Bish@@ op@@ ric of Regensburg , with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber , presented ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain were sexually viol@@ ated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ vity &quot; victims of overweight people , 67 Dom@@ estic damages .
in the final report , it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , saying : &quot; summar@@ ies that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
just at high E@@ Mot@@ onal@@ ity the punishment for students could also be violent .
contrary to many other documents , many victims were estimated to reflect the general crimes of humanity and therefore , in many cases , it is even positive and positive memories with it . &quot;
in an interview , E@@ emann , why the final report of the Cel@@ est@@ ial cathedral of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Inci@@ dents of Non @-@ violence against the Dom@@ en@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for an lifting many students , out of their &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears to be used as Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , even if a domain sp@@ ice has no top performance .
how do you achieve this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask oneself rather , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
to him , eight pages are devoted to him and it is clear from any suspic@@ ion or co @-@ violent in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the force of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside its operation sphere .
you can take him all if it is too late or first accus@@ ations not taken seriously .
the cathedral @-@ vac@@ an@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium in which he worked , was taken from practically all those question@@ ed - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; sky &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , describes it as &quot; hot @-@ heart@@ ed &quot; , &quot; very popular , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; under@@ stand@@ ful &quot; , as extremely high @-@ level teachers , who provided boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons and had always been surrounded by grapes of children .
only a minority is compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high motiv@@ ity that led to wi@@ l already times .
he did not just cast only with chairs and cast the keys and on the floor , but also , ear@@ ing guys on the hair , or ears , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted that he was sorry , and ow@@ es to it .
however , to his honor , however , such educ@@ ators have to be widespread in the un@@ question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely used , with parents as well as teachers .
do you know even such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gram@@ mar school .
compared to what actually happened in this report , namely , to escape sexual abuse and violence at the pre@@ school , they are fre@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
this one asks , whether they were not rather to do with his acquain@@ t@@ iness and his role as a brother by Benedict XVI , that many media have just fell on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood it , still ei@@ v@@ elled .
but the truth is : the report relief Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in all respec@@ ts !
in the media this report was reported much about mis@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ no@@ ons in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is placed in the final report any processing or mit@@ ig@@ ship with regard to sexual abuse on load ?
Michael E@@ emann : totally no . no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never knew that , with my father or my mother , &quot; I said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the declaration of sexual abuse was and is , however , most victims from shame silent .
if they did not have parents and si@@ bl@@ ers , then quite definitely not a ch@@ orus master , who yet have been a certain colleague of the perpet@@ rator .
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students &apos; R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael E@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated this way : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have had tim@@ ely in@@ sights and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , assume that ... Bu@@ ying ur@@ gent or clear@@ er , or rather , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ra@@ fts , confi@@ denti@@ als , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus the report says to the very clear result : &quot; that in advance of the affected pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the examination . &quot;
aff@@ ecting sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is talking about everyone .
thus it cannot be accused him , not prevented or transferred to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these terrible crimes , as it was in some cases .
in the media was much of &quot; violence to read &quot; during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ no@@ ons .
the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is being thrown in the &quot; sign@@ posted &quot; report .
must he live with this design ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and men@@ tions to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the gram@@ mar school , between sexual abuse and violence , we say even , other occasions .
Moreover , the report has been treated from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ orus of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
the full horri@@ ble test education , the cases , in which boys from sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were regularly ashamed and had trained , happened at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ ill@@ ous states must have dominion .
yet , with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only on his face , as they were already at the nas@@ ium @-@ set nas@@ ium .
on that , as the very most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
it was only happy to be coming to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ es &quot; states .
what was different at the nas@@ ium @-@ n@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium ?
Michael E@@ emann : since there was discipline but no seasonal violence .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general crimes of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
so no more the alleg@@ ation remains in the front .
yet , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported to him from the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and carried out by the predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not been active and responsible , ( as the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
shut down Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from the states consistently the ears ?
Michael E@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nas@@ ium , which was even re@@ produced .
in this respect , he pointed out that in the incident , the exam@@ ining penalty will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative press coverage he inv@@ as@@ signs ur@@ gent effects .
this was of course , at a time as legal clarity , as a test bre@@ wing had been banned in Bavaria since .
before that , it took in a legal gre@@ y@@ zone , just as everybody knows about us .
it was too much appreciated for him , where the affected may have been ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dra@@ fted , and where the ad@@ missible line had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have failed .
that is not so easy .
only in 1980 the testing of the schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
Princess of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is maintained yes , it was in@@ fair to use today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards on that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael E@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger that per@@ taining to today &apos;s mor@@ ale &apos;s standards .
there has been the princip@@ ality in law .
but this is true of course not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ h@@ able to all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school on resist@@ ors and violence to innocent children , that goes far beyond that .
this is all awesome and I &apos;m glad that it is finally re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I have to put Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the same time , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and Pun@@ ishment , so ear@@ ing and listen to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment then was forbidden , it also kept strict about it .
what is the picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time created Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope . &quot;
came the topic of DU@@ T in the language too ?
Michael E@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells its perspective , as the Cathedral spar@@ rows played a side part .
nevertheless , I did not conce@@ al that he led a str@@ ingent reg@@ iment to there .
but also this must be said to be once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , it would have hardly been possible to form any nationally known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen a institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador Europe and his musical tradition , which went to tour two times in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone one makes out of rebel@@ li@@ ous child once more big singer and in front of any success , just in which area , but still discipline , passion and sel@@ f@@ ishness .
as what a man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks about their book ?
Michael E@@ emann : thanks to work on the book and beyond that I really learned George R@@ atz@@ inger , and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ or@@ ful , fundamental , deep @-@ believers and heart@@ y people , from which one could not imagine that he could do anything just a fly ?
I regularly get acquain@@ ted with how many former domain names are still alive today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency Policy , attend to him regularly to inform him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him today that he was strictly speaking to them , are therefore unique in the minority .
most of them are grat@@ eful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always is a good , v@@ u@@ ter@@ nal teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but nevertheless a favorite respec@@ t@@ ful thing , to which they still watch it and honour them .
and , once again clearly stated : everything that were given to him are educational methods that were then on the agenda .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time since .
but it &apos;s most un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother has become a medi@@ al sin @-@ bo@@ ck .
there is the evil int@@ ent that stands behind him only too .
for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves it .
now the state of affairs would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its without being outside of Bavaria and maybe in Germany , nobody would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
