<seg id="1">Munich - 1856: four cards that change your view over the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A wander Anstalt, where youths should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A greeting on which is dug up for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the influential reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sucks when maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows what had to be furious, because the car navigation was given a green grass instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, a supply of the Geoport of Bavaria within the state government, are all other than currently - but just very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current Online Cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the cities and municipalities in the area of Munich has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flip-carpet, which one can't know as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map for cities and communities with more detailed maps, so-called deciduel leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was created according to the Bavarian surveyance administration between 1810 and 1864, and skip the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon called an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops arrived at the peace of Lunéville from February 9th, 1801: there were the current neighbours, who created the idea of a widespread Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" and thereby the Bavarian State Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate of Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the Bayerischer Lloyd's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the spring / day is the example of the capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town has expanded in all directions and grew up.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the undersendling that dips a relatively isolated map in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shipwreck was created 21 years after the map of the map, i.e. 1877, at Munich's suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today there is undersendling in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the shelter is located around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named only 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers uprising against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing as a fields - at first glance: in the zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "uranium," from which the property is derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots have no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, which had been the scene of the October 1810, was indeed a meadow, and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar there is a historical map an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the jungle, you are reading in the district of today's Au-Haidhausen's name "at the bronce" or from the height "At the fan" - but also in great letters "mistaken Anstalt".</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the auction field they once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">It was established here in 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer fans."</seg>
<seg id="34">Beginning in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the establishment of a psychiatrist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and finished for example the so-called wl of the so-called mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he says the staff, violence against its occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">The first number of 280 patients was first place, later was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatric atrics.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, youngsters meet at the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920, and turned it into a youth center with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the soccer field of the TSV Munich Ost, east of houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built by 2015 in an architectural rejection to the origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during World War II.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was named as "Main Square" in 1856, called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change was in the Second World War even at the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allied Forces in December 1944 had many holes in downtown.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a tomb in the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn route.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill in the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Published Travel Guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Fares has issued a warning for colour people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminating politics and the racial attacks of the state of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will come into effect by August 28, 2017, invites afro-American travellers, visitors and missourceans, since a series of unquestionable, road-based incidents in the entire state and here will be noted," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A newly published law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state that undisproportionate minority groups, adverted the group to release traveler's rice, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have the injuries of civil rights to happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are treated because of their skin colour, they will be put together or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group cited incidents like racial violation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the early days of unquestionable circumstances, after that he had no more petrol during the journey through the state, and was taken away by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recently published report of the Office of the General Attorney of Missouri, in which black drivers will be more common in the state 75 per cent more common than the whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that the people are aware of and about their families, friends and employees, what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"the people must be willing to bring it to the ship or the relatives have to know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded in the year 2015 100 Hasselt, according to the latest figures from the Hasselt, the FBI, which entered the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is also a reply to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had published travel agencies for Texas and Arizona, the local authorities undertake to pledge people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the conclusion of ACLU to further road profiles.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travellers are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in the last time advocacy groups have made the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is Elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The heredacher electric fence project is a success project and is continued in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag basslands Peter White and Kordula Kovac had an image to be found on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the excavation yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the heredacher CDU Association joined the Association of Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwennmann first granted insights into his operation, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 acres of forest cultivated, 40 dairy cows and as many youngsters served and accomodate in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest's milk" is the alternative way for him for the milk of his cows, as part of Schwennmann.</seg>
<seg id="73">The table of holiday guests is exclusively Regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also a BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the electric fence project as "Elementar important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not generate profits on real steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green land care for much work, a lot must be machined with the sense sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the terms and conditions to fight with the topography," stressed by Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the farm and took management of these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not lead a biosier.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, he was clear: "the community has recognized the importance of the fence projects and is glad for the leader in funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers are required at costs between 3000 and 4000 Euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the evacuation of the surface could be gone out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and do thoughts on how they bring their operations," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers have often in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 with a total of 25 plots.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be roamed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders was funded, a quarter contributed the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac betwiped: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and guins do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White Stand fast: "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-flection line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state funding of Weidevisors.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to disclose the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR signed conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, that may not be an irreversible area not discharge (slopes of 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforatory.</seg>
<seg id="95">Currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build up close 16 kilometres of fence to the fishing project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting surface is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to start if they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate the same as every other - hence the carefully selected fall of Saddam Hussein's downward position in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he had an symbolic Axt in a heated battle with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals for drastic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of booters and Liberty-Imitators would have lynred him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he handle their significance, and especially the importance that it was attributed to her when the famous Poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta wrote: "I don't want to go on a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you can refer to which was later added, not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly properly, but as he formulated it, doesn't really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the abandoned words of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state doesn't only invites any old influence, but the poorest of the poor: "your labor, your poor, and your oppressed mass, that is to breathe freely, / the seashore of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "sling waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who said to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicans, showing the female representation of the female performers of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself is another name: mother of exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the picture with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change the right from right wing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of the Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was objectionate, but rather a early neo-conservative daily, which would bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Fairly uncommon is Limbauma here on anything.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus existed in it to see how they were seen from exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's in truest sense therefore to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome you have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not what you want to know the Perspective, Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine forth the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black commends Scottish members of the United Kingdom team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two shots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship header has a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we are trying to understand, and we will continue until we find out," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen from the team to team-military.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is fairly modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her capitals talk was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or, wherever they live or practice, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling I did, the Eilidh, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal, who will compete with its fifth world championships in the 400-m-hurdles, says that it is "unbelievably" that 16 shotters in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-haul Muir runs on this path in five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It is going to take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to see the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The elite chapters says that they are "enormously proud" on the fact that many of their atriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also may be mixed with the medals and among the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"so special about team capitals, it lies in the fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was enough for me to vote for me that my team mates voted for me and chose me to something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the villi, which belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes wishing to rise to Podien.</seg>
<seg id="155">What do my speech contemplated as chapter?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just noted that we are very happy in that situation, since we have a home World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to use this home support and benefit from it that we are back on the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it's just like a great atmosphere since there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block ewers via Facebook: don't work for a public office if you don't want to reduce the electorate of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers slash him because of all, from the inner policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He marched in the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not bring his critic to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">Because in 1783, Washington said, "Free Speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led as sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on it more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 persons and have been deleted that they have sold their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendants it this week from the beginning of that week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the Governors dismissed the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor with an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary pinion.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand during the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary funding to connect to his voters and deputies his haunloose head according to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thus, the blocking of persons coming on the side of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse rescued the actions of the governors and argued that the comments of comments made nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of rolls or legs or hassert people that swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post Office spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no roller.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thinkable and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked after Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on the polite that I disappointed it was no reaction to hate Hasselt and other current news," wrote them in the commentary area of the news postage "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't realize this idea if a number of people on the same topic takes place, then they are misused by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff of the governors "reported as" focused spam attack "would be able to call" Intercession. "</seg>
<seg id="189">The facebook story makes it easy to use a message by simply blocking a critics or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical leadership and burn, or demonstrators, or demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials responsible for this, that he has implicitly defines Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter Feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County seeded the First Aciment, according to the US District Judge James C. Cacheris at Alexandria when she appointed a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU to its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be as hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable ptos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers spread between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous letter collected upon his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And then Washington had anonymous 15th roll.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" wrote all the letters of papers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticised its position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and navigation of the United Kingdom, have been overwhelmed by the United Kingdom, according to historical documents, which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought her to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Redeem, Free Speech and Discourses are on the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means that to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="431">Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles last year.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models can be collected - 500.000 each, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 requests are currently expected.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those who wish to order today is a "Model 3" for the second half of 2018 at the earliest. if Tesla creates it, his brand new, never ever tested yet in practice with maximum utilization of utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts do that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, however, comes to greater delays, then the imitability of the reservations may be a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="450">"the EPA also often observed its deadlines for the implementation and then maintained in order to be accused of activists, and in an agreement stipulated an appointment for the implementation," said Pruitt, who defendants the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"we do not believe in a regulation by proceeding, and we accept deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="452">We will also take the law and authority who gives us seriously. "</seg>

<seg id="458">"the return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million Americans that are affected by the Smog, who flowed directly from the Smog," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="572">A 1948-year Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and moved to the Ford bridge of Moore.</seg>
<seg id="573">Before the car, the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge, a group of white men came up with rifles to block his way.</seg>
<seg id="574">The leader of the mobs - a man mid-age in a needle strike - took a long train at its cigar, looking at the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="575">Inside, the occupants are in fear.</seg>
<seg id="576">"we want to cut this n ---- r Roger!" brushed the man.</seg>
<seg id="577">"get it off the car!"</seg>
<seg id="578">Cries out of silence when a young black man was distorted by the passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="579">Fortunately, this awful scene, which was played on July 22, was only one relocation.</seg>
<seg id="580">But when a snares are thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all of them in the audience will shoot very real epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="581">Since 2005, civil rights advocates to the Moore's Ford Bridge, in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malsey as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - born from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="582">No one has been indicted for murder.</seg>
<seg id="583">"it's really irreversible, that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we know them in our municipalities even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks that assists in the organisation of relocation.</seg>
<seg id="584">"it's a dirt spot on a history, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year old former Congress of State of Georgia and a life of civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="586">For him it serves as a dramatic call for action and provides an annual reminder of the Monroe community, that there was never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="587">"we want to be prosecuted, we want the termination, we want to reconciliation, we want reconciliation, but first we must receive justice." he said.</seg>
<seg id="588">"we cannot come to healing and reconciliation, until we receive justice."</seg>
<seg id="589">A place of hearing provides a towel on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore-Ford-Lynn on 27 July 1946.</seg>
<seg id="590">According to the FBI files that were received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of the Lynchprocess.</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one was accused ever.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspects stay free for decades on free walking, citizen justify that the double motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole city was always known: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="593">In April 1946, the decision of the Supreme Court admitted the black citizens in Georgia to take their voice to the first time in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="594">About the same time as the election stains according to the FBI of the black Farmpter Roger Malcom, a white land owner, Barker Hester, during a struggle - supposedly due to a woman.</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said that rumour was in the city that Hester slept with Malcoms wife Dorothy sleep and that the baby was born not of her husband.</seg>

<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey in prison.</seg>
<seg id="598">But when she went away from prison, the Moore's Ford Bridge, Lynchmob, moved away by car.</seg>
<seg id="599">"as it emerged, it was Harrison who prepared the murders and arranged it," includes a FBI report.</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a plot between government and local criminal prosecution, which was not only involved in the murder, evidenced evidence and the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks appticulates it yet.</seg>
<seg id="602">"it was a voting right massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="603">"they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community:" when you register, and if you agree, then you will happen to you. "</seg>
<seg id="604">Almost a decade of Lang, Cassandra Greene led the yearly reference to the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Her representation is vivid, hitting and is justified in a kind of deep racism, of which many believe he would not exist in America.</seg>
<seg id="606">It is difficult to see, and even more difficult, but Greene said that this is the point.</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynx because we will be confronted with Him in all confronts," said it.</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I can not build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I did through."</seg>
<seg id="609">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day approached nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and watched as Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is here Greene co-Director.</seg>
<seg id="611">He played the role of chief's role played for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty, because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="613">"but I think it's very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to these times."</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other side of the room the actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barker Hester to play their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece begins with Malcolm, the Hester-cries and urgently pressed him to hatred with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said, n --- he disappeared from my property!"</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona leads the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone (at least all the black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the hottest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," said Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," said Greene, still kichever.</seg>
<seg id="625">"I don't think that the white people at that time 'n --- he said."</seg>
<seg id="626">"yet," witted one of the other black performers.</seg>
<seg id="627">"you only have to hit the hard 'R.'."</seg>
<seg id="628">And in fact, the energy has shifts in the room, a sense of camera leadership replaced the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is busy making this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, if Rascona the N word says he says it sharp and with reprint.</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">The repetition ends and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="634">There are cries, shots, and then silence.</seg>
<seg id="635">A woman, clothed with a dress-dress, stands on the bodies of the actors and leads the "Strange Fruit" starring.</seg>
<seg id="636">Your voice breaks out on each second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred meters behind him a group of about four dozens of people caught sweat and tears from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost uniformly divided between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">A couple left from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down just the street.</seg>
<seg id="640">They all experienced Georgia almost eight hours of Georgios pressed moisture when Brooks they lead them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Until this point, the Morde stayed a necdote, but now, when you took up on the same country where the Lynch-murders took place, the air-dispenser feels.</seg>
<seg id="642">If the last notes of the songs sounds, Greene invites the amount to come closer and to inspecting the body.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children up to their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whispers each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," starred a little boy, as if he had to remember it.</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes, Greene the quantity - and suddenly it is over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the Lynx road and their tears.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bradshaw surrounded by Bradshaw, the man in suit which has played the Clander.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona umarms two of his co-gamers, and then broke out in their poor weeping, and the emotional load of performance breaks out with him.</seg>
<seg id="649">"it is okay," whisperate one of the women.</seg>
<seg id="650">"we know that this is not in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="651">You have done this from a reason. "</seg>
<seg id="652">Later the audience deals with the actors to the dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="653">A white pair of Atlanta troubled at a table with a black pair that they got to know.</seg>
<seg id="654">Denise Duplinski struggled to find words, which has left the performance.</seg>
<seg id="655">"it's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... of the people who look like yourself and those things, because they look like," said it.</seg>
<seg id="656">"what really do I do with me, believe me that Lynne is still going on," she said, "Today, it is called only police shooting."</seg>
<seg id="657">In the same room, Tyrone Brooks's farm holds on its table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he started to plan the performance in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the conclusion is inspiring in a certain way, because she describes the horror of what we have experienced, but it is also a moment of learning." he said.</seg>
<seg id="660">"it's like that if we learn nothing of it, then it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="661">He who doesn't study their own story, who doesn't know his own story, is condemned to repeat them. "</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432 patients the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="1141">While a disaster of the PSG could be spontaneous when the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA didn't apply as a legitimate income.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-year-years Grunge-comedy "The State" for MTV (for himself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As cultural artefacts it is alike a parody and a shortage of our Facebook capable era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But when Franchise feels it, the time would be short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humour (it contained a original history for a speakable box vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By playing on the core of the today- actor since middle ages, intermediate ages are playing for children who are grown - but they made the impossibility to win the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with its adults who are now adults, is less emotional confusion and his parody goes more according to the watering principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90-s "(" The hand That Cradle ").</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost its virgins.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is still another crazy marmalicious plot that has been involved in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showold) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well maintained impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always the extravellers are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, whose former big Man-Man-on Camp Andy feels like an old backer.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments of random whales that could heat this franchise as a sort of repetition "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I will show as its logical conclusion: "WET Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band as they attend the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon has now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: on the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "Glow" with its East-West ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka were created as a director with Rhys Thomas as a director: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, which fight for truth, Atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda-drama - a murderer that bears a Reagan-mask - is that it often plays a single story.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it moves around, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who has been digitized to a lower length, since Gregor and Iosef are always able to visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always busy from two thick men that swallow up a bunch in Hamburg.</seg>

<seg id="1232">The data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "by people who have long been no longer a life, or of citizens who have become a German citizen and no longer should dive in the register."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England is holding interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged, since the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation rejects the speculation about a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain, "when she kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Bank's policy decision makers (MPC) voted in the Bank with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with this month fewer members could rise to rise, as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly annual inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6%, and it would continue to continue the pressure on the household income, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signposted that in the coming years of interest rate it would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Brexit, and it said that the bank costs may possibly increase by more than expected to the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members voted to withdraw a part of the mammoth economic package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will require a time for financial plan to prepare for banks, although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds Sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Minutes after the decision about the interest rate said the Bank said: "in the central prediction of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains short, as the pressure on the real population of households continued to imply the consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">To interest rates, it repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" for cooling of inflation and a "slightly larger" extent would be required when the markets are expected.</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets currently forecast the first growth in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">However, the Bank stressed that enhancements "will be gradually called" and "limited."</seg>

<seg id="1275">It retained its growth forecast for 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1,31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1,11 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures increasing increasing expectations to a rate hike and the GDP has risen to 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter although it is slightly recover from the Bank at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1280">The most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by a rising inflation and minor wages since the vanishing first becomes worse before they get better.</seg>
<seg id="1281">She added that monetary policy in the next few years can't stop "but" but she added that wages "wages" will recover significantly in the end of their three-year forecast. "</seg>
<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak Pounds, resulting in a portion of lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes to a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sine wave.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the last judgment of the Bank, the call has risen to interest rates, when inflation increased its pressure on hard-swapped households, with three political decision makers required a rise to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="1286">The inflation decreased in the last month of 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Andrew Montbris, Director at Coreco Mortgage Broker, said: "in view of the short return of the swap-rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive, because lending business was strongly looking for shops and to finish the year in a positive way.</seg>

<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that a pre-recorded impositional hylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied to a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>

<seg id="1296">Preclusion hylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that PrEP was significantly reduced in the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">PrEP in front of sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to avoid HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such prescription drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">For those who are involved in question, are pregnant or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners that have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In the clinics, participants are identified that agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a registered physician are also able to register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs in this week according to an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study is said to evaluate the full potential of PrEP by clinical data collected as it was used in large scale specifically and implemented.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "these great new intervention should be far more extensive and more successful efforts to insulating HIV and get over.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in developing one of the greatest health challenges of mankind. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">PrEP when it is targeted for needy and endangered people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV-epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September to people will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really checked, and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to improve many of many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "the priority is now on-hand that the study will soon be carried out throughout the country and that no one that has a risk for HIV is left.</seg>
<seg id="1312">Now, since the PrEP test medicine was completed, we are on the best way to protect more than 10.000 HIV-infected people. "</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, Shadows-Haran, said: "the start of the PrEP process is welcome to monthly late delays and obsolete implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how to be transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and terminate the transfer of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of PrEP.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the large life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banana with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 by a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne was not packed and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex-bridge in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have made me in love with them and made a quote on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first tour the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a single room property with a spared layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into bedroom - wanted to add Joanne box room and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "says she.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that had 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home, not just a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to solve the suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were overthrown by each other, without that we had to bail.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just therefore to build a simple platform, but set the steel so that it had the right height at the top or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper lights of Retrouvius will look down on the glamous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Fashioned gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illuminate the style of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in removing theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance one pired units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of the Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamoural space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if they are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art came in," Erfan was proclaimed by the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important so that it is when you push the door, very light."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage room, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is estimated," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agents will occur and a calculation based on the bottom size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and the help to create an emotional binding in a home" says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment is characterized by good design and increased square meter of slightly more standardly in something completely.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, how Joanne, could you decide to leave this.</seg>

<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have collected 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">The Westco Jeans family established and grew up in a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city's rum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with their deceased father Colin made "main operator and the dominating personality" in the family De Lutis - about two-thirds of the company's wealth and Paul is about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial system said that Colin is property of $316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The splitting of real estate and cash has proved himself for Paul as a problame.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the proposed by Colin proposed numbers have left him with the left, which I kept for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in an initial affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="1367">On Friday, after several failed years, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers will now fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims to have him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued that it is not true, but throws Paul to manage some owners.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit which was filed by Colin, he says he will trust the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held at the law office.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, the dairy bars and delikatessary shops in the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">You used the security to buy the Collingwood lifeat that Colin made the first jeans of the family in Colin.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started West at Westco as he was in the last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old). "</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass her property for her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before Court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis-Group, with Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company's US $10 million and Luke 26 million were paid.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says "on the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has held very well, though he was a former AFL Board member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire of the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Luton with Colin and Paul De Lutis.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can really say much," because the case is before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very very sad, that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our family name by the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have known that Paul and I would like to vote in our current dispute," said he and added that he still hope to have a solution. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">Friday seemed all hope to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our issue will be solved in the near future of the courts," wrote Colin.</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the media abinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried it and are failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict information flow on president Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the chief of a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, opened his first working day with senior employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he replicated: bad news that guessed into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees to flow information about him - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump, closely monitoring its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television goes back for decades - and now, where he's in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when the candidate was delayed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs, said the former election agent Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep trumps Twitter custom at control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign agents perhaps know what we do not know - that drumps Tweets without their interventions would have been included more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We probably never read something about the Tweets which has not sent dropping.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators have made it some time, trouble-care of him, their efforts have been worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody knows it to prevent trump conservatory.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in one of the White House, which consists of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by submitting trump material presenting its views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - reported on this story - reported on the preferences of an advisor to the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump civil servants say that Trump can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he will find out to figure out where these are.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone contrasted a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the representative of his wound in Katie Walsh, "the source behind an heaps to be at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson was exbanished from Twitter, or that he has sold no more concrete evidence, or that he had expressed false allegations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to inquire about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove itself as an effective manager in Priebus, but trump is still its impulsive self, and its advisors still remains to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make itress mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the city of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">That is good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the hotels Birkenhof through the then ambience of operating company mbH about 13 April 2014, some 30 000 nights per year were lost and revenues also went through the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic numbers of refugees, which came to the County, the hotel building served as a collective accommodation that looked out for controversial discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers through the preparation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>

<seg id="1453">He was right to keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with registered office in Bad Bergzabt has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it up to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabians and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>

<seg id="1459">The floors were taken out, ceilings to the part reduced, old tubs from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>

<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large-walk showers, the input range will be redesigned, new window will be built.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Poliler sets a Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia Affair around US President Donald Trump, he is intended to announce a special Grand Jury in a report by Robert Mueller according to a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The board included the work for the last weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote on appeal to the people confidential.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN transmitter reported that it is already the first pre-charge of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">US secret services accuse the Kremlin for longer than expected in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether they talked between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are expected to participate in the campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">He reportedly took Mueller even more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the Washington Post published a few weeks ago that the special issue Trump personally has moved into the centre and seek to serve the forcing, whether he may disabled the judiciary in the wake of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to check the evidence in possible preventing cases and to decide whether the accusation should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore called one of the count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly, they are turned on when larger and controversial cases are turned on.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure takes place always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to recharge persons under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-loaded charges were issued to turn the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting are called upon a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps also consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushers as well as his damal election manager Paul Manafort he in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television, that the fact show that Mueller failed in his work failed, and that he should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not be broken that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nonetheless the reduction of the committee on the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelation the President on Thursday evening an address given in West Virginia to depict the Russia affair as campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a complete invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme give the Democrats a way to feel good, because they don't have anything else that they can talk. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he wiped nothing from the suspension of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work in the salms, stressed it.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special order to "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey had three times that it was not determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One reason I have no reason to accept that something was changed in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of these instatwurfs, allegations were made against Trump, he wants to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to post an investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to portrayal of US media, the White House was collected against the Special Policies and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The disbanded speculated about it, if Trump Mueller is dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Otherwise, as an independent special mediator of the congress like in the Watergate affair to the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller found a position in which he could be fired at theoretical time by the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several transmitters of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators exhibited on Thursday bills before, after which the special invaders could no longer be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic a gigantic iceberg has solved from the barely seven times of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">The scientist Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Seasealogy were shared on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The over one trillion tonnes heavy and 5800 square kilometers large Coloss plagued to the north and probably will need two to three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest rutmost iron, who have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people does not go from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the Eisberges, is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, a total of approximately 30 years, there have been an unusual interroment of iron particles in the region, writing the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact basis.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many scientists, it is possible to hang together with the heating.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Now the broken colossment was so far from Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swimmers on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow steadily into the sea and regularly crashes regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Scheldois located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelice was the equilibrium of waxes and stopped for some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shot is to fall there, writes the AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There's some that the Larsen-C-Schelskiris, at risk, since the front edge is never seen as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice top will be under voltage and can be crushed in case of a piece of keys.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt from Schelfeis and iceberg is not raising the sea level because they slows on the water, and ice cream so much water as it yields after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the chancer led to that the glacier appears directly into the sea and much quicker can be overflowing as before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level above sea level, however, only in a low degree, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest Schelfeis of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metre thick, on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural phenomenon, and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most comprehensive withdrawal since the start of records," he confirmed it.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists were disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelskiris will return or in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman and said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But that development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not lead the demolition of this gigantic skate iron on climate change, so in recent decades, however, a lot of polar bears on the Antarctic Peninsula are crumbled.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long stretch of Antarctica is in the South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have been heated by about three degrees in the past 50 years and thus forced to the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break the Kreistag has set 41 new positions in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now there are 17 trainees their first working day behind him.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very desirable.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 people were randomly posted to places for this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, it is still missing the circle further to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At the moment, there are still 50 positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">We are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative in the Kreistag together with the FDP and the UWG to oppose the initiative and to oppose the professionals in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the parties "party, the administration will work for personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet, not just short-term conversions of skilled workers, but trendangered the candidate of the candidates, means it means.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be based on interior and externally, concrete measures for transmissions and an apprenticeship offensive do not require CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That listens to a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems, which one knew not so far.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns werlow good officials and employees, offering more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The talk is from a real "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">This includes a high number of employees, the disease or age due dates from the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Highest time for action, so that no more digits remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter races, leader of the CDU, will continue with his party on the request of his request.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long gone from the Kreistag for a fausto thick surprise when he publicly placed the personnel costs openly in question and that of the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Nations wants to check all the opportunities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"in case of a satisfactory solution, the circle administration with the trade unions should also be able to rise to a home country, perhaps even in cooperation with the cities of the country - as well as nations.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In order to pay the CDU, the employees and civil servants are trying to pay better than the public service for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently obligatory, enhancements or more money there is only if you changes into a higher level which is oriented to professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established, where employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitching protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning was a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team worked effectively with human traders in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20 months of her conviction will be in jail for 15 months and five years were exposed to probation.</seg>
<seg id="1664">He was sentenced to life in June due to negligent killing of Conrad Roy, which took to life on July 13, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing of his hearing, "My family is uncomforting."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but their legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy came to a psychic illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured gluse, Carter frequently faced with tears in the eyes with folded hands and in the left eye, when she was condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have been killed by Conrad Roy," said the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to make their own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has no responsibility, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has no Reue". "</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters Attorney said it was a "awesome surrounding, whom she was completely sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, did not find out that her "age or ripeness or even their mind-disease have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">An Attorney read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, claiming that there is no day when I didn't feel the loss of my beloved Son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">I would like to know that he is proud of me and as I go with everything. I try to bear in spite of all my sorrows that we are going for eternity with us, for his sisters, "is it in it.</seg>

<seg id="1679">"not to have any more this single person, with whom I have been together for my birth every day, is a pain I kept for the rest of my life always with me," said it.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The case seems to place a justifying precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to claim his suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case referred to national attention when Carters text message revealed that she encourages him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hanged on, spring from a building, don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that had sent them in the two weeks before his death, while he was with his family on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the sight of his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad's and" Everything you have to do is to switch to the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told that Carter sought the attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should take advantage of some of your press from the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case is divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Among the few that Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder of her British co-inhabitants in Italy, was acquitted before two years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The well-occupied Napoli storm was frequent, moreover, Süver tried to play a couple of times successful in the game construction.</seg>

<seg id="1752">The BMW chairman said that "it is the opinion that" it is smart options as driving restrictions, "and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to provide or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler was announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described companies as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automobile manufacturers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides to emit the diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays, to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and undisturbances drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what you feel safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office which were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009 or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words at a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter to propose name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and panic feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug aduggling, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no quiet period of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are frequent, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has stepped down in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, you are publishers and their inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deeply stirred, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle-finger with the word "Justice" on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though in 2010, a special coup was established in order to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, who are connected to drugs each year, the murderers of journalists is only rarely found in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodoce they still exist on to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untramous, although the terrain is still trailaternal.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without informing about the murderers, without justice, the meeting regarding the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to turn my time into this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why, we know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated into "12th River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius was gone away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing about Valdez for silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans has been arrested in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Zinaloa became one of the most bloodiest battlefields in the country, as the rival factions are fighting here to fill in vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the streets, or that the cemetery is full of hasted, two-story mausoleum for drug canals, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only one Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs cases in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the release of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rival of a rival cardboard fractions held in the war with Guzmans.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may be offended, suspected of the crew purchased each copy of the output as soon as they delivered to newspaper kiosk.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistakes was to force Valdez not to force, after the capture of a different newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country at its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could not be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he sold together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 U.S. dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without stumbling to the Rauschom issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time it served as a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the revenue and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved to publish hard and hard investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories, nobody else dare to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Mary-Moors Cabot Award" for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage, in pursuing the Mexican drug history, where they always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave willingly offered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to keep going on, he said at the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drugs in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the job as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you say about so many murders? why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who managed as a port worker, the friend who was generously with hugs and suggestions, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, going on the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well, they ask: was his love for a routine to be?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced them to ask their own measures in question how they can do their work on the best way and staying alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their pure shops, their native start and runways, to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-scenic and self-accounting.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it is wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal, that "odour has a sense to be deceived... and then the thing with Javier runs."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others, do not apply in Sinaloa, as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuges, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce to security training, there were suddenly no mobiles. days before, Spyware, who is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">There were two policemen to protect the heat from 104 degrees Celsius (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building from Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporter, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who are governor himself as non-trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter had gone into the mountain landscape, where the Drug Administration facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a exposé to state spending, concentrated on the hometown of the governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that was found in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official saying about it, who was abducted or how it happened, so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally locally known by drug traders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter took out public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), who ruled nearly all the political levels almost all.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri governors were charged due to high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In Villarrestrained the reporter had to write on previous incidents in this local time, among them one, in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers had previously tested the column by Valdez as the best informed by the kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something, what they had never expected: activist in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporator Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration to an attorney at the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the Western State of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and civil servants, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists had become more powerful, proscribed in organized protests, "SOS Press" on obedience and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, Director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international assistance for the judiciary in the fall of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send journalists and to destroy them, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has therefore sought therefore that she is divided into the government again, because she's worried that her groove has violates her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez was said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico of organized crime that involved government officials and a uniform society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that Reporter should not only be killed by drugs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were killed in organized crimes under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the "Articulo 19" media group received more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>

<seg id="1898">Obviously the Morde obviously have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgot the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas card: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones besides her separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in northern state-state Chihuahua, after the assassination of Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others are going on, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drug cartels with a map on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is difficult to find work in exile, and still watch the streets and seek to dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chunted, as evidenced by the photographer of Reuben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz in three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra who once wanted to be poet, indicates that the drug traffed him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and therefore I was reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already completed, the editors of Riodoce at the office were sitting in front of the office and drank beer, as all their telephones at summers started.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting with bandages and security forces near the Mazatlan's bathing area had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the boarding ground you have published the news on the site of Riodoce about mobile.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who held the guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">When it was afraid at all, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the tremendous portrait of the unusual founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"as you can also remember," said Bojorquez, "when Javier was assassinated on the same day that Javier was assassinated, the practitioners was asking myself to send them to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Tried Dinosaurs using camouflage to soften his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">The first glance looks like a statue, although a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhinocorns of a Canadian miners have been so well preserved that experts were described as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even determine that his flaky skin was from reddish Braun - and they said they would have had anything from a 'troubled past. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology," awarded him as "the holding company Dinosaurs, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil remains a newly discovered kind of Nodosaura which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-held condition has researchers that describe it as "really remarkable"</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the panniated plant nivores will be the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio while on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, pit.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something, what appeared from the surrounding rocks at the place, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of severe pearches.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all these hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blinking only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it hatched," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosaurs specimens - the mona Lisa of the Dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant carnivores, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a wall-flowing shell, probably threatened by mealnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The highly treated Dinosaurs is a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from prey, and used a shielding technology that is used as counteract, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been permitted to mix well in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts predict that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature of the Nodosaurier family has been made for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours in order to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of sheds and armory of his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">It discovered the shady shady, an widespread defence method in the animal, meaning that the tip of the creature was dark as its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the remaining shady is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of the site of Borealopelta increased by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted enough pressure through the nivorous Dinosaurs, the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the confusion - think of toe, zebra or belt animals - are much smaller and inviolently as a prey that was signalized that this nodosaurier was exposed to a genuine fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong robbertier behaviors on a massive, strongly aded dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs robatic animals of the Cretaceous must have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the dinosauriers is red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists investigate further information on his life, including his preserved Darminate, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, came into a river and cast into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta were so warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more landward than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also remains in three dimensions, and the original form of the beast keeps," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">They don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time, when huge thermal-emitting, carnivorous Dinosaur, which stood on two legs, went through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the pannied dinosaurs was hunted from some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists believe the latest insights in the specialist magazine Biology, believe that Borealopelta was stripped after the death in the ocean and were mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Radio while on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, pit.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the most surviving dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures had approx. 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg) weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips which raced from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the coarsely shredded plants was established through the western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded in the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosauriers kept his armor in exquisitely item detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The mainstated remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin treats still cover holprige shells along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, such a level as the conservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see, the more I get there.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The remains of the skin still cover the holprimal tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole 'sole'.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: Massenkaredolage A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Strong accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 cars were involved in a massage-ambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, climbs long stables, and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), some 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass aredaredolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data on the police, 15h00 between the connection stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, interconnected.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Over the exact number of injured individuals there were no information about this.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was just about light to moderate injuries, one of the police prefers.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A big granting on rescue vehicles was on the accident point.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">A ten-kilometre return journey was formed in Munich direction Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ-reporter, it also occurred on the counter-way to massive disabilities - by many gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade notted the characteristics of the vehicle tanker, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45, a second accident happened on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dleasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A Rescue driver was on the way to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: Group tested "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced at once: nothing sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a great idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: tarted.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Does the Schaffner come and wake an unsure or crackout the ride in the midst of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn tests are currently the potential travel ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">Simply confirmation by mobile phone that one can be taken place and evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">At present, a trial operation runs on two routes.</seg>

<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available on many other correspondence routes in Germany in the beginning of the year. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is the road calls for the ticket sellers without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to utilize the use, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to booked an online ticket - what has already done most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You must also be purchased via the app, the DB Navigator, which is why the most comfortable type of ticket booking is.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">For the "Comfort Check-in" works: it grows in the train, calling his ticket by "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers the button appears to be an electronic discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendant to their mobile devices will receive a message that Hgast X is located in the train and has taken the booked seating area Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train attendant to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already available online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to keep on, continue to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the course - what to use for the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you wish to travel without ticket control by our train attens, check-in at the DB's Navigator simply itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to make their travel time in the train line, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Manager of DB district traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those often goes, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains, the ticket inspection are among the biggest doctors.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case, one of all documents do not need any documentation, which is needed for the validation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the card or identity card or the identity document or otherwise a document must be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The consequence are endless discussions between train attendant and ride, which leads to bad mood in the part or greater area and delays in control of your own tickets and Schaffner takes up the time to take care of others.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is also available on the ICE Station 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further access numbers on the same circuit are not unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">What an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken by its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis's building on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She dreamed over a mail from someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confusing, as nobody had posted the information on their feedback, she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retched on its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper, from the area of St. Louis, was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen, Ferguson, Mo., was killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lefosem body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," he thought about himself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and their fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="2030">You put your mobile phone off to be back to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be their brows father, who brought a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed an Live-Feed that a policeman standing in front of a group demonstrators with a belline dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, assured another police officers and cried, saying, "I will kill you all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," he reminiscent of their testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder that we have used to us and we can call."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt plating frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she repeated her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of human beings living in the community and have filled the streets to request answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell possessed with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past."</seg>
<seg id="2047">They must know and see it and be drawn in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">You have to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give you a experience in which they do not have experienced clatous racism, it is no other than the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them far off. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a location across the police station, which was attended by a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Chief Financial Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly I began to assume a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after August 9 totally changed" and she noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Master Student Nose Association and focused on Essens Justice and health inequalities in black municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell in the meaning: "would you document or tries to find a story that you can use it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was feeditary due to countless cases of people often, often by white - in a community who benefited from their grief and her resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">How did Folayan declared in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centred, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism rum around Todestiny.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment, Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting it was shot.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary isn't anyone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as those people will be presented, because I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The aim was to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that the movement is "not around a Messiah leaders, but for a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents reveal "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferut life, as she loves to be married and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that this work and in the manifestation of black men have to give a certain danger."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of the black swelling women in the wider black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012 to identify the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women must carry the main burden of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to notice that "the movement really kept from black women and a lot of black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insisted that "this is not a potential type of action," when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film by Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raged this power," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence that she was in front of the front, because with a life of these clocks than a black, pregnant woman is so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras have gone away into Ferguson, but the rassischen connections have disappeared between the community and the police.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on request for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the neighborhood that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nonetheless it clammates to a singing and she feels himself to this memory, since it went into Ferguson on the road three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "size wahn": TV readers discuss a bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although they are not yet built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern zone of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 the population in reference and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves almost one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" is discussed the topic.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While they say a bit Gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "that would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man will need" (Siggi Bags) or quite simply: "the size of Lars!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents make sure a gallery of more customers in the city, of which the other stores also benefit, fears that the pedestrian precinct the pedestrian precinct.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned on the premises on which the farmers market stands, in which 13 directors are marketed its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will end with the start of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - in fact, with the possibility of seating for a seated position.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been selling nearly weekly in the peasantry market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the country are very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">The butchers have also been discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that, during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities it is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marker in a market hall in the gallery, arrives at the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This is likely to be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping mall in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drsery or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops available here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since it is not even a regular weekly market, it is so important that at least us will maintain at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the merchandise is freshly offered here, is mainly offered directly from the producers and is obsollow priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms, because the local rets are often not portable for an retailers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special business is almost no longer and that of it is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a Markthalle does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the peasant market during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration, if the bit gallery ever comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it manage to drive from Bitburg to drive all the shops in Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">My view would have been better to carry out a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant marker, give it a lot more - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg does not place any place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant markthalle is made, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown which are almost insignificant - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of Wangen-tupiers and hairpin, which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the cutouts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyser had an 35-year sentence, after she publicly graduated in a secret report about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline was internatant in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and groundbreaking dissidy, whose sentence was converted to Barack Obama at only three days.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of the DNA that could be extracted from the 30 portraits, such as any intellectual comment not only to the shape of DNA data - which can be interpreted and the inherent determinants of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born by Bradley Edward, but already existed since her puberty over the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 by 20 accusations, among them six violation of the spy law, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison its picture was suppressed, so very that there was only a single photo - a grained, black-white selfie, stuck in the Manning very well on a passenger seat and is wearing a platinblonde perer - which it was associated with them.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced portrait portraits of strangers of forensic species such as cigarette lighters and chewing gum by using the DNA from waste to produce a picture of it like these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when it received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they brought an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany the portrait of this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and could not be photographed at that time, therefore they took action in Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to do a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarat Muse were sold to unbalance and nephew, who ruled several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Supports images," which was a future foreseen in which the president will see the presiding judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, they would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of fortunate agreements.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition some depth and Starkes, since Donald Trump causes a war against informant from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to solve the rigid spans, which he actually should remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey-Hagborg, a strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery the artistic statement called the Manning with their oversized signature (the "i" in their family name) an end of the "automatic disintegration, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg trusted since the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific cyclopeon of the artist) how amazing similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people are hopefully, our genome does not take care of, who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video artwork of 2007, Tracker Memories is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories so that the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it dives with a free-release pen in the hand of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if you chill your speech, then they won," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"never content your mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I'll always look forward when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predicted in the Comic book - but if they should do it, then she will be welcomed into the middle of the room of masks, from their own genomic Simulakren, which summarized as hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">That was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, until the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic haploggroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a human amount," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement, like the movement that were also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA footballers in one side of the new practice fields of the teams are talking on the campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have gone out their tricott parts and show the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these untary minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminated two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it has lengthens its days - at least until the finale at Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA should start at 19: 15, in order to be able to meet the players already packed in.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than one day, where the Bruins moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school, during Moras during the first time, during Moras, during Moras during the summer school, during Moras during Moras during the summer school.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the course of the formal game preparations for their prelude against Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Create a Comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s a hole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its comfortable seat in the refuge River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful, on the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England's spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: it wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was unexpectedly launched.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a writing, which was written by a double agents in the 1700's, which he worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his Daumenabdruck!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters only smell as smoke, because it was lit for a fire because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For anyone who lives more than 300 years later, the odour has a effect as he himself would be.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For anyone who is defeated so with old papering that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a chateau ("To be honest: I have a little over") seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, as about the mounted Hybs on walls and the bottles, the centuries had spent in the moat.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the land and the ruins of the ancient castle, and spoke with rural conservation, gardener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received its full access in 2006 when the last Eram, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived one decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive which he said as "hundreds of years, in which Aristocrats said" Oh, confusing it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps, those who had said: "it could mean that land flippers might be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all its gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore a wider basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer' that follows a man that relocated the newly built Castle to join the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a tumult which occurred 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a insurrection was a good beginning.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are joined together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit family, which gave the family Darrell hidden for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smugglers', which is depicted in the smugglers Arthur Darrell of the 18th century, emphasized his own funeral that he filled a sarg with stones (a discovery that was dug only after years later).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the men bees to be fitting the fence and spending money for things which they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men soldered their debt crises by giving full old women in marriage - I present them as a heap good looking lads, with a talent in order to make a landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">- After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes in search of other unique write experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elseänmäki, the site of a Sanitary from the early 20th century, which has been rescued from nature since then.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back again," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Ah, now I have to get ready with the damn life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign started: over 300 years old Marienkapelle went to Rhöndorf</seg>
<seg id="2324">With the relief of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef last Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (Rundschau of Thursday).</seg>
<seg id="2325">Until Thursday, Mayor Otto NEUHOFF and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan.</seg>
<seg id="2326">At the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign to give a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.</seg>
<seg id="2327">"to be nice for us.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Or?, "asking the makers for the promotion since yesterday at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"we do not think (of course!) really, write them on their yesterday's website.</seg>
<seg id="2330">"but we use this measure to win your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And to make clear that it seems better than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Basically, we are the permanent generation that we considered a bath of sobeeing citizens to know the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "</seg>
<seg id="2333">At the action there is more than "just" a logo and a slogan, meaning it continues.</seg>
<seg id="2334">"there is a unique promise to formulate, one that gives the city an unmistakable objector feature."</seg>

<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (Yas) advises about retirement and promotions in officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week also.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting took place no more in the building of Staff, as previously, but in the office's office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the presidency of the government, the five Deputy Group as well as the ministers for Defence, Inneres, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">That was the number of civilians in the Yas.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government relocates the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office but the manders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were deposed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed Coup State Secretary of Staff 169 of 326 Generals and admirers were fired.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleged connections on the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan as wire drawing of the coup.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Around 486 people who have been involved immediately in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day following the coup, Erdogan was named as "God's gift," because he was giving him the opportunity to cleanse the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the handle in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the "Hürriyet Zeitung" published an article with the heading "Undiscomfort in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the Staff, there is evidence for an increasing "Islamic" Army, which manifested themselves among others in the abolition of the Federal Institute for Soldators, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The most uncleanness in the army and the security forces continues to go on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan deprived another 7395 archers, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In this way it seemed to have been grounded to the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals are earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times she embarked on his role as a guardians of world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After its election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least recently under calling for reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say, Erdogan implied on specifically a Islamism of armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the Vocal Europe magazine "Vocal Europe," a well-called officer, seeking for asylum from persecution abroad, seeking Turkish army within a few years "full of extremists and Salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this NATO would not get cold that NATO could not get cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">There is no doubt in the alliance to the purge of doubt at the work of the Turkish army.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Leaders and operations are "weakened," say NATO diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Washington changes the rules for the Green Card</seg>
<seg id="2366">There will be a new US-migration plan to change the rules of Green Card, president Donald Trump, quoted from the media.</seg>
<seg id="2367">It looks before, to reduce the legal immigrate to 50,000 per year, stricter regulations for travel permit and limitations for families-oriented visa.</seg>
<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"this law will decrease poverty, and increase wages and billion dollars for taxpayers and will do that by the U.S. will change the way, as the citizens from other countries will be given to Green Cards."</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will avoid the chains migration and replace the current system.</seg>
<seg id="2372">This new application procedure will come to the candidates who have English speaking to support the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge to come to our economy, "said Trump, quoted from American media.</seg>
<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to make route for racing shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Back in the past few months, more than the future of the racing car body was fought, and it is expected to go quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year the tour is scheduled to be built on the tourist road.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing department in the long term, according to the traffic of the public Department, construction work is expected to begin on track in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to order and to order the stretch of Ilmenau-racing further, the country knows that the country is especially important for tourism, declared the traffic State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the route has been reduced to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">This sum will take 75 percent of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country, is currently being matched at the moment, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the Southern Office of the operator acts as a operator for technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"thus, the roadmap used in the vehicles and the quality standards are traded," Sühl said.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The race-shuttle service will be ordered regularly on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The race-back-Shuttle is an especially popular train connection between the Ilmenau-and racing railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">In the past months, in the course of a pilot project, the route has been widely used by plenty of people to order in the future again.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The distance is also very dilapidated in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The Ascent of Sex-Robots is real and we should worry about to worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just when you thought there will be not yet crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments within the field of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we have to start to take up their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye Color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernes.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people have fun about it, but the company deliver any amount of it, and we will be able to see them more often more common," said Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sinuators have developed from their inflatable partners with a silicone skin that feels warm, with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robot also according to its beliefs "and thereby select all from the eye color of the robot about the form of breast warts to the type or the color of his fingerngel.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will still be worquieted because many robots acknowledge the "personalities" which would look like a Stepford's wife.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern scooters have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Realbotix robot allows for example to adapt their users to the properties that are engaging to the properties like timid.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relentness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality which makes your personality as good as possible," is warmed to the Website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">You may like what you like, and she don't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She has also kept its mood during the day - as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed on conversation or can be fixed "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the understandable female properties that occurs on rape if one step towards vangid (called here: resisted) Farrah, beckdown one in most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his Website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robot wasn't just a fat or just a different sexist.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence or its increasing refinement refer to a slightly darker and deeper understanding in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal solution of Gender Equality to a wish of sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, have no sex robot, and while the FRR indicated their rising popularity, they still remain provisionally on the fringe of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what caused the marginal zones, in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or revived, until the free market is given for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain persuasibility that these high-developed sex robot in a time immersed in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which it gives an president in the White House, who thus talked to have women attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Cramaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid's') are not the graphic images that appears swallowed up, but as realistic this vision.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it feels like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robot is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Your growers wanting to feel human being, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point if it is about their "personalities," the robots represent no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They are not able to separate or walk away from her companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Otherwise stated: you are falsely slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speeches of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps huge performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the attack of healthy human beings</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is turned into a supporter trial of Trump-era, that the political spans, which have polarized the U.S. electorate, have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankets were in the USA newspapers with suggestions about how to deal with the horror of trump-selected relations.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We strain us all supposedly to allow our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It has been reduced less than the power of Trumps, Families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have chosen this because my cousin, a left-directional slide show in Chicago, has long been working with the Republicans in our family, who has visited me in New York for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They remembered that unity against a common enemy could have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican relationship with which they fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite intrinsically on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to the dining table, there is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this is also substantial risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The line was strengthened by trump, but the issuing effect of its Presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the grillful possibility that our bib will not stumble in a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, there is still lack of long-time scenario in which Trump republicans the right wing of the right wing "normalizes," which appear at once in comparison to his standards suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I found myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney, the dog on the car roof, which looked after 14% income tax (but at least we knew how its tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact, as a very mild offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to Carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York parking department, and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city when there is no caffeine needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs in the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely finster and climate-friendly music conveys this on a notable manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clubs have disappoint a city: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines will be familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not far beyond the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the themes of Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the North of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karussell is still a strange experience, since here two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel vehicles: what do they need to know now</seg>
<seg id="2491">How accurate is the software update?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Must diesel engines be participating in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers to the overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group has offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are supposed to improve the emission behavior of cars of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa are assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the handled software updates are optional.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have Schumann software," Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Federal Office of the Federal Office (KBA) ordered its rearmament.</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and after when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers have announced a fast conversion in the next few months, but still does not have an exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has forwarded to write every person concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If you require an inspection, it will be done in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the conversion arise totally?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The inconsistencies of the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen that the car manufacturers are not so far at the topic of the environment."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long shall the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">In the workshop only three to four hours could last.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time will be able to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What can drivers do, which do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE oblique to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably foreign manufacturers would draw, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is now a massive price fall of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE fears that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But to the regions where the group is threaten.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumaster, continues in the next year in Rente.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The passage is already written - suitable applicants are rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years Wacker is the hacker.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great for him, as he was mediated in the Press Conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports varied, but also challenging tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, we wonder that there is no application to request the desired profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The town is looking for the closest potential of an architect or building engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - under the contempt of regular participation periods - still enough time for training.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach worked for the administrative community as a subcontractor, the candidate must demonstrate respective contracts.</seg>
<seg id="2544">For this function does not want to keep the city any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Wouldn't fill it any more, you would have to leave citizens to open until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the city and itself is important, says Wacker, who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office there have gathered some important projects to look back on Wacker with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, a varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla Areas and the Niederhound parking lot are infected.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinetic-Bridge is renewed between Bollenbach and Steinach, also the stadium is still subject to theme.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will strike with some 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design skills be present for a Stadtbaumaster of large backlash.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With havester's own building yard and gardener can be flexibly acted on a multi-flexible way.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move much," so Wacker, and the creation of green plants will be praised by citizens and visitors often.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town are as ensemble of monument protection, it is important to have "an eye to have prepared," if new buildings are approved, emphasises the leaving Stadtbaumaster.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The Stadtbaumaster carries high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is builder, "at the end, everything goes on my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">For care and coordination he can count on many years of experience: Markus Staier (High construction) has been doing so for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep building) has been around for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Even so that his successor is long wishes: "we're looking for someone who really identified and stay with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the other design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Whoever wants to inherit Roland Wacker is to tell information about the town of Haslach as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with specialised architecture in the fields of building application and planning permission.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Stadtbaud building under construction and civil engineering, planning planning, real estate agencies, administrative building, municipal property with building yard and municipal court as well as under monument protection agency including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike on lines are thrown: southern line blocked</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the previously unknown cyclers had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116).</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so strongly damaged that the prevailing freight lift had to be left.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go from two male perpetrators and are looking for the night seasons after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the Tatars there were witnesses a throttest esseer and a bike driver.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that goes far beyond a Lausbusier," said ÖBB-spokesperson Christoph Posch said to APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The or the perpetrators were brought in danger themselves into large peril and also endangered by train.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage to the Lok and the plant, and the delay's delay and the costs for rail transport, more-ray of railway customers may also come to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">All in all, the subject was told by a "considerable" sum "says the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damages were fixed to Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south line could be guided without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">A friday of ten staff were unusual, two of them concerned the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall, but they had delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to the ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of surface had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to linking IBD (anti-inflammatory bowel)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can capture your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could reduce symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unholy state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, caused magnets and blisters, recurring or bloody injuries, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">As those affected normally, meat and dairy products have come to avoid their symptoms, researchers found in the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins were to develop, that promote tolerant immunity, that promote tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immunity cells in the intestines were patrol in order to make sure the harmful microbes that enter into the body do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are imable to trigger inflammation, protect cells and protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too much inflammation in the direction of inflammation, it can cause inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments I found that a type of tolerance-carrying immune cell in mice, which bear a particular bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterias art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan who had mice in their food, the more they had them from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L'reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diet tolerated, less inflammatory intestinal worsenus, if the same system will work with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan sought a kind of immunity, which was found out that a group of study group had such cells, but one other group of the same tribe that was not accommodated, but had not had to be accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were DNA sequenced and were found in six bacterias which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were removed in a sterilized environment, so that they were not developed a intestinal microbial and they were not developed these kind of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and immunity cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacterifies to the immune system, the researchers left the reuteri in a liquid and then brought small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid has been cleaned, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan Metabolism which is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophenings were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us would protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan add-by products from L. reuteri to develop cells in people such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote because these cells control inflammations at the inner surface of the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to a broadening of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2622">New tide for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">Like the wind twists: when Sigmar Gabriel was still pointed out by the SPD, S & D ministered to a certain concern in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Naked no disruptions from Party central, merely no counter wind out of the federal government - this is the most important desire of voting dampers.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz heads the party, the fundamental change has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the staff from the Willy-Brandt-Haus is characterized by an astonishment the events in the SPD-regained state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year, its headwind would not be described above.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were deep signs.</seg>

<seg id="2632">The surprise leader of a Green-elected president, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) was overthrown into a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the Parliament election, his red-green coalition lost their voices to the opposition from the CDU and FDP's opposition.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The green-German managing director Michael Kellner summoned to return the charitable Green-member Elke Tsar, to return to their mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2640">And no one knows what next comes.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miser started a significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>

<seg id="2644">It was then - and everything was well worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD in the stroll, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Laboried, the comrades reformed in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just had exhausted new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him the next draurash came.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD farming, lost his Nimbus in that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie during his town.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication, then everything that is wrong, what can be done wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz is fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Well, Stephan Weil, too.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW emission affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for longer.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Lesions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps just therefore, because in the past few weeks, Weil still tried to set accents in the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The taxation of the former Mayor of Hanover, made up his power in Berlin, remained not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him give, since they promised a stabilization of the party.</seg>

<seg id="2661">While the genders are due to stop, the comrades must be closed in order to keep their own rows.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their wrath adapts to the green, and here especially on the revolving parliamentarians in Tsar.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democracies, such as Mrs. Tarranges their own career on interests of all other countries," says Matthias Miersch, chief of partitions in the SPD Bundestag and the editorial network of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Ms. Tarrant was not elected to Parliament by her person as a direct-candidate, but on the national list of Lower Saxony for the Lower Saxony.</seg>

<seg id="2676">Back then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg adopted two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the supplement was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous sanitation are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only to develop new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, 2005, the government of the government of Karlsruhe will receive information that there will be a reorganisation.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total amount amounts to 833 333 Euros, 500 000 of which come from the country, the rest of the community.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a sanction process now arise?</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2720">"I only wanted to know that, because there is an unusual event with great visibility," the Commander of the HMx-1 wrote on the eve of the event of the preset, the Deputy Naval Command for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 15: 00 pm and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second team would need for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the event, the original aircrew was under the helicopter while security personnel remained on the plane while the airplane remained on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The records relating to the TIME was not clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The National Bank Act has given the Federal Government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets show that HMx-1 has asked if the event may hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"one question that we asked if there was an injury to the Brands Hatch and we were informed about that this was not the case," he wrote Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are closed," the Deputy Commandant.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>

<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers is determined on the basis of estimates for renewal rates, is highly respected," said Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the funding."</seg>

<seg id="2896">"the accustomed to mark the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that" writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess of Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would like to go on to the church and that's a bounded fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, it pointed out that in her adolescence "Schlust had been a normal pedagogical means" to be ready to become ready. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use today standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about misuse cases, Pope John Georg Ratzinger was also available.</seg>
<seg id="2901">It is entirely wrong, author and historian Michael Eemann, who written with Ratzinger the memory band "My brother of Pope." (translated in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to put Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that from the Bishopric of Regensburg, with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber, presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domain were sexually violated between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high Plausivity" victims of overweight people, 67 Domestic damages.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it was said to Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, saying: "summaries that by Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Just at high EMotonality the punishment for students could also be violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Contrary to many other documents, many victims were estimated to reflect the general crimes of humanity and therefore, in many cases, it is even positive and positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Eemann, why the final report of the Celestial cathedral of Georg Ratzinger was relieved in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Non-violence against the Domenburger Domspatzen" is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For an lifting many students, out of their "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears to be used as Choleriker and Perfection, even if a domain spice has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you achieve this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask oneself rather, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">To him, eight pages are devoted to him and it is clear from any suspicion or co-violent in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The force of violence at the preschool took place outside its operation sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can take him all if it is too late or first accusations not taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The cathedral-vacanymnasium in which he worked, was taken from practically all those questioned - as literally - "salvation," "sky" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, describes it as "hot-hearted", "very popular," "competent," and "understandful", as extremely high-level teachers, who provided boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and had always been surrounded by grapes of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about his perfectionism and its high motivity that led to wil already times.</seg>
<seg id="2920">He did not just cast only with chairs and cast the keys and on the floor, but also, earing guys on the hair, or ears, he has already regretted that he was sorry, and owes to it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honor, however, such educators have to be widespread in the unquestionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely used, with parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually happened in this report, namely, to escape sexual abuse and violence at the preschool, they are freilaterally.</seg>
<seg id="2926">This one asks, whether they were not rather to do with his acquaintiness and his role as a brother by Benedict XVI, that many media have just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood it, still eivelled.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relief Georg Ratzinger in all respects!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media this report was reported much about misuse at the Regensburger Domnoons in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is placed in the final report any processing or mitigship with regard to sexual abuse on load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Eemann: totally no. no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never knew that, with my father or my mother," I said that "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the declaration of sexual abuse was and is, however, most victims from shame silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not have parents and siblers, then quite definitely not a chorus master, who yet have been a certain colleague of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen students' Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Eemann: a questionable student formulated this way: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have had timely insights and could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, assume that... Buying urgent or clearer, or rather, as opposed to their parents, internatrafts, confidentials, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report says to the very clear result: "that in advance of the affected pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the examination."</seg>
<seg id="2942">Affecting sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is talking about everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be accused him, not prevented or transferred to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these terrible crimes, as it was in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "violence to read" during the Regensburger Domnoons.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is being thrown in the "signposted" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this design?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mentions to a huge melange from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separately: between the preschool and the grammar school, between sexual abuse and violence, we say even, other occasions.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report has been treated from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The full horrible test education, the cases, in which boys from sadistic teachers were regularly ashamed and had trained, happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skillous states must have dominion.</seg>
<seg id="2953">Yet, with whom, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only on his face, as they were already at the nasium-set nasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, as the very most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be coming to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraes" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the nasium-nymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Eemann: since there was discipline but no seasonal violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims are estimating the general crimes of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So no more the allegation remains in the front.</seg>
<seg id="2960">Yet, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported to him from the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and carried out by the predecessors at a school where he had not been active and responsible, (as the witness) didn't want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Shut down Georg Ratzinger from the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Eemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzymnasium, which was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this respect, he pointed out that in the incident, the examining penalty will continue to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative press coverage he invassigns urgent effects.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course, at a time as legal clarity, as a test brewing had been banned in Bavaria since.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it took in a legal greyzone, just as everybody knows about us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was too much appreciated for him, where the affected may have been exaggerated or drafted, and where the admissible line had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have failed.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not so easy.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the testing of the schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess of Thurn and Taxis maintained yes, it was infair to use today's pedagogical standards on that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Eemann: we are talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," thus the danger that pertaining to today's morale's standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There has been the principality in law.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is true of course not for sexual abuse, who was abhable to all times and not for what was broken in the preschool on resistors and violence to innocent children, that goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awesome and I'm glad that it is finally reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to put Georg Ratzinger at the same time, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and Punishment, so earing and listen to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment then was forbidden, it also kept strict about it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his Regensburger time created Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope."</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic of DUT in the language too?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Eemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells its perspective, as the Cathedral sparrows played a side part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not conceal that he led a stringent regiment to there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this must be said to be once again: without these perfectionism, it would have hardly been possible to form any nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen a institution of Weltrang, true cultural ambassador Europe and his musical tradition, which went to tour two times in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone one makes out of rebellious child once more big singer and in front of any success, just in which area, but still discipline, passion and selfishness.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what a man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger at the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Eemann: thanks to work on the book and beyond that I really learned George Ratzinger, and always experienced a wonderful, humorful, fundamental, deep-believers and hearty people, from which one could not imagine that he could do anything just a fly?</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get acquainted with how many former domain names are still alive today, 23 years after his Emergency Policy, attend to him regularly to inform him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him today that he was strictly speaking to them, are therefore unique in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of them are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always is a good, vuternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but nevertheless a favorite respectful thing, to which they still watch it and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, once again clearly stated: everything that were given to him are educational methods that were then on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time since.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's most unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and a more prominent brother has become a medial sin-bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind him only too.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of affairs would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits without being outside of Bavaria and maybe in Germany, nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
