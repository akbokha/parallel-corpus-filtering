Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pil@@ es of stones
his experiences on the horse are over@@ man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a first appearance for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold sport pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses stood at their closing ceremony , they hunt for the fast gal@@ lop of home to the food .
one kilometer at this speed , I have dre@@ amt .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thereby the e@@ quest@@ rian career then ended again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - back near horses .
he left his family over the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not lie down to photo records .
the first time in Aachen , this was also the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports assistance was presented to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala &apos;s Golden Sport@@ pil@@ es .
at awards , it is not lacking the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Federal Cross of Cross , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ra@@ ged him .
the 18th winner of the pil@@ es of the pil@@ es of stones .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; these &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he gave also the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more excellent sports athletes , the second @-@ fold US @-@ pole winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ge and Harald Schm@@ itt , the Turner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ der Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard Distribut@@ or , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spr@@ inters Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously wonderful Erhard .
many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society emigrated to the Spring@@ field where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept space for the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure , the trade agreement T@@ TP prevent to prevent Clinton as well as tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are subject to tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
view of the state &apos;s role .
Tr@@ ump wants to hold in doubt very small in doubt , as the state of the economy does harm - with tax and regulation .
Clinton sl@@ ug@@ ged the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
himself on the other hand it would be different , claimed to be Tr@@ ump .
he will decrease regulatory deposits , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and businesses .
Clinton said to prevent : the state has appointed certain tasks to open the disabled chances and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
to the fact , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are nearly equal .
the democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the government &apos;s national apart@@ ament wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so you could listen to part@@ iti@@ an internal discussions .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power stations and drive coal hydr@@ ates in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in the protected areas so far as he wants to termin@@ ate the climate protection agreement in Paris .
Clinton wants to strengthen the renewable energies with their investment program , and calls for : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , both competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the Dat@@ azi@@ de trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
they are then to be paid better , subject to Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger re@@ mun@@ eration .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what you want to do in this question isn &apos;t clear : once he says : the minimum wage should be down , then he says he will not be changed .
however , the large discussion of the next months is probably more likely to develop the control policy of both bearings .
on the one side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to strain the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who want to ask at least of the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics saying : more tax are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every living woman has gained experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who have fled almost everyday .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a big kitchen .
everyone has a baby , that is not one year old .
one has put her small son in the arm .
he gu@@ ises with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ ving onto the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iling short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live at the Munich north , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs established the institution together with a Sagrada Familia and Munich &apos;s contribution .
it has been un@@ long since it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there is no man - not as a visitor .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here comes on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted , because of them torture or death , or because their families are sending them as a hopes of their hopes in Europe , &quot; says it .
while women do not have any other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away from it , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in her hom@@ eland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced to col@@ oration , honour of honour , slavery , or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
they drive it off .
the escape goes on .
&quot; so , for example , tu@@ g for a bottle of water require sexual action , no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think the end as soon as they came in Germany , say , told us .
too , all women in refugee camps would often be regarded as a decrease in times and when mis@@ used .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the north of Munich , is sad .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; or they trusted not to speak openly about the earth , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often do not help to help , there &apos;s more accommodations just for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they w@@ alled from a similar project such as in Munich in their jurisdiction , respond some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are not something in the governments of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , women are not accommodated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ ference for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are accommodations in some areas on the grounds or their own houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament is calling for women separately to be accommodated separately from men .
in a study published for the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated together , can come to - for@@ getting - violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and accessible for women easily , is in the study .
as very the women will feel the need of this protection , you can read the rush of rush on the house in Munich .
&quot; since it has been talking about that there are us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
it could easily arise a second house .
assistance in Assist@@ ance : recei@@ v@@ ables due to new jobs
Deputy agent of the assist@@ ants have called to their union to tackle new workers strug@@ gles with their disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire Council , from the beginning of September more working amp@@ le@@ urs .
the J@@ DC said that there were ministers to go to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have been adapted to the re@@ jection of a contract signed by the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the election .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Mc@@ Court , said the government had remained quiet &quot; to cause problems that the contract was rejected .
she said : &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC board has voted to completely re@@ ject the proposed new treaty and requested official talks about all the concerns . &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has set up a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of calendar campaign , beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in that assistance should strike this year six times , the first overall accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ sts , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , according to the election of the agreed Terms , had been recommended by the BM@@ A , according to information forwarded by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which was still held before the vote by 54@@ .000 assistant doctors and medical students , with that the contract was advant@@ age@@ ous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jeremy Hunt told us that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of foreign workers &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and the official end of the eight months of the war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin grants his Turkish counter@@ players in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot hide myself from the pres@@ cription that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation .
there was the r@@ ash , yes .
but Put@@ into smile had a nar@@ rower and ir@@ radi@@ ated heat , even for his return conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , said &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve themselves .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had claimed to work as though , would never be something worse .
it seemed to me about the opposite to me .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant vision showed that Russia &apos;s state of affairs did not forget Russia .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to elect in his execution : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was sore burning .
Putin turned out and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back .
the ver@@ ge was even larger , since it was committed by a friend friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will be difficult when not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ conditional attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed to be the Turks what was the Turks .
the serious accus@@ ations from senior officials reported that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family could have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he made this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was , that it was time to look forward to the front .
finally this meeting took place only because Putin was given to exc@@ use Putin by the President Erd@@ og@@ an , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a sort of victory .
the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clearly on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is required primarily in the first line of all friends who can receive , after the last month he was at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
Russian sanctions were hard hit in Turkey - especially the prohibition of char@@ ters who usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and char@@ ities will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they are counting on a late ais@@ ant of the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecasts fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agricultural waste will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists for long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West since it was the reaction to power in power as a weak answer .
the lasting Gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - it turns out to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
Russian president won a bonus gained in Ankara with safety that he called for a coup d &apos;@@ etat for the chosen state of state .
that is a self @-@ understood for Moscow to change the self @-@ sitting fear of Reg@@ im@@ e@@ change .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace made it possible by Russia and Turkey , one , as it was described to me a analy@@ tics once : two countries that will drive away from the West and are po@@ or@@ ly treated by the West .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two still .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peac@@ eke@@ eping force , but where Russia and Turkey support each other pages .
it might be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference they said that they would not take the topic once more .
the President of Turkey for@@ ged it inten@@ tionally to a question about their dis@@ agreements , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize it .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator may be found in Syria .
but after months , open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , as the NATO member of Turkey &apos;s Russian mar@@ tial jet - it certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
according to the Board of Staff of the Bank , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a Back@@ office role more on a Back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global ambul@@ ance .
the bench has been dist@@ anced since then , when she was almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
at this time , brand new R@@ BS &quot; brand have used to protect other end consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with million pounds of Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to draw more national brands in focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange will switch to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller stamps for the private customer business to receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is being one of our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand , as well as the brand to be employed among our employees , since we are now more into a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now , we don &apos;t want to pursue global targets , but local objectives .
every of these brands will stand in their own municipalities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customer .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing anymore and that it will increase the truth of various brands in its Sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop themselves to the bank of the stamps , as we are looking inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of directors .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical before three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think there will be many changes .
we can start these stamps again , therefore I think that the time has come .

Russia &apos;s Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin was un@@ expect@@ edly released to his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov has been part of the general confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin , many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Special .
in an opinion of Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin have ordered his duties &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of his duties as the chair of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ous administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy deputy chairman since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was later prot@@ ested and Chief of Staff of the Government .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the main task of government to support your activity as a state of Staff to bills and controls to implement your statements .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked his position to leave his position and recommended to V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ aded the sm@@ iling faces ?
this stage has been mysteri@@ ously in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov had long been one of the closest confi@@ denti@@ sts Vladimir Putin and works as he has been working for Soviet Intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast@@ ed in television on television , both men re@@ treated that Chief of Staff is on his own request .
but despite the differentiation for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so , here is the consequence of a kind of power ?
I currently knows that .
but the official statement - that a man who once glorified as a potential President once glorified as the Russian environmental policy would have met on large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the Website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you to put forward to this very complicated item - you could almost say - to trust in a post for four years .
as it emerged , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov has taken the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin was a former member of the Security Council of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the German @-@ Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov has been appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power he became the one of five people , whom he trusted at most .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could have been President of Putin after putting him to the second term of Putin , as a third term of Putin was beaten against the Constitution .
but this item was taken by another , near allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin has became prime minister before he became president of three and a half years later .

it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 tons of concrete .
the cost of £ 1.@@ 35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
the German Minister , Keit@@ h Brown , took part in the building site today and was one of the first to go out of the country on the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing . &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a home activities that require extremely precise tolerances for fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the whole bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete finish for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted along the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , Project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first seal is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the tr@@ end@@ setting high and deep building represents .
after installation of the last street cover and its connection with the North@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the North or Land@@ scape .
this was achieved by dra@@ g@@ ging the Northern Re@@ duc@@ er Bridge 700 millimeter south .
it was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved with an incline of approximately 3 % .
hei@@ d as the tolerances , which the team works , were tiny - on each side it was only a few millimeters .
fortunately all went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men still have to be alive !
three men , &quot; happiness still to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed the event on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security , while her boat looked behind her own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat was near by himself , and set us the worst of us , &quot; said leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach , until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third person was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a suspension without li@@ fe@@ jacket .

som@@ ebody said today about these men .
seriously wounded - man @-@ drawing on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked and severely damaged his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police hur@@ ried yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get to get his personal things .
instead of soft @-@ alcohol use the clothes to his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend instead .
when they came into the flat , he stopped twice on her .
44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm his brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
so she went with her life in the house .
on the road they met the explosion of explosion of man .
when the two women entered the apartment once again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ ly cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green My : investors are expected to be much stronger in the future .
how can I respond to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose close to 1300 budget apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a &quot; hand@@ ful concept housing . &quot;
but the dispute is programmed .
in the first line it is about the question : who is supposed to build the low @-@ priced apartments ?
a regulation is still missing .
leader , Christoph Brat@@ mann , said : &quot; we are pleased with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments have to come out as social apartments . &quot;
however , the favourable apartments can also occur in the continu@@ ance .
however , the great contro@@ vers@@ y in the town hall is , however , so viol@@ ate : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments . &quot;
a new city of housing , the million cost will cost and will be funded , scheduled to take care of incen@@ tives .
the problem , so viol@@ inist : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors a few regulations as possible .
the lin@@ k@@ ke wants to have hardness conditions for investors .
regardless of what , as fr@@ ying , the situation asked for a deep@@ ening of the situation in the housing market .
the project concept is implemented and will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will receive skilled workers .
but the program does not fully understand : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , that should be certainly not built .
how did you get the loss of another around 1300 professional apartments that will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , such as the plann@@ er spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to go back into the price list .
this is possible in the western city .
a blow would solve the problem .
it remains at the end of the year at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could take back home in the price of cheap apartments .
only that the owners , housing companies do not want .
because the number of social apartments in the West city is dra@@ stically increased , it is removed from the aim of the so @-@ called .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in only few quarters .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be still movement in the discussion .
Group Chair Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; a wide majority must have the CDU with the boat . &quot;
this can be concentrated on more places for family homes .
but what does not mean , not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating , as the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child for playing no longer go outside , but rather prefer@@ able to spend their free time to spend on screens , was used in the last decade of many .
with Pok@@ em@@ on Go to get people from the sofa and get more active .
the time on screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities can not exclu@@ de each other .
I build myself of course at the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters , which were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop culture sank the interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
its market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players are looking forward to their smartphone outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons looking for a GPS , once they were found once , &quot; photographs &quot; ( over a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; can be captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was yet younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search from the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that determines the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ jk , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent each day .
the company does not know who play Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the performance increase .
many public conn@@ aissance campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; 30 minutes to come &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day will be active on a de@@ af ears because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and come to people who look like .
nevertheless , the importance of sport does not exceed sport .
those who regularly exercise sports , reduces its chances to get cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that are too long to view it here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is for people to do something in the open , that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close the hunt for new friends .
as always there is also m@@ ute games that must always compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone may walk against a door .
what is it meant to be ?
it is a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had already been able to follow our activity as Fit@@ bit , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
the new will lose his ri@@ z and use it with time .
due to poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that can join apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , and helping to help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the imm@@ un .
dynamic on the jumping competition .
effortlessly on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on all line .
and now the Olympi@@ an woman now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to several occasions and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clear before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze sculpture Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es on the Swe@@ des during the individual promotion of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ os@@ exual US Americans , who win a combined events and a total of the fifth , while they were in their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and their long journey was at the end .
it is this success in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports cards to new heights :
Bil@@ ly dominated its sports art , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , which said the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary L@@ ou rescue on her , that she has ever seen &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ist that I ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to last a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ ell@@ ished because they each have won gold and silver in the single majority of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while she served at the f@@ are@@ well celebration of team coordinator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a ru@@ ding sign .
although it existed on its long way to the top , never planned the future , it &apos;s not really true .
a part of their ground exercises - which include the typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is aimed at the Latin American music that would fit in the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child , adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became strength .
she has no longer been lost since the summer of 2013 , a winning series which will hold so long as it wishes .
even if the pattern has slightly led through two turns , the picture stopped .
sulph@@ ur@@ ks and soil particles - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - l@@ ur@@ ly .
she repeated with 15,@@ 433 on the j@@ ig @-@ beams and put it on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ race her gentle as she had her du@@ ck - a pure shape - and tears run on Bil@@ g@@ shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , than the vision , which once was described in her collection book .
the Ra@@ is@@ mans power was ven@@ geance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Captain of Team , who is called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after his retirement , they threw an audience of Kus@@ ad@@ ena , being overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared in doubt .
as it concerns , the fast @-@ spread of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims killed in series mur@@ der@@ ers at the car
according to the police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who were killed in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first serial mur@@ der@@ fall of Phoenix , while they were in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked at an entrance , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire@@ weapon , while lying on the front of the car and fled then with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police divided that the triple murder does not seem to have the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over all , since the attack@@ ers did not carry the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of an adult victims .
the police pre@@ ver of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at how it is linked with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residence had been killed within four months in nine attacks of seven people and two others viol@@ ated .
&quot; in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , Howard , the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , took part in the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to off@@ end the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were committed and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised with her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ked car .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which had an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found patron saint and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ biological : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the least of his age@@ ing has Edmund Micro@@ cer@@ ess , the result of a genetic disorder , about whom his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I made it not .
I will not create it .
I did not leave me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband became aware that Edmund they can never realize her under circumstances that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they beat him to be institu@@ tional@@ ized .
&quot; my first answer to &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund could run with help of a assistance .
Edmund could neither marry until his age of 3 nor are still cra@@ w@@ ling and he still cannot speak .
but it makes slow progress .
he can run with assistance and cycling .
he also loves it to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we give him character language to &quot; telling Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character language -- says she . Edmund hasn &apos;t invented some characters alone .
micro@@ biology has a variety of causes : genetic how in Edmund Optics and infections with viruses as meas@@ les or z@@ ol@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect living with the z@@ ic@@ av@@ irus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional prices of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time more after the forecast , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the z@@ ic@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainfall , tor@@ r@@ ations gives lead to Res@@ cue in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rain @-@ floo@@ ding and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the Govern@@ or to call on Friday the emergency . it will be reck@@ oned with more rainfall on Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ ian@@ as and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is over@@ floo@@ ded their bank and threatened with great floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National weather Service .
the Govern@@ or of Louis@@ iana John Bel Ed@@ wards shared that state agents are standing in constant contact with local authorities and was already on the way to the affected congregations .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared that the requests for flood cars , boats and sand bags multiply .
Ste@@ ele said that the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand years of sand .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south Louis@@ ian@@ as until Saturday .
the weather service would be able to drop an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in the south al@@ ab@@ aster , a Fl@@ ut@@ n@@ aval system was deployed on Friday , while it continues to rain in the area of Mobile .
the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Louis@@ iana , all probability is reached after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream @-@ downstream crossing into A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will run only slowly in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river No St@@ fa@@ w , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , state border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest status in Friday around 9@@ am .
rescue teams still ad@@ ored people from floods Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the South@@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Le@@ Roy H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and step@@ son , were among those who were saved by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water is provided by Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rising over night .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives in the vicinity , war@@ ns him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it got my wa@@ ist .
his wife said on H@@ ans@@ ford that she had lived there in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a high level of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford told that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be able to swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ e@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were cared for by Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , because there continued heavy rain fail@@ ures , and in fact the authorities evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation assign@@ ments .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , there was an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floor has been substantially completed by the rain since Wednesday .
the authorities said that heavy rain workers and roads floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants out of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five shoul@@ ders .
the C@@ BS subsidiary EM@@ L reported that a sub@@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which now floo@@ ded both .
the ruler of the congregation of Ro@@ bby Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Ham@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa became closed almost two dozens of streets due to floo@@ ding and sand bags for the residents which hope to hold the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood we had in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the municipal administration .
that seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ n , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ess told us that it continues to rain at the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses have been reported on Thursday as floo@@ ded but they were not reported until now .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water at places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still exists . &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; Made by balls , &quot; survived in a shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was placed in Philadelphia , this week had already been the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia when Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several shots , including in the L@@ ending , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport to hospital in consciousness .
&quot; he did a lot of his body , his tiny body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boy was diagnosed in a hospital as critical and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boys divided the transmitter to be back again .
he had to begin the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable condition .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who found itself in a critical condition , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police currently resear@@ ched if there could be one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators used C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been tra@@ ced up to various storm carri@@ ages .
it seems that there are clearly st@@ ained about a ste@@ ady struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the go , the envelop@@ es were on the sides .
thus there have been several armed fighters to have been involved , who were very actively involved in the police , Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di , the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently reviewed reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross ra@@ cket , when she played in front of her house in the residential district of the West White Lane .
they recovered and the police still looks after a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present at the gym@@ nas@@ ium in the Tur@@ ns and that is more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been on the Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gym@@ n@@ uns , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who is inspir@@ ing for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of these crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Aven@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ kin is round , makes all proud .
this crew finally reflects the USA .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
over the past four years , the number one under female Tur@@ ner@@ o was a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas celebrated his last Olympic Champions and America at the last Olympic Games .
now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible power of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ ans .
on Thursday , Simone was awarded the fourth , heter@@ os@@ exual US Americans , who gained gold medal for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but they do not see turn@@ around classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to make it the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four gym@@ n@@ uns in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a Train@@ ee .
but the reality is that turns a more expensive sport , and Turner at first line in private gym@@ nast@@ ies that will be reck@@ oned by parents that will come from parents , competition and hotel charge ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can continue to continue .
the majority of these turn@@ key are in high @-@ hab@@ itable suburbs that support the business .
the Turner is their complete training and that is for families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started with the tower .
we have to be inspired by the municipalities of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an excellent and easy @-@ to @-@ reach exercise .
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
we offer free and affordable tour@@ neys in Harlem for more than 15.000 people ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) in Harlem for more than 15.000 people ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to meet the youth high quality exercises that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .

&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , lifting up and wor@@ ries the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he did not do this , so the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform more work action .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost from nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , as n@@ urses and medical doctors were involved in order to allow doctors in the strike @-@ side cover .

the £ 2 per day drug , the heart rate of heart attack can lower
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug , after by the authorities recommended to date this more people for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ man@@ ag@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of recur@@ ring heart attacks to people with a cardi@@ ac disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .

the regulatory authority N@@ ICE for the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year intake , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer from a heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by att@@ itudes of fet@@ al material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form the flo@@ or@@ ings .
when the layer breaks out , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots that caused the blood flow to the heart and therefore caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolved , it can flow through the bloo@@ d@@ stream and caused the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk to have a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the UK company A@@ stra@@ c@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ ana , reduces this risk by preventing the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the work design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month in@@ gest@@ ion of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily dose of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Regulations Committee said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people suffered from heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - mainly the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the application design recommends no treatment that goes over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness lets it flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the occasion of a government report because of corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness had led to that by far more widespread voting rights was wi@@ ped out in Muslim municipalities like a devastating government report today .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es emb@@ ell@@ aged the police , election observation and coun@@ cill@@ or to have evidence of election mis@@ use due to &quot; reviews of eth@@ no and religion &quot; .
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , which is now a Ant@@ corrupt candidate , said that it should be permitted by pressing voters from religious mot@@ ives so that the police should be allowed to set up tapes out of elec@@ toral M@@ igh@@ s to protect them .
he recommends that voters should take a identification with him to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a elec@@ torate has to call for his name and address .
the report proposes un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person when she cho@@ oses her voting to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should obtain more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by non @-@ official com@@ missions or work@@ groups .
&quot; this is not just for election , but also the municipal government had to protect corruption and financial culture , that will help protect it , he said .
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a special regional court decided that the am@@ arian mayor of Lut@@ on was supposed to be found after a lit@@ an@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Tribunal found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical manner and that he had brought his critic with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ b@@ ien@@ an@@ alleg@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is a religious duty of Muslims to choose Him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a desc@@ endant , if one person cho@@ oses another person .
Sir Eric said that it would be evidence of fr@@ aud in all the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent brie@@ fing for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent pres@@ election - for the older members of the Muslim community , they had to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including guidance to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as evidence , pressure on protective needs of some ethnic min@@ orities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ en@@ ish background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behaviour because of &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; survi@@ vor@@ s regarding eth@@ no@@ never and religion could be igno@@ red . &quot;
Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists will be informed promp@@ ting &quot; cho@@ oses . &quot;
the report , which is drawn up by Ther@@ esa May , is demanded even harder registration checks , in order to prevent the elec@@ torate @-@ up of immigration and social sheets .
options to consider that voters should ask for your identification before the election .
non removable ink on the finger of a person when she has given her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review of over the nationality of a person to make sure they are authorized .
a tri@@ enni@@ al limitation on request to an automatic brie@@ f@@ code .
prohibition to process political activists and envelop@@ es from the sheet for political activists .
the police have to set up the powers , put out dis@@ appoint@@ ments around election stations .
a amendment to which an indictment was ligh@@ tened in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983 ( Human Rights Act , 1983 ) .
Phot@@ ograph@@ ers banned in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in elec@@ toral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
inten@@ ving of the training , to ensure that employees usually make sure that voters leave the elec@@ toral cabin alone .
Sir Eric falling over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no penalty .
&quot; the election court , Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , and his deputy , declared to corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ sible , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons for reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
he critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of elec@@ toral registration departments .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country bears as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud legacy , yet the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of elec@@ toral fr@@ aud and le@@ aching of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympi@@ as@@ athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come this week via the French wheel house Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot apart from edge and band who has proven itself as an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ an in this summer is far not the only one to having gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not when you give the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens F@@ lim@@ mers , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ ad reviews which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celebr@@ ities .
the w@@ olf and the Wolf : team member of the US team at the Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo in Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ run@@ way many people were on the internet , like a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o might be .
the team member of the US team at the Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures where he fore@@ sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in secret .
in fact the Ar@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in the social media with and said that he had already been listening to his childhood he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , the bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post distributed .
&quot; he is a good fore@@ se@@ er guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will be und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly higher this year : the growing simil@@ arity between the British broad@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast in Ali@@ ya Pat@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes is said to go through the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African flo@@ at Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison since years .
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the theater acting
a further consecutive comparison was bred between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h hard , which is similar to severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ ail@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than the sun@@ ba@@ ited skin and bl@@ on@@ des hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan said Adrian &apos;s fans , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial shape and eyes
not the only one thing : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy that others are the simil@@ arity of the simil@@ arity .
1 . theory : according to this user , there may be a reason to the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter ut@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet think that Hope and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact the US football star Hope gave Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar fac@@ ial form and eyes .
another popular cham@@ fer@@ ed Ker@@ ry Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile that is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile that is similar to bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ D@@ onal@@ ds thought that his microphone is off to give his own views at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ator@@ ial team of C@@ BS , could hear more &quot; color &quot; could we hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
finally , as M@@ ief , she died like a pi@@ g .

Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ ther , &quot; Hat the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ at from China &quot; like a pi@@ g died &quot; ? ? ? ?
the I@@ di@@ ot didn &apos;t ren@@ ounced that they were still on con@@ sign@@ ment . &quot;
Ai Y@@ an@@ han from China was described as a result for women in the final 4 x 200m of exemp@@ tions for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which many of them released
Twitter @-@ User didn &apos;t look back when they heard how un@@ sen@@ si@@ bly Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like c@@ assi@@ sts . # requested .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who had hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live , was broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast@@ ed for a swimming performance . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate declaration of formulation , it &apos;s sorry that it happens . &quot;
C@@ BC exc@@ uses over 90 times at the end of the people who had responded to the comments about Twitter
the comment @-@ mate Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ use in more than 90 other Twitter ways , which had worth reading about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and issued a message .
we regre@@ t it right that these statements were made and it was made possible to be broadcast@@ ed .
we spent yesterday night quickly with our viewers on the broadcast and our followers on the social media .
in order to create one , Byr@@ ons comments related to the performance of the flo@@ at and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ fortun@@ ate declaration of formulation . Byron asked what he said , was sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was in the broadcasting and tried his re@@ mark to just@@ ify his re@@ mark that it was not his intention that it was designed to be a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to take me for the comment which I made after women &apos;s cre@@ w@@ elling in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said .
&quot; I did not refer to the performance of the flo@@ at and not on them as a person . &quot;
of course , there was no cont@@ emp@@ t , and I &apos;m sorry . &quot;

the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went off in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try teaching .
in order to avoid the situation , she numbered them , as she saw it , and laid it back into the shelf .
she h@@ un@@ ts and tried four pairs of sub@@ tro@@ users in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business of the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the lower p@@ ants before they put them back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who had been at the same time at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tast@@ ed the under@@ wear , she felt again and left the business without buying him . &quot;
she said , &quot; We could not believe what they saw . &quot;
at the middle of the sale surface , she took a couple of sub@@ tro@@ users from the outside , moved its own bus@@ hes and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t tried to find a more discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like Oskar . &quot;
&quot; every star@@ ring when they with@@ drew the spirits , which you obviously didn &apos;t like to cast them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more p@@ ants before she finally decided that her eye did nothing , and went down and r@@ ushed out .

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a saf@@ er place for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers at hand .
ir@@ respective of whether you approach either from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to rotate the spe@@ ar .
if you are rec@@ ted from behind , you should make sure that you can see your attack@@ ers , so that you can see your attack@@ ers &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you h@@ itting it with your free ell@@ bow to face .
then turn him down with the kne@@ e to the dead and turn up , while the attack@@ ers shake off pain and turn off the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards , while they set the weapon on it .
for attack@@ ers who approach themselves from the front , the technique is similar to move your body from the Line , take the weapon and turn them , so the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot anything .
lay at the same time the weight on the gun and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle before moving back@@ wards and raise the weapon .
sounds difficult ?
see the video about how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a cra@@ b at the saf@@ est , your money is too rich - if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Travel@@ er Ian Wright for a guide with his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British traveler under@@ nour@@ ished the immune system and saus@@ age at a serious examination - having failed some of the most dirty and most poll@@ uted places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travelling or Ian Wright , 51 , out of Suff@@ olk will cope with a rail@@ ing pot of mig@@ rat@@ ory toilet and a public telephone in Russia to proof the resistance of its immune system .
before leaving any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he will leave .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought to pull the flush @-@ kno@@ b of a pull @-@ out toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sp@@ ans .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he ab@@ le@@ red , more than a bad breath in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines by going through the world as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ing sho@@ ots up to r@@ ins@@ ing toilets , the task set its immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a kid I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have set all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in his film , he was justified in his sight .
the only thing that he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ome @-@ number is fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet to ref@@ using to ref@@ using their lumin@@ ance of 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a lower than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different locations like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this is the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m not an@@ cho@@ red here because it is in@@ scri@@ bed here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ filtr@@ us that contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria , as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
validation of Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
a little bit fascinating to the watch and at the same time the advantages of Pro@@ biotics &quot; was declared .
we conducted mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , so that we said &quot; L@@ ass call us Ian . &quot;
they asser@@ t that interest in intest@@ inal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just over the products , we wanted to present them into a greater context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is linked with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary could provide the consumer &apos;s consumer more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directed , said : &quot; let me say that - I had lost my respect for Ian , if he had chosen some of the things I have told him , as the English Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to bring them , and others , where it was pretty difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty le@@ ak@@ eup on film . &quot;
in a validation survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents in lac@@ tic acid bacteria are particularly associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products that contain the lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
ash social family Dest@@ ru@@ ed before Del@@ og@@ ation Private flat in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 because she had terror@@ ized their neigh@@ bors .
Tan@@ ya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of dis@@ comfort of their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from her property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing co@@ operative had the property in an ir@@ rever@@ ent condition .
the walls were torn down , wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s were torn down , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was ador@@ ned to the walls .
the family moved around and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the household administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it is not possible to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of the Corn@@ ger .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the pair had three sons , who lived in the flat in the flat and the police said that the terror , who had added the family , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ps , and exc@@ essive cry .
Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , received an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior in June .

the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered from facilit@@ ated neigh@@ bors who said that their lives has been made for hell .
one said : &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the inn@@ um@@ erable times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because there was so quiet - that &apos;s not usual !

that was a very difficult situation since the behavior was extremely difficult and to view their deeds for their neigh@@ bor .
I guess all the work , which my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the congregation , have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the information we have done .
I hope that this evolution will be comfort and the message is convey@@ ed that ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .

Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ spatial ″ mighty problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the Republi@@ can High Castle Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ contained Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire as something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having cast 16 ri@@ vals in his own republi@@ can camp , the doub@@ ts now grow to his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Protestant Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can High Bur@@ ns W@@ ack@@ ing
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank for Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , according to Tr@@ ump and his competitors from the Democrat , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump on the front , but not with the distance , which are common for Republi@@ can nom@@ inees in the state of State .
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be end@@ anger@@ ed .
in an interview in the transmitter CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump on the question how to stop the march of Clin@@ t again : &quot; the same as I have done so far . &quot;
and if you are back : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he don &apos;t make anything else to tell about &quot; the truth . &quot;
if there is no hat@@ red for him in the end for reasons of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it was fine , so Tr@@ ump went on .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump should have threatened to submit funds to support his elec@@ toral campaign , he should not be able to present no better conversion values .
instead of whose wool , the candidates of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can take stronger taking part under the arms .

as a consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control conform to the rules of WA@@ DA .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community calcul@@ ates with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever does not fit and ple@@ dges to be praised , sits on the packed mon@@ ies , &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in short term , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects the short term to escape from Turkey to Germany with tens of thousands of protection .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the band leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the tough presentation of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of vacc@@ ination from Turkey in Germany with tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight the minority interests and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k in the world &quot; from Friday .
because the government already had out@@ law@@ ed high bur@@ dens ( 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey during the months before months ) .
after the failed p@@ utsch of the p@@ utsch was still sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal Turks were added .
many will be able to start in Europe when they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes place for refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
they accused the targeted treatment of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ian cities .
therefore , Erd@@ og@@ an increase the travel pressure to the remaining cur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were cut off or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member .
the Federal Minister of Defence asked that the Federal Government stands as &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot;
one of the &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt has been held against Erd@@ og@@ an critics in Germany also in Germany .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ary .
the fire mark@@ er than quality supporters are destroyed by teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ og@@ ents praise , sits on the pack@@ ers , sits on the back@@ pack@@ ers , also said the K@@ em@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already set up the largest group of political asylum in Germany because of political persecution in Germany .
at the reporting date June 30 , this will be 11.@@ 386 people and thus just under 29 percent of all known as as@@ yl@@ are accepted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
this survey will not exist before war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum seek@@ eth according to the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , thus from state side , individual adjustment .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; at that time , where to do it &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : loc@@ als get nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
by 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the monastery has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for so far as far as you don &apos;t go : summer vacation , heat and land@@ slide combat - that will bite .
the loc@@ als that are to be convinced by the elec@@ toral boxes are on vacation .
most tourists who are in the countryside are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not domestic , so you may not choose the country .
to this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , distribut@@ ing air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and ch@@ oked at the end of the vote , just lab@@ ors .
until September 4 , 2016 , the elec@@ toral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave the people just over the people over themselves .
the hot stage , if you can say that at all , just begun .
and it is also about something like Prime Minister , Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , has to do his position .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ st aug@@ ur@@ ly .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one can see from his posters .
he travels across the country , ro@@ ses ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ght a little with the people as it did already his legendary wor@@ t@@ ful predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise sail@@ ors will get cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel &apos;s gu@@ ilt on the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with their nick@@ name , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you want to get to wrong time at the right place election campaign .
she has been invited to major German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel &apos;s German Bundestag and Merkel has been in the northeast of Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of foreigners from other Länder , &quot; def@@ endant Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but there is a shame even from other corners of Germany to hear Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CDU largely ren@@ ounced the usual campaign distances on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
that &apos;s how co@@ ca@@ ine , games are still a minor role . &quot;
also the Union has noticed that you have to put away on the ground that it has to become very persistent , again a wire to the people .
you go like the Left , the SPD , the Green : in the times of the country it is hardly available .
however , the Council of the CDU elections to his fellow soldier is , however , self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you must go where there are people : Dor@@ n@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot in the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called up its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and only scar@@ cely in the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD was still al@@ lied with 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , may make the leap into the Parliament in the country .
they make a modern T@@ ug@@ end , a modern T@@ ug@@ end , and dis@@ gu@@ ise their suff@@ rage to be largely on the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is called the Chair Claudia Müller .
otherwise they give up green elec@@ ts to trace @-@ looking for loc@@ als looking for loc@@ als among the holidays .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ in , kur@@ t straight with a house boat through the Mecklenburg @-@ Limburg and finds it a beautiful place .
her impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : gas stations suffer under blocking
on the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to catch up .
for the leaders of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only around 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is always the praise .
&quot; they have made everything quite delicate , &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ e@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
that is a superb team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be shi@@ fted to the south at the weekend of October , by the end of October everything will be ready .
blessed is also the ab@@ brevi@@ ation of the responsible for the construction works , when it comes to the establishment of accommodation drives .
since the construction site on Monday to the south is v@@ elled and the re@@ jection of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was removed and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
the citizens now come from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen out of the B 27 on both sides .
the exp@@ ulsion of traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Director of the Rest@@ oration Assistant Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ el road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many battles were sought and more their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ posts .
what caused by some trucks in residence areas in Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the speed lim@@ es were not included in order to rein@@ force the forces from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were significant changes , &quot; says King , who himself made the location above the location itself .
there were already two to three per minute .
the liner was on the way with 77 km per hour at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become a quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business people do not have to look at the tickets .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to them to increase revenue qu@@ arri@@ es , everyone who asks you will look back .
however some more and some less are affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; has produced less for other companies and has hardly any consequences for the renovation .
even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no less decline , &quot; but also a , of course , &quot; the lear@@ ner is missing . &quot;
on the strongest were the local road along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , holds mark@@ edly .
this is already strictly threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all guest rooms have hit the &apos; hard . &quot;
we are missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ a we@@ dge .
we have to be glad about each Euro turnover .
the revenue fell by far to &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
road building took his operation &quot; by two years ago . &quot;
he must have dismissed half of his collabor@@ ators .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the host has benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it is also the dis@@ advantages taken by the san@@ itation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts , where something spacious has been handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family estate has already been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
it is possible to understand that other regular guests should be less frequent in less frequently due to the complicated transport management .
if you don &apos;t want to ride , it is also nice .
that his master cli@@ ent@@ ele rec@@ eded to the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner does not doubt any doubt .
despite the cr@@ ises of BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced his place in its long history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
the terrorist control in law is constantly smoking in the name of the terrorist control .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what did a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically reas@@ on@@ ably &quot; polit@@ ically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the introduction of his new security packages .
they want to challenge them .
other , further points would be discussed within the parties .
I also participation myself .
as the Minister of the Interior , however , he is situated on outcome and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the Coalition .
following the youngest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented a little time before transfer@@ ring his conclusions for security in the republic .
but these are however more extensive .
a lot is already familiar , announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the Kn@@ igh@@ ting encrypted communication is not new .
nor the fact that Germany must implement several EU regulations on flight information and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not sur@@ pris@@ ingly un@@ sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals to do so far with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ izers for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German pass .
&quot; that will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; the CDU of the CDU . &quot;
he still keep this for reasonable and challenging any thing that has no chances for the coalition partner .
a few new ideas to be presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in itself : it is planning quick procedures for shi@@ fts and more opportunities for detention in front of deportation .
refugees who are brought to target country , should check out their smart phones and make social media accounts for a security check .
when accept@@ ing asylum seek@@ ers he wants to present some even worse than before - such , the offen@@ ders go away or deliber@@ ate their papers in order to sei@@ ze their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legal .
man@@ ure works even un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ fed for example - is the question : what does that actually do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak in speaking , that the assassination of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ er@@ zburg there were refugees .
many people in the presence of the high refugee are wor@@ ried about security .
and things that are employed by people , now there were no wise chambers in election periods .
the inner safety is enormous throughout the focus .
just the suggestions in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach is then .
the dis@@ gu@@ arding is large .
and yes , there are elections .
Union and SPD leaders get increasingly on the topic of internal security .
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ st@@ worthy dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then establishing a security policy collection of some of the Unions &apos;s ministers , in which res@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also require a bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition and a return to double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lab@@ ors here for nar@@ row@@ able tones .
from a departure from the double pass he doesn &apos;t stop .
we satis@@ fying the discussion in Germany .
you newly elabor@@ ate , don &apos;t make sense .
and by a Bur@@ ka ban he did not enter any constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is valid at all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the coalition partner , it must still show itself .
there is a lot in what could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing on the topic of internal security .
Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized it with a careful meeting and said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to what to increase safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming through .
despite the diesel version , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it does not run in all markets .
when the feedback reaction there is host about a term .
Volkswagen starts with deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ boat can continue to present an increase in the previous year despite the diesel aff@@ air thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ ongoing markets .
but in July the core brand VW had particularly weaker in Western Europe and loaded the total sales , as explained in the D@@ ax company .
worldwide , the VW Volkswagen brand was sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars and 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries are increased by almost one sixth .
brand ambassador Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July prior to two sales days less in Europe .
Moreover , in some key markets , it was also given back on a non @-@ profit economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the withdrawal of withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where exhaust gas aff@@ aires initially es@@ cal@@ ated , is also further a min@@ us be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , mainly affected house stamp of Lower Saxony would continue through the diesel sc@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , only one delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
in January to July , the Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler was able to demonstrate a sales charts from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manip@@ ulated by a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW has about 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fitting the workshops .
in the wake of the re@@ arm@@ ament VW , the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects .
according to retro@@ fitting of the vehicles , it is equivalent to fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance .
the passenger arrives to the customer following their dis@@ arm@@ ament &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but did not talk of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was given on Friday in Corporate News .
the foundation of legal forms .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted his German customers yet a guarantee for new diesel models .
this was approved the last Monday of Monday by representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that it was this meeting .
&quot; VW has concluded the stip@@ ulations of my investig@@ ating committee and the KBA once again . &quot;
&quot; variations of that are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power after retro@@ fitting does not take any deteri@@ oration and all typical forms of relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was in corporate services .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen is the possibility that customers can come from a half year after retro@@ fitting for example with a motor damage in a workshop - and this could cause the new software to do nothing , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in the customer &apos;s interest it is important to avoid that with some other damages we have nothing to do with the ab@@ ass@@ al sc@@ and@@ al that comes to an im@@ assurance as possible warranty claims , such as it was called .
therefore , the term &quot; guarantee &quot; is not using .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund is requested at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see in the future of rich deposits in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
chief manager Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers that use 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily basis . &quot;
the Federal federation of German banks speaks of a single fall and sees no signal : regular savings would have to be afraid to pay for their savings penalty . &quot;
when banks hold money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay a 0.4 % penalty .
this fee is demanded by Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily payments .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will be charged 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he ski@@ pped 40 million euros for the past 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other and he could not be able to de@@ duce it .
&quot; those lying with me on the bank account and cause 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; said the banking manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs will continue to give it after the course principle .
the cash just in the Tres@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve never experienced four over@@ time , I don &apos;t even know the fifth ! &quot; said the banking board .
most of our customers have understanding and di@@ ver@@ ing different investment forms .
only few emigrated to other banks .
the co@@ operative association in Bavaria explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
it alone to bear , be &quot; Works economically vi@@ able not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank@@ roll , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal charges for deposits of € 3 million , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief managing director of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect to pay private customers on deposits with deposits , and in Germany the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele , which is equipped of the wealth of slightly l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; this can be the problem for a small bank if you feed for free money . &quot;
founded in 1911 , co@@ operative bench G@@ mund established two offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ager , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
the renowned actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs are living in the region .
there are currently no further banks in the Federal Co@@ operative federation of Bavaria , &quot; which will charge an out@@ set for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst .
the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had announced the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go out to the negative , is very high . &quot;
the competition was hard , and it was dro@@ pping the emig@@ ration of an@@ nex to the competition .

destination records : who do you buy records ?
lon@@ ely men of middle ages love plates .
before you are talking to comm@@ it@@ ments to ski@@ p him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ Al@@ le@@ an@@ vel@@ ous @-@ age age with har@@ sh claims , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , the reconstructed re @-@ formation of records are not looking forward to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the unity of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fore@@ sight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely fault group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby - it has a emotional meaning : older record runners retain their feelings more to themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy them alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I am in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest appearance that I stop , my hands hold and a little effort like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly getting to its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now fill into the building where independent seller is located - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the camera &apos;s camera to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various hus@@ bands in such shops and try to estimate her age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is it a collectors I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
this records , pictured above ( he sent to me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by home ) , clo@@ the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy boards that he could not aff@@ ord , when it was released and once more items he sold when he had been young and ple@@ xes .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably had to have something too young to buy them . &quot; he says .
it is true that those who buy plates , rather cho@@ ices and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I smoke not and I drink not much .
this is my aster .
We@@ z , 25 who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets You@@ Go@@ v profile will meet again .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and show to purchase their old records back again .
from the discussions that I have led , people usually have taken away their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy themselves , sell their CDs to purchase their records back again , &quot; says he .
this would explain the boom on tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only some seconds in a shop such as phon@@ ica to realize that record shops offers a relaxing community of equ@@ ities .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers ass@@ ump@@ ed to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel over@@ thrown by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of trusted sil@@ s , from objects that watch the lucky adult education .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or ownership of your property as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people so .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are as their social worker ! &quot; they killed one employee from one record stack .
in April , a survey of the IC@@ M revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record have not been heard of the last month .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player who never use them while 7 % of those who buy one plate , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I had a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , which works with sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men of middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone wasn &apos;t recently here clean and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ plate , so I would like to put them into shelf . &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it will definitely happen .
more product loads , less music sounds .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
that are younger people , not older that are only to pur@@ ify slowly .
fold , that has dedicated the sound of records almost a whole floor , has an under@@ lower audience as I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists , the photos make , teen@@ ager and women aged age .
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thes@@ es and sex@@ t@@ apped pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity in the customer .
none of them can be separated , but n@@ ag@@ ile psych@@ otic trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult , if one stands for someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in business for some minutes and considers the Vari@@ et@@ ows of the available records .
it has more a man@@ ne@@ a bum@@ ps as a big buy .
they don &apos;t deser@@ ve many , so is the collectors of records no real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; they drives with a soft sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the licence to number the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young te@@ ous girls who group@@ ed up for a moment to purchase Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classics that essential boards for an average collection .
nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for this item could mean more money for the industry , and some of the clients could send in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like records .
even though my research @-@ resear@@ ches revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v leave it , at least in business transactions in S@@ oh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and record holder who exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ ums .
these people work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the b@@ um@@ ber through plate shops of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while standing the star@@ ring of an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ian , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who rises not over the shoul@@ ders of middle ages .

French Court re@@ jects an offer for demol@@ ition of shops in the refugee camp in the refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live in the jung@@ le .
during a hearing this week , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should have jurisdiction in Cal@@ ais , to sell 72 temporary business operations in which people within the bearing can sell , hair@@ dresser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture are argu@@ ed that these places would be over@@ thrown , because they would be paid a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups distributed the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the order of people who operate the 72 temporary business , but I was thinking that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; is absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
the Judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role as a mere people live &quot; live in extreme conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the locations that was threatened by defe@@ ats was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is char@@ n@@ ered and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as an advice regarding demand for asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure &quot; for this child would be a disaster of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants rated on Friday that the number of people in the jung@@ le bodies increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number is now - according to a steep rise of new@@ com@@ ers during the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rein@@ car@@ bure@@ tor must be adjusted to the next generation speed worlds : in different Länder , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new lightning tools are tested to over@@ lead the tem@@ pos@@ ure especially effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , can be used for example of inci@@ dental points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway construction sites or to san@@ itation bridges , there are often no necessary infra@@ structures to ensure a stationary Bl@@ itzer to ensure the speed lim@@ iting .
a permanent mobile construction can be however dangerous or co@@ stly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is autonomous : its battery lasts five days and the cas@@ u@@ ction data will be transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously on multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed lim@@ ent@@ ations , as well as distances according to time , drive strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
for high @-@ driven state , one can move the tra@@ ilers according to the manufacturer by each car with a trailer hit@@ ch .
in this way , it is not simply th@@ aw@@ ed , it is lowered into a measuring mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ elled , and by the way it van@@ ish to van@@ ish outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested in different federal states and has now been used as well .

the most impressive performance of British accession to the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odo@@ oro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line running and ro@@ x power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of each color .
the defeat was caused by the un@@ poor tro@@ op price of silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on that same day could fall on them in the final .
but , regardless of these , Fi@@ ji had a 15 @-@ man crew in the form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind it .
eight years ago , she lost her game under Ry@@ an every game when Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
you lost only one here .
these sle@@ ek will be we@@ ary , but the progress is astonishing .
Fi@@ ji started mar@@ qu@@ ely and caused the attacks of GB@@ S from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co . on , one would run into running co@@ aches . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when the sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au returned to the corner .
with another four minutes of game play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB did hardly accept the ball .
a h@@ un@@ ted t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to attain a third goal but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a saw a touch down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and still existed over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou pre@@ f@@ eted by another weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still exists .
it is so too .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions for the first half time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was running after a ro@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the southern Consul@@ ate , whose fans che@@ eks , felt and dance on the fun@@ nel .
it was not difficult to see the play@@ able approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ cake with a further attempt in recent seconds .
the pup@@ il bl@@ ended , the Fi@@ j@@ is em@@ bra@@ ced and GB briefly defeated in the lawn .
in former days Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated 20 @-@ 5 in semi@@ finals and the Great Britain pushed South Africa in a close half final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the ground in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton went through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the positions in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the Train@@ ers as a rowing victory
there is no emotional gold than with this games and I want to be called .
from the very first r@@ ash to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the ones who sat at the resting place , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympic champion in a row without tax , the first women in the history of British Sports , which laid a scale of such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , all of you say 3@@ 9.@@ more un@@ conditional use , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of Schw@@ ules , which does not reflect the kind of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each gold in the Ru@@ ins , a batt@@ al@@ ion will contribute to content hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach , who would not survive this day ago , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , being operational and they did .
if you do not do that , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
fortunately , fortun@@ ate was fortun@@ ate that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could lead the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that in such circumstances it is the right concept .
I needed money , therefore it had to go back better soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
it starts so .
rowing at itself is already a challenge , but this makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ ability of the victory there went their first thoughts on Williams , who spend some more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the cent@@ ur@@ ion of the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week a emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means a lot . &quot;
it is just repeated that this means how much I and Helen and that Robin became involved .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no man , therefore a massive Dan@@ ke goes to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person to trainer or need a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to qu@@ eu@@ ed , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very well caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in trial . &quot;
it is really important to let not rip .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something bad .
we wanted to have no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result to go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take away for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear in a wedding next week , their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now it wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London there was about six months to realize that I &apos;m a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels like much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity &quot;
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ emeyer group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , will go into retirement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian capital . &quot;
a little fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
thus it was a period of some time in the origin@@ ator in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ ks with@@ drew the purposes .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ emeyer group called &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who has been working for 31 years , 28 years as managing director .
he was re@@ tire at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association with the seat in K@@ otten@@ dorf , Municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ schläger , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further towns and municipalities there are water suppliers .
the current chairman , Breit@@ ling &apos;s civil champion in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set as water in 1985 and became Managing Director of the association already in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work over office and organization activities , the budget production , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re@@ acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ building of a central computer control .
there was no breast@@ plate and I have added innovations again , because drinking water is more , and drinking water the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised the oil of oil , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has joined himself with much heart blood for his water @-@ purpose , and he has been working with the water @-@ purpose @-@ association , than if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he had to present the success concept of the v@@ eit@@ ful group in the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s part lob@@ b@@ é Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years with him .
he is the best water and he was a lo@@ yal bu@@ d .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from its point of view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the association .
the greatest challenge and the tough@@ est operation was the tu@@ ck of the floods at Kirch@@ schläger on January 3rd .
here it had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
once the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n you only have to be able to keep the flood of pe@@ ett@@ stadt with mud .

&quot; the man called for us and declared to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ess , &quot; said a police officer .
the perpet@@ rators be upon the run , after him I become publicly spot@@ ted .
now nationwide , since Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown and burned .

in the meantime the man carries a glasses .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon , such as the police .
whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship relationship . &quot;
the victims were born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lu@@ beck wanted to make no information about the ts@@ ather@@ period or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a man had been killed .

steel - light view for German steel industry
the risk of energet@@ ically and energet@@ ic German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burden , threatened by the industry from the eco @-@ world promotion , are from the table .
it stays in the liberation of the Renewable Energi@@ es in the inventory for the so @-@ called own power production in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really glad that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission therefore planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the high @-@ furnace for power generation , to ask the checkout .
according to the German industry sector , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , it is a certificate of principle with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators be replaced in the steel structures , an EEG monitoring of 20 percent should be replaced .
but these also shall not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the EU Commission to own power production .
this means that the status Quo was largely written down by the previous regulation .
special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our Campa@@ ign &quot; Stahl is the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions rights are climate and employment targets , &quot; said IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation wor@@ sens further , as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , faced with the weak@@ ening national demand of custom steel on the global market .
European manufacturers represent Chinese steel rop@@ es price cuts .
during this spring the situation has something relaxed .
to show a show@@ case , import duties on impor@@ ter effect , and others have brigh@@ tened economic prospects in China .
it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the pricing is .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was c@@ auti@@ ous in Thursday on Thursday .
last@@ ly , the prices are again stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to not exclu@@ de Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp in order to exclu@@ de fac@@ tions of individual works .
at the end of 2015 around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel producers remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced at 3.4 million tonnes , and six percent less cru@@ de steel than during the previous year as the German economic unification took place on Friday .
after a short increase in May the amount therefore returned to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association is calculated in the coming months thanks to improved order situation with increasing emissions .
community , spirit , health : singing senior citizens
the S@@ ingen has grown all their lives at her life : as young girls she was at the school choir , in the teaching position , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels like , che@@ er@@ ful and a total of alive , she says .
she is doing something good in her health and her spirit .
for singing is right from several perspectives a great hobby for Sen@@ iors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler , from the German Senior Partner League .
most of the seniors in choir and share the joy at the music , Hac@@ kler describes .
through regular interaction , seniors and contacts may link and maintain .
for often dis@@ sol@@ ving social and family structures in the age , an or@@ ch@@ orus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp did in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organ@@ ise themselves to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of mer@@ it . &quot;
sing can be positive in the positive sense , Hac@@ kler says .
for exercising becomes a deep and controlled breathing .
those who demands his lung regularly calls them , even in everyday life , not as fast as the d@@ ots .
even though it comes to sound the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Urs@@ ula L@@ enz by the Federal Community Community of senior citizens of senior citizens .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher pitch , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in the leisure time , declared it .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening of songs by elderly people we@@ aves many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through song lyrics and especially mel@@ ts themselves de@@ men@@ ded mankind to long rec@@ umbent events .
with singing , a special achievement is required by the head , L@@ enz will be explained .
at the same time to focus on their own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to other coun@@ sel@@ ors - this is a cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only exercise themselves on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition , which one goes through the singing in choir , Hac@@ kler claimed .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ feeling of self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is growing by singing in a choir .
himself to show yourself : if I am long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , there &apos;s enough .
everyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he comments , little talent , you will av@@ enge L@@ enz .
people are not singing alone - with 50 sing@@ led people , who list@@ ens when doing a sound next to it ?
looking for the appropriate offer , seniors have various possibilities , says Hac@@ kler .
one can simply join the acquain@@ t@@ ance of a senior chamber , one can simply connect himself .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the vicinity .
for those who want to sing in a cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical choir , you can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many seniors rounds can be found on the Internet .
if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors can ask help at the Internet .
anyone who has to sing , should be sure to connect to an choir of Hac@@ kler .
sing the soul good and has some evidence . this applies to any age .
cats respond more sensitive than k@@ itt@@ len@@ ess of ma@@ ids
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover , what effect the ru@@ dder of cat baby has grown to adult animals .
for their surprise , the les@@ hip were not cold , however , they kept not too cold , however , in the difference to the females .
female cats may recognize the root level of cat baby &apos;s gro@@ wers on the gro@@ ove of little ones .
they react to ten percent faster for k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens which found themselves in large distress , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
sk@@ aters also react to the k@@ itt@@ ens of K@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the h@@ oning of less and strongly ar@@ ous@@ ed young are not perc@@ ep@@ tible for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H said .
it is the first exploration of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ z Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens with the impact of their help is different .
a total of nine adult K@@ ater and eight K@@ ätz@@ old from the animal @-@ holding of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were played for a herd of little ones that were taken for three minutes from the saus@@ age box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were faced with noise of more intense k@@ itt@@ ens faced in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for sa@@ w@@ sa@@ c .
&quot; all the female , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ amer , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned faster to the speakers , if this ru@@ ff has been used for a very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be born or do with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male re@@ acted at all , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on babies .
there were also some studies that women have sensitive to infants re@@ acted , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky attacked with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued an arrest warrant against the incoming football star of Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
an important soccer game will take place after the coup attempt in Turkey for the first time .
in front of the Du@@ eling of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already in the hanging of the exceptional status after the overthrow in July , the government , which would not affect the daily life of normal citizens should not be affected .
the latter , however , does not apply to those who are suspected to tackle the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not made in front of the football .
at the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
the South America , which is currently living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is to be the supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted p@@ utsch of Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup attempt .
although it is valid for 90 days , the exceptional status is still valid until October , actually the most of the Turks like no impact on the life of the most Turks .
the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy rally &quot; on public places in the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for over .
the Sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and fo@@ amer .
especially fans of the workers club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not count among the friends of the president .
but what is the Turks , however , in view of dramatic experiences in history , strict re@@ jection of military p@@ utsch@@ es .
there even fans themselves - no matter whether their heart beats at Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
with poker winner &quot; Gala &quot; it will be coming to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski in particular .
its sporty value presented in Cologne in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 Victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the t@@ rophy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for record master found a reconc@@ il@@ able end .
after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the lions &quot; played early in the Europe League early .
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g there was only ranked 6th .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we did it and that is the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ sky said .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the playing year ran better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 seasonal figures as a South @-@ li@@ g tor@@ ch , the base was up to the 14th titles .
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in this way , the Gom@@ ez was announced at the AC Florence under the Treaty and announced at Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as only to the coup attempt on account of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must just say it , &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
however , the stor@@ ms would have to be willing to abst@@ ain from some one @-@ third of his to 7.5 million euros of an annual salary which is clear : &quot; its salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot;
D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals in Rio Olympics
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athlet@@ ics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio around medals .
d@@ oping the theme of D@@ oping was determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian flo@@ at in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had en@@ su@@ ed after a d@@ oping c@@ w , got rid of their start right in front of playing ( 100 meters of chest ) gn@@ ashing and hat@@ ched .
it was a sk@@ a@@ or@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a finished smile she was even holding into the hall with her performance .
as a permanent that they won &apos;t bring gold , the audience broke off in a storm tower .
but there are many more athletes , who continue to start at the Rio Olympics , despite d@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the field of athlet@@ ics .
he had already been closed for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his work , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two times world championship champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had severe dent@@ ures after surgery , def@@ ending 29 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European championships were tested positi@@ vely in 2010 to 2016 with meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ gest@@ ion and was locked in six months .
the four most likely lit@@ ters in this year are to the account of the big gold f@@ avo@@ red .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : Beijing Olympics Champion and two times World Champion over 400 m was fully tested and closed in 2010 .
a means to penis enlargement would have been responsible , imp@@ acted Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest men so far .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes were subsequently recognized as many medals .
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its world championship title for nine years later , after it was found with test@@ osterone d@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ oping and EM @-@ title in 2006 because of test@@ osterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a verdict of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked 3rd in the World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the World Champion and Gold@@ f@@ it@@ in was only positive in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world champion , not@@ ices were found on taking a banned food supplements that fell mil@@ dly in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA and ran out on July 13th .
bomb error in Thailand - Austrian woman hurt - additional dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , standing in contact with the woman , said spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ab , Friday , Friday .
she suffered by chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this place .
her return trip is scheduled for early September .
whether by further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe - Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arise concerning this regard in a permanent contact with local authorities , so b@@ oul@@ ders .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a chamber of two bombs .
according to the police , the police have killed in Thailand and about 20 people viol@@ ated , including the Austrian , three German , three states and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explo@@ si@@ ves went up again , and a further human being killed , according to the authorities .
even by Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb det@@ onation was reported in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation of the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police values .
Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , in the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , then another bomb explo@@ ded by a municipal company .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ si@@ ves had gone to the air before the Re@@ vier of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast of several injured .
one may go to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb leaves carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Car@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning prior to journalists .
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it was too early to exter@@ n@@ ally mot@@ ives for possible mot@@ ives - but it will take up the acts of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to know a pattern by the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ bers of mus@@ li@@ zed separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , explained the terrorist attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection or international terrorism .
&quot; this is just local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
it is rather pointed out that bombs were killed by bombs of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities had been confi@@ dential information in the south of the country during the past few days - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places .
it is still un@@ clear , which group is behind the attacks .
police proved their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement quarter .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bombs , but they usually do not judge tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years of Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the more recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able to aff@@ ord the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high level of safety ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as pre@@ ah Vi@@ ews and its surroundings .
according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to return these journeys to these provinces .
increased level of safety ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were carried out a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military j@@ unta .
this dre@@ amed the military influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta head and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs was an attempt to hal@@ ve chaos while the country is moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ aval , keeps himself down to have the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , it did not succeed in the military , which has been in the extreme south of the country , the insur@@ g@@ able insur@@ g@@ ents of the country in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok , during a stop on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ rein with 20 people have been killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
the rights of &quot; ident@@ ities movement &quot; has come into the visa of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection .
the constitutional provisions of the Group have also been protected under observation after several provinces .
&quot; we see at the &apos; ident@@ ities movement &apos; appeal points for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the liber@@ ally democratic principle , &quot; said Constitutional protection manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , the other Islamic faith or the Middle East will diff@@ use in extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we observe the movement again .
the &quot; ident@@ ities movement &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns on &quot; multi@@ cult &quot; multi @-@ cult , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity due to over@@ alien@@ ation . &quot;
the constitutional remains in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority have voted in favour with the state offices .
&quot; groups such as the &quot; ident@@ ities movement &apos; try to fet@@ ch their target audience , where she stands , &quot; said the Verfassungs@@ schutz .
generally , you are trying to address them with you@@ thful language , often with persistent music .
the acts of Islam@@ ists as well as legal trem@@ bling .
this is not an advertis@@ ment for their own thing .
the prop@@ aganda is supposed to be emotional .
young people are due in a special manner .
this is dangerous .
recently , it was given an account of several German states about contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; among other African politicians .
Ma@@ ate said that he did not in@@ sights .
the constitu@@ tional@@ ity of this species is relevant only from a certain point .
it comes to whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people , which are very extrem@@ ist , changes , and is becoming very extrem@@ ist .
that is decisive , whether such persons pushed the influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a look at the significant increase of illegal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak yet in this context still not in new ways of terrorism .
but in recent years we &apos;ve found that just@@ i@@ fies structures can be found .
it was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be quite possible that further rein@@ deer groups or small groups formed the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee attacks or attacks from other right @-@ right diseases .
but it is not recogni@@ z@@ able in a German @-@ wide or European control system .
the group had emerged in the regional level or social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many exc@@ essive attacks on the account of people who did not occur in the right scene in the right scene .
this is the al@@ ar@@ ful ar@@ ming .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences , who had nothing in the case with right papers , who perhaps voted polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for instance CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who then have radic@@ alised themselves through legitim@@ ate voting rights . &quot;

GfK and guided tours , dis@@ appointment after dis@@ appointment
the research @-@ research company GfK was kidn@@ apped by Matthias Hartmann .
the feedback came suddenly - but not surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company GfK had established that the Chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann , who will remain un@@ safe , ever made longer the success of his success .
tur@@ bul@@ ence on the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK : after re@@ dis@@ appo@@ inting business numbers and re@@ sign@@ ation of the company management , the global number five of the sector is before a new beginning .
by the end of the year , GfK and Chief Executive Board intends to leave the company at the end of the year .

Mr. Hartmann has been on the GfK @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring have not yet been seen after 5 years , &quot; said it .
in view of the last@@ ly GfK business numbers , each participant &apos;s parties will eventually become in@@ quiet .
&quot; if that would be the case when BMW was in the case , it would also be done so that it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

inci@@ dents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
in an accident of an agreement with 43 senior citizens and passengers on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district of Aur@@ i ) eight people had been injured .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the Bus@@ ses of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to show their information according to the opposite le@@ aster , partly on the road railway .
the bus was coming to the right from the street and slip into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the situation of the Bus@@ ses , the persons could not leave the bus either , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liberated its occup@@ ants .
six trucks and a ambul@@ ance came to the accident at the state road 2 .
the unforgettable travelers were brought from one liner bus back to the crow@@ ded area P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called for the truck drivers and the potential witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cubic meter will be from 1 October 2016 for the water san@@ itation facility Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare € 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euro ; for ad@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage treatment will then increase once again , when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
according to the relevant lim@@ ulation , the se@@ wage price will be at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that his hom@@ ologation was approved by the Parliament and Kul@@ mb@@ ach states that these se@@ wage plants have been running sub@@ covers .
the market was oblig@@ ated to power the facilities at its disposal , due to just@@ i@@ fi@@ able foundations .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from cat@@ ers , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ ens , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must pay deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as chairman of the board of Herbert Schmidt on the panel , a new calendar was necessary for waste water san@@ itation facility .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover@@ ages from the previous year issu@@ ing period are included .
in all three se@@ wage facilities , Schmidt thus established that there are relatively small establishments with a very low se@@ wage storm , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to its low distribution basis , for example , expend@@ itures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would result in effect .
Moreover , the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , during the past calendar period , all three plants will not last year due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for cat@@ ers , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt showed that mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the san@@ itation facility at Az@@ endorf .
in the P@@ ump@@ kin &apos;s event , the nearly 20 year @-@ old feed equipment had to be over@@ taken from the ground . after nearly 20 years of operation the first har@@ dening furnace was dischar@@ ged , the sl@@ ender fl@@ ud@@ ge ensures and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to maintain the water legal requirements .
Schmidt : &quot; during these extraordinary expend@@ itures , the required remedi@@ es and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies for electricity costs which were significantly below the present level at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone cottages made clear that at low se@@ wer@@ age in the three plants the expenditure for the operation and maintenance is full thr@@ ott@@ le . &quot;
in this case , Schmidt is the market leader of large entertainment cost over the se@@ wage plants in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain short , especially since the supply area of the se@@ wage treatment Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al can not be enlarged by these plants because it is a deficit facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ ons
snap@@ shot says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive against race .
with his filter tool , it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million everyday users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that sur@@ ge@@ es the sur@@ d .
you can turn to a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be made from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are in@@ tri@@ mature , mat@@ ernity tools that generate more than 30 million improved self @-@ intensity per day .
all mis@@ ses arrive to the public .
snap@@ shot filters have withdrawn in the past criticism that they were accused of having driven the app Black@@ face fo@@ ster or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week a number of filters found a filter , which gave them mud , wrong teeth and evap@@ or@@ ated che@@ eks , called some critics on a ra@@ cial car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ land . &quot;
they in@@ quired about whether these repe@@ ating contro@@ vers@@ ations had a bigger problem , that the company has a diversity of diversity .
the news and the ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday widespread , with reports from The Publ@@ ishers and motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat hur@@ ried that it had been de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered a exc@@ use : the filter was the homage to An@@ ime characters and not intended as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but the standing that the rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , remin@@ ded of the filters of viol@@ inist c@@ lich@@ és .
other refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose photos have widespread over the photos that the filter will viol@@ ate and have had been un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is hard to ar@@ gue with the comparison of a very contra@@ di@@ ous Asian carto@@ ons and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is non @-@ safe , but the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ lowing is moved into the extreme .
snap@@ shot is not the only company that this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate crosses .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ pl@@ ess and integration battle , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in terms of race various other opponents - could rather expect to expect Sen@@ si@@ vity .
when one of snap@@ shot fil@@ tering a picture is that it is much more difficult to remember that such things were un@@ noticed when it was in the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , did her Snap@@ chat account to delete others to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay of medium and in a telephone interview , she said that cash @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ ities reflects a lack of di@@ spar@@ ity at the entry practices in Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leaders and finished their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that the Chinese Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions , in which they &apos;re certain or feel safe to say about it . &quot;
others share their mind , an appeal that the Snap@@ shot has mostly left un@@ answered .
the company published no figures for the diversity of his employees and shows its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on sub@@ sist@@ ed population groups and on internal integration conditions .
Zh@@ u said its part that she will be closed in the Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military govern@@ ance IS@@ IS Secret information , represents Committee of Congress
Mil@@ anese citizens of the United States Central Command changed rest@@ oring information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria as it is allowed to have the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can Members of the Armed Forces , reported a great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Service , reported to change their evaluations in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News services , which were typically accepted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , reported regularly a position in order by the American efforts to combat terrorism , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited newspaper article .
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , firm .
the guide error in Cent@@ Com goes up to the top of the organisation .
the ten page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct notice to modify the government peaks under Obama , it shows how anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct the pressure from their pre @-@ laws to record an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; as of the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly positive than the facts of the facts .
for example , Cent@@ Com members publicly announced that a military retreat took place in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second biggest city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; after the months of investig@@ ations@@ &apos; , he is as much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , published in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leader of the Central Command has changed the declaration of conformity with IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans re@@ called the Task Force , after playing them , anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct concerns relating to the manip@@ ulation of reports to Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued .
in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are further investigation by the General Inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange .
the Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published its own in@@ sights on Thursday , coinci@@ de with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com presented an over@@ charged process for creating significant contributions in I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the t@@ allest democracy in the Com@@ ac committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , announced in an opinion .
this process , as Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; p@@ ou@@ ched the mor@@ als &apos; anal@@ ysts &apos; and delivered very little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ ps and the Democrat stated no remarks on a intervention of the White House in Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts as regards a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; on Tuesday .
last August , the New York Times of Invest@@ ments reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ torate , which were surveyed by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , announced in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspec@@ tor are still in action .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes imp@@ acted out opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ lied on the question of a successful air campaign under American guidance in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , rejected the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for consuming military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State remin@@ ders of Zwi@@ st@@ utes from more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a text on the question of many anal@@ ysts , saw only a small cre@@ eping force in Iraq and had little time pointing out on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ kers , according to the government agencies , states that contrary the statements of the government had no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provis@@ ionally refin@@ eries would have been put into operation at the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his revised positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Com@@ position Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States win fourth match in the hockey field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with great Britain before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match against India , that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 won .
five goals in two games should actually be able to represent a memor@@ able power but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember ever to have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition , and they are equally defeated in their group with the British in the first place , which after its 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
great Britain and the United States will meet again on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams are already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide to obtain the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take a little longer a little longer to the path that guide the other group .
as always the play may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprise host through their success story , four years after it landed on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey team in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a National Player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they didn &apos;t qualify for the ader .
then came the year 2012 , in which she left for her and her team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn the things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , an investment change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t had the work sp@@ ens@@ ing in London that we now have .
we can completely pl@@ uck the rest completely .
on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team showed sur@@ pris@@ ingly , and stayed at the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she carried out a spr@@ int with the sh@@ allow ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ ck@@ led the ball to the Americans for a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a goal in any of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good is the result of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro is constantly being resistant and ir@@ relevant , a race relay between competition and stre@@ ches .
it is , when the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod that will protect their s@@ wimm@@ ers to the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can not read the tel@@ ev@@ isions , a newspaper read or hearing during your neigh@@ bor in the waiting @-@ long at Coff@@ es@@ hop , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y , or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then it is yet Logan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a girl of women with dimples , could definitely be sent to Prime Time , where he would have been built to Prime Time , when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even F@@ om@@ b .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , was fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , some in the shade there are the sports that are not generally acknowledged : air springs , Arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have it long .
but if I really want to make arguments for my specific dar@@ ling , then leave the attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tr@@ amp jump have already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , the last 16 years suffered so much that many of them had asked , I didn &apos;t know that it was at all an Olympic Port .
that could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the United States had prepared for competition , it has never gained a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ini and had a athl@@ ete up until 2012 , who made it until the end of the round .
the Chinese and Rus@@ sians ten@@ ds to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the tr@@ amp jump has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ears of a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I ought to ad@@ mit that I am no expert , but only a faithful enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ously potential - the cart@@ oning trem@@ bling of its never to s@@ wollen out@@ pr@@ alls - but also the gra@@ zie of the turn@@ around and divers , which combines two sports that essentially combines it .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which is as much as &quot; dive board . &quot;
the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot at almost 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling moves ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ ogram according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ one athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes , and back , up and down to the playground .
they hunt only the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV broadcast another cave target : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the goal oriented Stre@@ ets is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ l value , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir up a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I myself thinking to look at this games as something un@@ wanted .
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ini is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or them pr@@ un@@ ed up , seem@@ ingly heavy he@@ ap like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , then go down , then down@@ wards again , then effortlessly back up .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ect@@ onic attack on the goal , no ra@@ vening in the distance , only the dre@@ um@@ eric , elegant end of time and gravity .
it is so Zen such as the competition on the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men are also on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the dr@@ au@@ ds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie they speak a quiet , nice moment , one who probably is over@@ thrown in general .
if the consciousness could only be reached by the attack@@ ing and the object of male athletes - as recently struck the male &apos;s Turner according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his way to air , new fans .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long one of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , hit the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that the protest@@ ing of the police were killed by polic@@ emen of the police .
where Ethiopia are gathered together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable African countries , a solid group of Western Europe with rapidly growing economy .
but during the last months of the protests against the government , protests against the government and spread themselves abroad .
last week , thousands of people caught up on the streets and the fundamental fundamental political changes .
the response to the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators killing and killed .
in circulation , videos on the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals sm@@ ite young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ over against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands an ongoing investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to join this country and in future it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
American military and intelligence services collabor@@ ate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , in order to combat terror over the region , particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa if ever , get so much western help .
C@@ ush economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ in in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia are all others as a role for democracy - human rights organisations have pro@@ gres@@ sed the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ sidents were effective immediately to silence .
many were sent into exile or imprisoned in exile or put them into the desert of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ians .
the entire youth were protest@@ ing .
a generation was protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from ground use up to the saus@@ ages in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a broad@@ ly critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time rises the ten@@ sions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for these jag@@ ged , controversial line required in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced over the past few years , could recover the tur@@ bul@@ ence and they could be armed with themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of def@@ ences after years of cr@@ um@@ ns now explo@@ de on the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : Smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian people were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what is done in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , conce@@ al where they keep up .
several young C@@ ush gave heed that they were so too protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ chi and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since the ae@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from branches of Ethiopia in Russia , in politics and economy , while they had explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in flat lands .
but this changes also changes .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen &quot; says Mul@@ at@@ u Be@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population , and which are dominant in the military , in secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ ad@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion led to his death on a non @-@ public disease in 2012 17 years , Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man that could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly le@@ ver@@ ed to perc@@ eive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to make ad@@ versaries , and to make them un@@ dam@@ aging .
&quot; the current regime is missing on this basic field , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis .
C@@ ush , new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected in relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
otherwise , Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Ethiop@@ ian Mountains in Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analysis reports that he can do not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fears that the result will be more ble@@ eding .
the last time in Ethiopia in 2005 , Ethiopia was trying to prot@@ ested thousands against elections which were done according to the analysis of Analy@@ tical and then stolen by the government .
while the following Raz@@ zi@@ en were killed , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this period of distur@@ ban@@ ces passed relatively quickly .
development experts pra@@ ising Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit , and for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty control .
but obviously , this does not have the inten@@ ving of the inter@@ iors of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it occupies a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month joined forces in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , by Tig@@ ray led stores and the hat@@ red against the tig@@ ray in the social media is always usual .
analy@@ tics say that protests in the USA and other Western allies have a distinct position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the adjacent Somalia , even if they recently divided that she closed this base .
while the West clearly intends to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to comp@@ ile his alliance in a already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ski hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama to have IS@@ IS was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , giving his campaign , that his repeatedly repeated claims , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist state of Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions concerning communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans whether it is able to communicate clearly and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings its fellow soldier , who ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain in the stock@@ ings which he could not have .
after he had made the adoption of a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the alleg@@ ations on Thursday and existed in interviews to indicate that he did not int@@ end to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning star , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he is simply s@@ ati@@ fied .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said to whom Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought to be entirely serious .
as the conservative radio present@@ er Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help something to destroy him , saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate could not know anything of it .
the last storm of criticism of Mr. Tr@@ ump came down , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of exp@@ ulsion of the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped spe@@ ech@@ es in Michigan at this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t would lead proposals to higher taxes and that he was bor@@ ing her speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m at his defense against it .
at the end of July he attracted strongly critic@@ isms than he meant the Rus@@ sians should have Mrs. Clin@@ t enam@@ ils , but he later explained &quot; Of course &quot; Of course . &quot;
this method allows to post@@ p@@ one Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic bound@@ aries in politics and then returned to ru@@ dern .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test , like certain messages received from his fans , as they come , and then if necessary , &quot; according to how the reaction is taken . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , an communication expert , which observed the language of both candidates .
but I think , too , he is smart enough to keep his statements , so that they can be interpreted in different way .
instead of the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump took one more corrosive sound , since its poll@@ ing values continued to decline .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he is accused of having assassin@@ ated his reviews or understand his testimonies .
but while he is reinforced with the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Pur@@ ze would have brought into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of what prov@@ ok@@ ant seems to have his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ c@@ ession , attracted major efforts to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was inter@@ viewed for the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps . Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , that he called her back@@ ben@@ der , completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans have to ar@@ gue that the government served as an Foreign Minister in which Mrs. Clinton had allowed IS@@ IS to spread out the situation in the Near East of aggressi@@ vely .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump carried out his attacks on the media and did to fight them on every his word and pre@@ occupied it against him .
he de@@ fied the poor , ch@@ un@@ u@@ chs , &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot tell it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , merely a further proof that he was not suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once pushed over the market from the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
ver@@ b Cafe was a shame café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay only cash , but this was no Wi @-@ Fi for 15 years of good coffee .
of course the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ face was pushed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , finished in the summer of 2014 , sells soap into the form of Cup@@ cakes .
loc@@ als considered the last loss in a contrary to the opposite city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ja wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still do not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is except , and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York Change is , then there is also new .
a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still fine .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for excav@@ ators bought the same Esp@@ res@@ Som@@ atic model .
it even uses the same lights from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wi@@ ches stand with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ches like cap@@ ers and s@@ alty onions .
there are natur@@ a fence .
the café offers no beer more , but there is fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a st@@ alled power of old native @-@ customers .
&quot; many old customers have also been displac@@ ed by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regular .
even after she had gone to Green@@ point , it would take the way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee table , told them .
&quot; it was clear that it was in the coffee and at the culture in the ver@@ b , which was right in my eyes , &quot; she said .
now they drinks coffee , even if it rested on that day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , an aperture ends of C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and faithful customer since the start of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went out there before work and ordered un@@ question@@ ably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day as a Swiss watch watch and they prepare for my Every@@ thing tree with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he doesn &apos;t finish Gro@@ ll , that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has to produce a special soap for fr@@ b with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the coffee as ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go to their quote , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez board that he talked to al@@ locate them soon , so that his new neigh@@ bors feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally want to fill and sell the cold str@@ ing@@ ed coffee in bottles .
there is a chance that the café is located on a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was born according to Joseph W@@ itt , and said that he was destroyed on the ground , and the café is closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the space of the local and the best coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pri@@ ming food of the economic crisis in &quot; a sufficient meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt welcomed his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
President Roosevelt , a F@@ ai@@ ble for a refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen , Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was somewhat modest : emb@@ ell@@ ished eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as snack a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the coming people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans that they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and there are both food @-@ hist@@ ori@@ ans .
Co@@ da &apos;s last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; was explained by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; on life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the Food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A @-@ lasting meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the great depression .
you showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , gra@@ cious snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive oil while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetables did eat .
when the re@@ porter opened min@@ ers , it found the pair for a discussion about the meal in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ der .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared of a ingredient and a slightly cheap , which ampli@@ fies ingredient .
imagine how many pe@@ an@@ uts eat that they serve them as a dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in a US budget , mainly in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women served for male field workers and it was served fresh b@@ aked past@@ el for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the US that they sent to hunger over the first world war to hunger . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the way to which the country went with it to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; it was a time when food to the Americans was a central , donated topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similarly , the new Bud@@ get@@ ed j@@ ing@@ es was the mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and cookies have been added to stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ t as &quot; wonderful kind , eating house , re@@ modeling , &quot; noted , as delic@@ ately hidden all ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheap drying .
meat , which was the heart of the American kitchen , became a rare luxury .
in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally ous mixtures were tried out , since a cal@@ ory and nutr@@ itious satisfaction of performance was given in the taste or even healthy kitchen .
while sear@@ ches for the book , that includes recipes , a court made of this ep@@ och , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit any other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping models .
as never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ary industries - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the hab@@ its of the country of the country .
in acc@@ using recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; budget host@@ esses , and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals , to be justified .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of the historical treat .
in particular , the reports about the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ meal @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he sp@@ ei@@ sts like the million strong man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a nearly gilded dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ tu@@ lip .
he was great real@@ ignment .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to st@@ ain an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected when the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , bricks , as well as science was applied to food .
the couple gave to the writing of the book to have understood the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example , as they could not throw any food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; they really made sick . &quot;
there was the winds of wind .

he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a bom@@ bed attack against the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group , which , according to the picture @-@ Zeitung , nearly 60,000 people have saved the lives .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour salvation of a child from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the luminous tool@@ bar in the Gra@@ ve of the war .

Greenland : the oldest ed@@ dy is nearly 400 years old
rarely sight .
Greenland is usually only available in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats up to the North Atlantic with just a 1 km / h .
Greenland did not get offspring with 150 years .
fe@@ eb@@ le the Greenland area at the bottom of the North Atlantic along the ground , it is just 1,@@ 220 metres away on average .
only when it comes up , the five metre long animal accelerates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a seal .
this of lon@@ el@@ iness of lon@@ ely lifestyle seems to be a god@@ father for a tall age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of Greenland , which could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ick from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this lif@@ esp@@ an that means a world record for cycl@@ ones .
although the evolution of evolution , the evolution biolog@@ ist believed that Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ils are supposed to be sil@@ ently .
only lack@@ ed evidence .
Greenland is hard to observe and eventually they live mainly in the iron ocean in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer to water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the winter only .
researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
their time @-@ up@@ emp@@ o measures them when they were in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard six animals with a transmitter .
for a prey , the bo@@ ot@@ y make this shar@@ k : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up the jaw of a young iron .
possibly , they hunt sle@@ eping animals or pat@@ rol in the reason of the ice cream and seek Kad@@ aver that finds from higher water layers to bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ils , Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ meter measured .
to determine the animals of the animals , they analyzed the lens of the Ha@@ ie with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens occurs in front of the birth of the shar@@ ks , which will not renew the proteins in it later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had much carbon @-@ 14 in lin@@ k@@ nu@@ cle@@ us .
their birth was therefore in the early 1960s , when atomic tests would try larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in which with 220 centimeters of length , the third @-@ smallest Tier included a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012 .
in its linear core , however , all major Greenland expedition had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ metre Greenland was showing an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k should be even 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females may only get offspring when they are longer than four metres , known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is well positioned on the threshold for the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ hair with the multip@@ lication was obviously at least one and a half centuries .
the world record should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the old record holder , a 211 year old Greenland , in whose sp@@ eck on the neck had a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organ@@ ism often survi@@ ves the living animals to au@@ ster@@ ity .
so they stri@@ ve ahead - and al@@ ps slow@@ ed down .
in order to keep warm water in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through which the animal grow .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with an eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a less@@ er beast that is more dangerous and should concentrate on it as soon as possible as many offspring as soon as possible , &quot; says the evolution of the evolution .
however , a very big animal should have to invest its resources in a long life .
building surface in double pack
with topics about the building , the church council has been concentrated in the youngest meeting .
in favour of relief , the board of Mayor Robert P@@ utz said that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported property cultivation can begin . &quot;
after expl@@ aining the property , par@@ cel@@ es and closing requests , the sale of land in the residential areas of road road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) are nothing more in the way .
the council is convinced that the short@@ com@@ ings in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and soci@@ able seniors are speaking equally .
as it was called , building consent will be available immediately in the City Hall , over the awarding of the plots is expected to be advised in its September session .
in order to make requests for the res@@ ett@@ lement of further industrial companies , together with the creation of jobs , the council decided to rev@@ ise the land plan created in the spring of this year in the spring of this year .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
consequently , the City of Frankfurt am Main has won the best chances to attract jobs and firms in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ x@@ ite vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate markets in the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money stores continue to operate from financial transactions within the whole EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport the approval in the UK has so far .
this just ut@@ ili@@ ze major US banks .

in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have become its head office , but it is less significant for the financial sector less than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the sheet is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ anders .
Luxembourg remains a large fund of the fund , cutting , but also just as Dublin &apos;s infrastructure .
Frankfurt am significantly easier to reach thanks to the large airport .

&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find out free @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder says .
on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate investments by 50 percent higher than am Main .
furthermore , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the consulting firm Mer@@ cer sets the city on place seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin at No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; as is the I@@ W .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrat and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ics reaches USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes primarily to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in spe@@ ech@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister had given an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ines from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns to the last ten years .
they paid a effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in regards to financial transparency , &quot; she gave Clin@@ t Kamp@@ a hel@@ per in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind wrong ex@@ pressing and re@@ trac@@ ing in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common to publish its tax data for US presidential candidate , although it is not oblig@@ ated by law for the US presidential candidate .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business man , and his lawyers have given a tax test carried out by the tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al .
&quot; they &apos;re on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of Democracy .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advis@@ ors , CN@@ N said that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already deser@@ ted that his ref@@ us@@ al issues related to wealth , his donations for charity organizations , its business bands and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton had already rel@@ ayed on the topic and released a video on the Internet in the high @-@ level rep@@ ublic@@ ans to publish its tax return .
on Thursday , on Thursday she spoke the theme during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish its tax returns . &quot; he said to the lot .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO claims that Tr@@ ump has paid no less tax during the 1990s for two years , and a economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of ac@@ count@@ ants and tax advis@@ ers , aware that it might be still the case .
Federal ste@@ es are become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and invest@@ or War@@ ren , which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million to a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , the buffet gl@@ omer@@ ate , whose seat has given its seat , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
Buff@@ ets said that he has also been subjected to a tax testing of the IRS and Tr@@ ump I have &quot; fear &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ ics Campa@@ ign submitted a tax return to the year 2007 .

the tax return of the year 2015 showed that it was only USD 100 of her income as a wage , unlike most of the Americans .

the method has proved effective as effectively and the Honey@@ guide Foundation already carried out the idea ahead with the US nature conservation , trained to use volunteers in the north of Tanzania , a non@@ violent four @-@ step method for protecting their homes and harvest without having to viol@@ ate animals .
before , many speakers used to defend itself .
Friday is the telephone day dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit we have developed an amendment to their setting , whereby it is much more visible that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields , &quot; expressed the managing director of Honey@@ comb Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ants of eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and bub@@ bles in a horn .
if he is not sh@@ av@@ ed down , a so called &quot; Ch@@ ili@@ ze &quot; is thrown .
the pu@@ ree with the earth is packed together with a fire@@ work in a con@@ dom , whose end has to be turned over to the ignition coil .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom with a pop up and spra@@ yed fine dust on the air in the air .

Jewish director strikes the Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation &quot; - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ cover a media uprising , after which he had betrayed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , there was no Israeli pre@@ fix since it requested to have requested Arabian guests as per employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ ist documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger in the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , having an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay lance holder Israel tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s international selection list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries listed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and cleared ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers one way to chose Israel through its own call center .
after a explanation , the director turned to the hotel .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel told that the measure has become a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
the reason , which was behind him , dis@@ band@@ ed more rage in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demands that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , the staff of Lanz@@ mann has been cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Commerce called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reported the South German newspaper .
we were astonished and dis@@ ma@@ stered by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this in Germany has happened in precisely this hotel chain , is even a greater shame even .
no explanation requires that .
we expect that the Hotel has drawn the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister .
the incident revealed a quite large reson@@ ance on the internet , with which the people got a sc@@ and@@ al .
some people submitted to the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it would have had the alleged experience of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly denied all accus@@ ations from himself and called &quot; the incident &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ated &quot; at lance holder , Der Spiegel reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to accept Israel in the German newspaper &quot; spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;

police viol@@ ates Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ st@@ ine to protest the Brazilian student
students placed on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reform of the government for the public image system .
police laid down Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ st@@ ine against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disp@@ oss@@ ess students , which led to the police , rubber mig@@ rat@@ ory and lac@@ ri@@ ves .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their asp@@ ir@@ ation about plans .
according to the proposals submitted by the Council of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rising to 71 % - RT business
with the repe@@ al of the sanctions against the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in the country grew strongly in the country , shared with the amb@@ ass@@ adors .
Russian enterprises take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to have access to the market .
of course , another trading company is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran declined by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports went up by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade change was achieved by deliveries of machines , vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan dates from a record @-@ breaking number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representatives represented approximately 35.000 Vis@@ as , primarily on the Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affect the number of tourists in Russia .
it could say that the record @-@ breaking tourists in Russia broke out in Russia last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , there are relatively few Rus@@ sians to Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in a good state , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite Gold was running for cycling
in the last night , Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night was a glory of fame when the British team def@@ ending the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor part that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made itself to E@@ at . he turned into a legend , as he stor@@ med home , to rescue a victory from the favorites of New Zealand .
England had a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ medals .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the railway world championships in London , despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did it in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried k@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they remained , when they saw the potential in the fle@@ ets , which now has un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the winner four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner sat down a Olympi@@ ar@@ ord , but in the qualifying rounds , the New Zealand prevailed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
hin@@ der was just back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and the Sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a large part of transformation from the out@@ comes in a higher gear to slow it and to enable it to keep it and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert from her position , Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y , and Hin@@ des , when he had climbed to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and to make a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ord in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was hin@@ ts that he fell down after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; It feels like the whole of the GB flagship to the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we are so bad in so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that had won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ ys it is possible to repeat the Ho@@ ys Victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a apparently most holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) were born - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese is equal to Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
man can win it with his colleagues .
it feels quite lon@@ ely to win alone .
he said , &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dy W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ner Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in the four @-@ time four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 to the target .
the World Record , who won gold in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest at the W@@ ig@@ gins , which will focus on safety .
he was disp@@ uted yesterday with reference to the qualification when officials called him to measure his height .
in the same period of women &apos;s competition that will continue to be continued tomorrow , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team will rely on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a s@@ ar at medals .
after a truly outstanding representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
in the background it &apos;s playing in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April middle of sex@@ ism and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ s and retired from sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if one sees itself the first evening of the Competition in Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite soon as it could be the legendary GB@@ S that has reached its cli@@ max at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland due to the abol@@ ition of the energy order
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts of Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply treaty and thus divided all supply agreements such as the supplier &apos;s energy company .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a payout for over 20 years will run in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs direct and indirect - could be end@@ anger@@ ed at a closure .
Moreover , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , as the melting of around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consumes .
in 2014 Al@@ coa saw the Point Henry melt , which led the last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ k@@ eth a lock .
this step follows the year @-@ long spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and finally due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , the large aluminum wind@@ ch@@ ment with his engine Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , has told that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina . the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares are held .
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means an additional physical demand for electricity through the melting , &quot; divided the company with .
AG@@ L also said that the contracts are called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; that would come into force in November 2016 .
the contracts concluded a 12 month period of notice , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts for the 2013 fiscal year will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the power supply .
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by forecasts of strong appoint@@ ments for large retail prices .
AG@@ L has announced that the value of the contracts already written in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to reserve the tre@@ aties to operate the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... to ensure the power to ensure the power to ensure the melting of the melting . &quot;
the U.S. company told that in 2010 it had completed a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force in November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has re@@ signed by the Treaty .
in this regard to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closing of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland ums around 600 megawatts and Tom@@ ago about 900 megawatts of electricity consume electricity .
if both plants van@@ ish into the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ ogue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the artist and mother of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sept@@ th edition of the US V@@ ogue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and running at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on its Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room full of people that I love , the appearance of this co@@ verse was crying , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ) ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn as well as in the presence of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic conclusion : they all have a surprise party .
this is the cl@@ ee@@ ee@@ zed action close to every birthday issued by a Children programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest did the set , &quot; You were forgot to have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this Public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of the V@@ ogue , the new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with safety .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the V@@ ogue cover is appro@@ ached ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most popular edition of the year .
with a gir@@ th that resem@@ bles a picture of a fashion magazine than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing 615 on advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected that in the last two years images of the magazine appeared before the official announcement of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in the past few years more &quot; celebr@@ ities , &quot; Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was born in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at low chances that Mr@@ s J@@ en@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; flow @-@ break &quot; of their generation - is under the previous category , is located in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related with famous people , or reality stars or young people from today who know how to do a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything appears upon J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are able to draw in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last Cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success each .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was still cl@@ amped in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Legacy Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d called &quot; the mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled up again than the news came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but to deal with the mis@@ ut it seems to be wor@@ ried at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is based on the cover of the September 2014 edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a superb model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your layout of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
and all of her sisters sell you pictures from themselves to their respective Pay@@ pal apps .
she sold the photos from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the journal LO@@ VE .
and in her free time it is visible in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal Centers Centers handle 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s members of the country are denied annually by the municipal centres , while the sector turned on the impact of further medium @-@ sized transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older persons , immig@@ rants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for od@@ d Del@@ og@@ ations and those who are interested in free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services of the congregation , who are already over@@ l@@ ent , are preparing for more cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal states .
the Director of the Joint @-@ Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipality Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had already rejected thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that situation without a repe@@ al of the decision of the Federal Government would only be worse yet .
Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal facilities are chron@@ ically signed , which means thousands of people of major services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who are violent relationships are leaving , people with un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able and impressive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers , the od@@ our , and these survey shows that they do not get the help you need them .
the Federal Government will be shortened by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of aid people from Que@@ ens@@ land are forced to be forced to inter@@ act with legal problems without any help .
we request the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice and the Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to store these medieval ab@@ brevi@@ ations , so that people may need help to maintain legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to lift funds on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community facilities and its customers , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey on countries @-@ elections : SPD and the CDU lose
in the elections held in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the ruling party SPD and the CDU .
this resulted in a representative survey of IN@@ SA &apos;s opinion research institute for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government g@@ alley could continue to rain in the north , this could not be possible according to the surveys in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would have the strongest party , and would have had good chances to continue the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD acc@@ ru@@ ed from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent over five years .
according to the survey , the party was only close to the CDU that could rise again to 23 per cent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the Left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite a slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8,7 % ) , the Gre@@ ens will return to the Schwerin Parliament in spite of slight losses .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented with 3 percent in the country .
according to the Congress of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD exports account for only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they l@@ wing this still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for return , the pir@@ ates would miss contrary to 2011 , in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator has arrived on the market 20 years ago .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a half , and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite t@@ apped .
the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight Meg@@ abytes , which would now be sufficient for approximately two sel@@ ections with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was launched exactly 20 years ago on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for some Euro lovers can buy the tools in the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age online .
but 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator has been a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hannover as a &quot; office in West @-@ pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible with HTML browsers , if also very slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was like to be opened like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found .
the price was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of an smartphones in Germany was € 392 .
no one could happen in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented re@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wrapped .
the market today will rule the vend@@ ors , which arrived much later than Nokia .
always everywhere , that is online today for very many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold : about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple were alone 555 million pieces .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ going businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ations company will come to this end .
all industries have now been created around the Smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough into mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac world the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and a Internet communication to operate everything per touch screen .
the winner train of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product in the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a neigh@@ bor .
finally , she w@@ asted to fight Black@@ berry .
the S@@ ages now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
on average , each German has today has 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we have to learn all to push the smartphone even sometimes , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel .
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England has to bro@@ aden the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only living in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , that was the biggest attraction in He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we had to make a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be back , by making new opportunities for the local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local municipalities we will provide 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that they will think that the challenge of enlargement of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I told me that England never will be ready for games and that we will be acting on the world stage .
the two sub@@ cut@@ ters in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
an option is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in tran@@ scen@@ ic growth and have a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion most expensive infrastructure programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , that was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two frequ@@ ented run cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third running ste@@ er , which is supported by £ 16 billion at private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row as well as with our future trading and create a mer@@ it of skills and employment , to be proud of England .

Ad@@ d@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ oleum &quot; regarding display
for companies that make money in online money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid ad block@@ ing , a &quot; stick and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that there would block displays on his desktop page , Ad@@ just Plus reported a blo@@ g@@ post in which it could update their filters in the program to block advertisement in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that his desktop page would change the coding in due to its advertis@@ ements to recognize it ad temp@@ ts the detection of what part of the page advertising is to be difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ just announced that it has found a new way to get new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the w@@ inter@@ ed open source community and the conver@@ ge has already been in action since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in the track &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media is left in the fight , is a powerful Indian , as a wor@@ r@@ ying indicating indicator of the industry .
according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , there are around 200 million people of advertising ; almost four times as much as of 2013 .
with 1.0@@ 3 billion every day , active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , makes handic@@ y@@ ag@@ gl@@ and 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company has no effect on display recor@@ ders on desktop computers , because mobile advertising recor@@ ders have no effect on Fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , distributed a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PC makes a sufficient high proportion of income , so that Facebook will be the investment of such a reasonable than worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that it would update his &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to make people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook demonstrated that Ad@@ blo@@ c &apos;s new filters would be ar@@ ous@@ ed because they would also block contents on the page that no advertising are not advertising .
&quot; for the user , we have no positive experience , therefore we are planning to arrange the problem , the spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail address .
display recor@@ ders are a bl@@ unt mean , why we are concentr@@ ating on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to lay more control into the hands of people .
woman being suspected of suicide on Swiss fre@@ eway
the sacrifice was right at the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday at a suspected self @-@ suicide of several vehicles were transferred on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
one woman in the Dark &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were met by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss lady at the age of 49 , that of several vehicles , including a load , was transferred to kill himself .
she died yet on the spot .
several drivers were already taken , but some are not yet identified , the police , who , as well as every voucher of the advance , have been reported to report .
an investig@@ ative proceedings were opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter in the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if any of the driver is displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Court st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the past five years show that the driver will not be drawn to the responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark at the fre@@ eway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t need to go out that a pedestrian crossing at the highway running on the highway like it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ rit@@ er was acquitted of neg@@ ligent murder , after leaving a man and killed , who was in August 2014 a night on the A1 close to Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and became un@@ conscious on the streets , the court committed .
the Court asser@@ ted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to a emergency call -- pointed out on a justified manner that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfect extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation . &quot; said the judges .
anyone looking for more information about the incident on Thursday , near Morges , should report on the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA chin @-@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble them of climate control .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dens@@ ities could once have experienced similar conditions .
scientists previously pointed out that the slow movement of Venus could be declared throughout their density .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , d@@ war@@ like atmosphere could have continued slowly .
the model lit up the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet presumably pointed out more dry places than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow movement of Venus reg@@ ained their daily page of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release .

Patrick Roy comes back as coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che Trainer
Patrick Roy coming on Thursday as a train@@ ee and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado , leading to the team &apos;s decision @-@ making decision of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek after a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have set my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I thought so much about it , as I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of Trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a member of the decisions that influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not met .
Sak@@ ic who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , he was interested in his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision : &quot; he said Z@@ acc@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him for the future only the best .
during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 during his debut season , the winner of the Jack Adams Awards recogni@@ zes the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado , in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota , he was defeated in the first round of the play@@ offs for every last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches reported a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the Wild for a second game card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two Pi@@ eces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ oil workers again accept@@ ing talks on strike strike
the workers &quot; strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers are exposed , while all dispute parties were set for a new round of talks on the table , the negoti@@ ators said .
strike against the Wood &apos;s oil provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we have agreed with the dis@@ closure process of the current battle , &quot; is stated in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the next weeks that will start the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the issues .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has reduced the inst@@ al@@ ments to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advis@@ ability follows a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company have required space to come through the market ab@@ up@@ swing .
as a result of thousands of people , Shell has released and plans for his part of thousands of people , putting his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , since it rati@@ onal@@ ized its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ ia @-@ but@@ tery with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to lower gross oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that had step@@ ping up by the British decision in June , the European Union .
in early this week , the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leader in order to discuss one of the greatest war crimes which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy , which works for many , not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Universal refle@@ cting teles@@ cope has helped you to collect the complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates under the star of the star Wars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in star cluster as well as in which related to the formation of the formation of the planet .
&quot; we hope that we know through the same of our results with other star clusters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years from the ground .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they now turn to the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these attack@@ ing stars pun@@ ches great amounts of stars .
since the winds of the stars are travelling , they have a slow down effect on the stars .
when a star alter@@ t , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ z@@ able steril@@ isation -- such as sun@@ shine -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates shows that more massive stars are slower than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower and wander@@ ers than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors see to be massive , as well as faster rot@@ ors appro@@ v@@ ise to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us that we would like to know more about how , when , and why stars are s@@ lows down their rot@@ ors and so to hang their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and its colleagues in three newspaper reports in detail on their latest analysis of the loading rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will be published soon in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs
the tears run at Alex Rodri@@ guez via the US Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of Base Base .
after his emotional re@@ sign@@ ation , the 41 year old pro will take place on August 12 against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the trio of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to both the , declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times was voted to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the conflict on 31 December 2017 , he served as consultants and youth coach - at full content .
as a player paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Nav@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas ran@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of Fame of Fame of Fame and Willi@@ e M@@ ays there are only two bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar to their values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old was not included in the silence of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - top name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversial is its appearance outside the square .
in 2009 , the super@@ star was issued at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , ster@@ oids have been banned .
in August 2013 , he was locked to 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main strug@@ gling for years to have an anti @-@ aging hospital in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favour for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez then said .
his f@@ are@@ well days are not dis@@ appo@@ inting .
while many Bas@@ eball Legends will once again receive the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job contains the attempt to win each game , &quot; Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ e@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first D@@ oping cases
caught : for a positive D@@ op@@ lane , the Wei@@ gh@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski in Poland will not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owing from the first official d@@ oping down .
a medal was won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official d@@ oping events became known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese flo@@ ats in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight @-@ weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ in@@ ski were tested positi@@ vely in Brazil - immediately before the start of the impedance of critical track events such as these messages .
in the past Sunday , Chen was diagnosed with the di@@ ure@@ um hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de which was used as a m@@ ask@@ an agent for roofs .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place finish in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , but only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen had previously expected to participate in the fore@@ head over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen has requested the opening of the B Trial Committee and a preliminary hearing in the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands Chen full Cooperation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; we will work together with the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CA@@ S and will accept the decision . &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the auction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio receiving the message with the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ e@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive itself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible lap , &quot; said it to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be supplements &quot; stated the Track of Track .
according to the report , it is supposed to act with the forbidden substance to issue blood d@@ oping c@@ EP@@ O .
Dan@@ e@@ owa was suspended in a provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should be quite positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow becomes voc@@ al with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men pull not the correct battles , &quot; said : &quot; we have been under observation , as many as have been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ loads cannot participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had been positi@@ vely tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both contest the in@@ gest@@ ion , however , not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
prior to the launch of the athl@@ ete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is one more serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the whole Russian crew to an exception because of systematic dos@@ ings , the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces many bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming pool , the earlier ver@@ tices in China was also fought between the athletes .
the Fr@@ ench@@ man C@@ amille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium for 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to surrender myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio .
Sun stood in the heart of a con@@ front@@ ation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping control , &quot; said this .
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese championships positive at the stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ acker her rans@@ om
the program@@ mers of replacement parts are currently targeted to target companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware infection specialists Mal@@ war@@ der ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have at least once again , partially repeatedly victims of a attack with compres@@ sors software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already using a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware ination .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly to take advantage of the perpet@@ rators , to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their Er@@ press@@ er Software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes . attacks on Att@@ acks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for high @-@ resolution del@@ ity is significantly higher than in case of private use .
&quot; we currently observe a terri@@ fying fast evolution of damage software , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ iev@@ cy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only private users were the goal , but the switch to the company &apos;s work carried out quickly in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an ox , they seek for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ Press , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files are encoded with the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the press@@ er .
to obtain the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ se mal@@ nutrition .
but where at private use , the personal photo database is available on the game , it is for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is closed .
accordingly , the damage is higher when an Ev@@ ans@@ om@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent , even the business activities had to completely break down , in case of a case of people in Fat@@ al .
in Germany , multiple hospitals already were threatened by Att@@ acks whose patients can be threatened by loss of sick@@ ness .
&quot; we always say the victims : pay out , you only promotes the problem , &quot; says K@@ y@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 per cent of companies pay to pay back their data .
for managers it is difficult to re@@ ject the support of the perpet@@ rators in the operation .
the chi@@ pper again know this and try to set up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the payload areas and contact with the cre@@ ws and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to constru@@ ct a kind of customer service to take more money .
you declare their victims per chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and will private people be saved after payments from a few hundred euros , companies must pay partly hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly .
given the potential high and relatively risk winn@@ ings from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware applic@@ tion , the chi@@ pper are always professional and share the work , explains security professionals Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write an R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programmer sell their cont@@ amin@@ ant software then in the form of a software building box to the actual compres@@ sors .
the existing malware kits were created by using malware self , consulting and additional tools for one @-@ time fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the press@@ ers then look for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the for@@ ums in the substr@@ ate , buying the set of a crime and com@@ missions another to install the software on as possible many PCs as possible .
payment is made per in@@ ferred calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , crime nov@@ els apply with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ewski explains .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that guarantee their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies @-@ IT managers in the Mal@@ warning News Survey will trust in R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and sc@@ anners software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators now follow new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient thre@@ ats for successful Er@@ p@@ ess@@ ness , the perpet@@ rators instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ ill@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the potential potential for damage , depending on the type of data , more times higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators now also could easily take new targets on the Internet of things .
at the chi@@ pper Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security for@@ scher , such as they could get a connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the heater to block a der@@ ive heating could be worth a rans@@ om for a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then use a whole production road instead of the heating in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be subject to an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and non @-@ tag@@ onal
in the small HR @-@ V Honda leaves everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty exc@@ essive , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz has actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V only works very small , the passengers have much space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely .
the materials of the interior are well processed and are comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top falls below .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage room .
there is not just a trunk space of 453 l at high resolution and 10@@ 26 l with re@@ worked back keys , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that is less magical , as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be high @-@ fold and offer the storage space , which is high up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk protection can be loaded well , however , the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to make his work a bit qui@@ eter .
the versatile consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km .
another engine is another engine : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering de@@ fle@@ ction should be somewhat direct .
the design included in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; has no wishes to be desired .
among the safety systems , the City Not@@ brake system ( runs until the tune of 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and trace assistant .
the coll@@ ision avoid@@ ance sometimes , because he has been rated as &quot; her@@ al@@ arms objects &quot; when maneu@@ ver@@ ing many obstacles .
the remote assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed regulator re@@ acts on traffic sign recognition and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t when needed .
but the most powerful connectivity is available only for the top quality : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB and one HDMI connector are connected under the arm@@ rest and therefore can easily be reached .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine receives from 20,000 euros in the diesel of 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda has a versatile and everyday use car .
Air@@ line not liable : down@@ wards to air@@ lift bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger plane on the air@@ lift bridge .
for a liability be conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able only by d@@ angers , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up with the crash .
but the accident would have never happen everywhere - it is a common life of age , so the judgment .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
disease of disease : when paid the promot@@ er
after their journey , after their journey , only money back when the cause of the disease is und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of visitors share the same symptoms .
on the negoti@@ ated case , a family was heavily affected by the tur@@ qu@@ ake on the second day of its tur@@ qu@@ oise im@@ min@@ ate and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ists to a def@@ ective cl@@ ash , which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that it was man@@ ned and def@@ endants with the organis@@ er .
before court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
even def@@ ective , the def@@ ective situation was def@@ ective .
but the organis@@ ers took only shortly before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment .
especially in samples of water no contamination were found .
a disease of several hotel guests - maybe in case of infection with each other - belonging to the general risk of life .
out of 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 people .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have wor@@ ried about the attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and decided to react to terror@@ ists at the same time .
sure : our country will not answer with hat@@ red and spl@@ ashing .
we don &apos;t know this triumph .
if perpet@@ rators have to leave the country much faster , the height of the population and force is also the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced a further personnel strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ digit size over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism allowed again under punishment .
video surveillance needs to be improved , the ar@@ senal of arms so appe@@ aled that the purchase of weapons is worth on the Internet .
the most recently discus@@ sion@@ ed silence for doctors will remain acc@@ ust@@ omed to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the medical shaft to seek solutions how the haz@@ ard of citizens could be reduced , he said to look at psych@@ ic suspic@@ ious transactions .
in order to meet a radi@@ cal@@ ization of refugees , the minister holds better social care for necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned investig@@ ator .
by the SPD leader , the SPD leader said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to increase safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior advoc@@ ates clearly against action .
&quot; this was a band for the hin@@ ge in the CDU / CS@@ U &apos; , Gabriel told the newspapers of the medi@@ al media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ition of double citizenship .
it is a general prohibition of fully cont@@ enti@@ ous agents for constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you cannot forbid that which one re@@ jects , and I will rest the wearing of the bur@@ ka .

better traffic flow on the fre@@ eway
it st@@ ole regularly on the run@@ way - here a picture from November .
however , this should change : the legal bi@@ esp@@ esp@@ ur should be extended .
that is good news for all car drivers who stand in the trade show every evening in St@@ au when it comes across the highway A@@ zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road of road construction extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler road by 700 metres .
drive in front of the hammer road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic sub@@ divided early , thus improving the general course of course in the multiple section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the drive close at the Zu@@ br@@ inger su@@ cks the drivers most from 17 to 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back au reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ped path and sometimes also beyond that .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fers at the B 51 shortly before the W@@ eler road .
from here , traffic can only be accessed via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ build in front of well @-@ thirteen years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required lifting capacity , especially to record heavy duty .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated stress has passed continuously , the state of the country cannot say .
however , at the time of years , for the bridge , the bridge has an official duration of up to 20@@ 34 .
for extension of the det@@ ach@@ esp@@ esp@@ ur the state @-@ operation has looked for the school holidays in the school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site on Wednesday .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
the International Class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a musical project now .
the N@@ IMA &apos;s association allows adolescents with migration and refugee centres to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy of Münster , Germany .
in the context of the association N@@ IMA &apos;s initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the occup@@ ations of the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association has been providing the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee camps to the objective of Germany to visit schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the students in the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German .

relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , you wal@@ lowing for ever , at night , you reach the wake in the morning , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ up so@@ unding .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , these problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep distur@@ b@@ ance and over ten percent feel common to sleep often or permanently .
how do sleeping trou@@ bles or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep problems , and there are many different causes that are based on them emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , a member of the German Society for Pain and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what you understand , however , the In@@ som@@ nie , therefore , an input and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ir@@ ish , is a member of the German home medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep problems ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
in the inter alia , organic , psychological , non @-@ related factors , but also medic@@ ations are plug@@ ged .
not rare is the sleeping expression of a different disease .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is especially important in depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it may be that various factors are prefer@@ able .
those who have her@@ ni@@ ated a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , wake all the two to three hours and begins to gre@@ et on everyday problems , and there is an example , We@@ e@@ ß is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when to do with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
who should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and will be imp@@ aired on the day , should go to the physician , av@@ eng@@ ed We@@ e@@ ß .
the impair@@ ment can look different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , tired , has trouble with the attention and the concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has voices fluctu@@ ations or physical aff@@ ord such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to dis@@ rupt the sleep , it is important to find out their causes .
behavi@@ oral treatment options include a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral treatment or also medic@@ ations - classic sleeping tablet only in exceptional cases and maximum for two weeks - in@@ question .
in Germany , the dormitories are hardly emphas@@ ised in Germany , emphas@@ ised Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , at bed@@ time , one should contact with sleep problems at the in@@ dent@@ ist , av@@ eng@@ ed We@@ e@@ ß .
the problem can clari@@ fy if the problems have an physical cause .
who should be going to sleep , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleeping laboratory physician , for example with respir@@ atory fail@@ ures , in case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ bility , in sleep errors or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a di@@ as@@ ive disorder ,
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not sleep lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ fty .
after stu@@ ff@@ ing , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes , one nose p@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a spra@@ ler on fingers .
a camera also shows a camera on the ceiling .
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pitches on which one can put for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and rise up , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep , watching television to sleep , alcohol and at night not at the clock - then we begin to look at once and that &apos;s all and not eligible .
what is the jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold a dis@@ appo@@ inting removal of DS@@ V teams at Olympus .
in December 2014 he took gold at the shor@@ tw@@ ave World Championships in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected from the ex @-@ team mate via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion will win £ 20,000 € and a jung@@ le of 150,000 € should never wonder about lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page .
the feed system in the swimming port is bad , but the d@@ oping control is very good .
we can not compete with countries that promote very much , and do not even run on the topic of d@@ oping or even run it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that all checks should be stopped here , &quot; he explained .
he wanted to start a com@@ eback after nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency , Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
just way you should keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de of Lug@@ di@@ eben arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Düsseldorf Airport
civilian population of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the capture of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects were committed as a ban@@ kers and baggage di@@ ets .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil civil servants recognised a band at the airport in Düsseldorf , which was known to polic@@ emen from the past theft .
the two women and two men had committed numerous Del@@ ic@@ te in mid @-@ July this year , and were highly professional and highly professional .
the specialists of crimin@@ al@@ Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can interpre@@ t the di@@ vor@@ s that were in@@ fer@@ ior to Germany by criminal off@@ ences in Germany , four acts .
they had carried a total of more than 15,000 Euro .
Alt@@ lor@@ ds , a few lin@@ king pools , in between still another head stone p@@ ains : the Rig@@ a@@ er Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works at first sight , but the police counts them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east from east to west , you arrive at playing places , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a grey house he has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished shortly before : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , is illustrated in the last weeks however pre@@ fers with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents were rented , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
in particular , since the beginning of the year , the police of Berlin had several times a tough approach to the project , the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , arrested three weeks , according to official statements for three weeks before the site , locked parts of the street and kept visitors from it , the house with the number 94 entered .
meanwhile , renovated building workers in order to open the un@@ familiar house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
in this summer afternoon , the road turns peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others have talked about Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects , there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left Viol@@ ence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has gener@@ alized three children , are mostly from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they share the care before increasing ten@@ ants and gent@@ len@@ tic@@ ulation .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; who w@@ ished the majority of polishing protection from v@@ and@@ al@@ izing the left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior cub@@ ator and the police open between house@@ keeping and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional labour @-@ quarter , which also resulted in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high risk of poverty .
offices and the nati@@ ves were too long for the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; : &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including nearly the entire main@@ road , very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the ma@@ z@@ zer had been cleared under a big police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter of the last years has become increasingly the Mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : with them there are now residents from the GDR @-@ times and former house@@ keeping with the &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also noticeable in the rental period , which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you recognize them on the disks or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades that were captured with explo@@ ited .
no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
a reason why not all neighbours this as a problem could not be aware that they are not imp@@ acted by the crime of crime : criminal off@@ ences like body violations , statistics show almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make non@@ fiction that ten@@ ds to re@@ build new@@ builds and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , cannot be heard of un@@ certainty .
what violent actions are they important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors , those who have not been determined .
also the famous burning cars will leave it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the studied architect , its street is not a criminal fuel , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the rig@@ a@@ er road - and stayed .
this is why it was also so important that people inhab@@ it their road : from the police , politics and the media , who once in July all claimed the signing of the city .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to go away : through the sl@@ ug@@ g@@ less new@@ builds in former building g@@ aps , which penet@@ rates the old inhabitants .
&quot; that is , finally , con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting for many here - more people living here , who are not so well entered , &quot; says it .
&quot; violence and destruction can I do absolutely eat . &quot;
but what should one do then , if anyone list@@ ens to someone ?
there will be fru@@ stration among all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
for in@@ drawn , which anno@@ yed over colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot;
everyone who moves you should be aware - just like any one that moves into a p@@ ubs which can make po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise .
all people with pre @-@ names presented are asked to be called , not named by their proper name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ ational matters .
Moreover , she is a social worker at site .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee Secretary for Ur@@ bach .
social education supports the team of management by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
you can see as a contact person for all actors : refugees , emplo@@ yers for refugees , administration , authorities and those who still are mit@@ ig@@ ated .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer suggests that the volunteers are more than than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ t now is there , the ei@@ vers of Woll@@ mil@@ let , who has a problem especially .
thus , some - less mo@@ cking as much rather spe@@ ech@@ ing along the multitude of your task - commonly referred to as the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for a talent in talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , a female pure wo@@ ol@@ factory .
but administrative work is not its central area , tells An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
especially , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the curtains as well as networks .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
she has held a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that An@@ ni@@ ka Engl@@ ish@@ le hon@@ ors and main actors are supported .
there are big and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
you will soon be new container in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a hard problem for some time to find flats for the connection p@@ ests that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection material .
you must place the refugees in own or rented flats .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the municipalities themselves .
responsibility is changing from the land@@ line with local community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not any owner wants to offer his apartment .
it has been a very difficult time for some time .
de fac@@ to find the administration no private apartments .
it did not work yet so far , to be mentioned in private apartments , so Deu@@ t .
therefore , the common dwellings must be am@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
a perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a firm lead , there are also intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants which need to be frozen or cultivated .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ates and very ne@@ at@@ ly told , such as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
they hopes that the work for the joint venture leads to a positive result .
this was &quot; no employment therapy &quot; .
he does not mean work yet .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and client .
people would have to develop a sen@@ i@@ ority .
so it offers offers such as sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so the administration and honorary volunte@@ er may also be paid here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they wish to be in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it takes and can be over@@ crow@@ ded the time , for example with language courses .
whoever doesn &apos;t feel the feeling of evolution , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , will not work and be un@@ profitable to never integrate them .
the distinct majority would be motiv@@ ated .
problem cases are , however , says customer hon@@ est , &quot; people where nothing goes on . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is a &quot; Mamm@@ ut@@ task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two most recent inci@@ dents in front of Radi@@ c@@ alisation , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ly is the hel@@ per but already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they had the fear that the perpet@@ rators bring them completely into consideration .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Re@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and honorary positions must be taken on site and in the region for activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new store for refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach could come .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question clear to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair to place it hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we are not there where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher was able to integrate the previous person in rati@@ onal .
currently , these are around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women are one .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no ordinary answers .
chim@@ ney : gl@@ itter@@ ing with Hel@@ icop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew on for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two un@@ well @-@ known males are already visible on Friday morning at 8.50 am in an apartment in a multi @-@ family home in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and defeated the Un@@ hol@@ de in her escape .
the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters in size , probably m@@ asked , contributed both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled towards the city centre .
to compens@@ ate the police , several strikes , as well as a police helicopter .
the feeding went without success .
perhaps the unknown in fact fell close to the apartment or at their escape .
