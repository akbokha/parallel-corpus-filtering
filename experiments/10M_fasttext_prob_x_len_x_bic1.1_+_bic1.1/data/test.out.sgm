<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure, the trade agreement TTP prevent to prevent Clinton as well as trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are subject to tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">View of the state's role.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to hold in doubt very small in doubt, as the state of the economy does harm - with tax and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton slugged the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Himself on the other hand it would be different, claimed to be Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will decrease regulatory deposits, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said to prevent: the state has appointed certain tasks to open the disabled chances and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To the fact, Trump and Clinton are nearly equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the government's national apartament wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So you could listen to partitian internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and drive coal hydrates in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in the protected areas so far as he wants to terminate the climate protection agreement in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to strengthen the renewable energies with their investment program, and calls for: "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, both competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Datazide trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to isolate international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are then to be paid better, subject to Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger remuneration.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What you want to do in this question isn't clear: once he says: the minimum wage should be down, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the large discussion of the next months is probably more likely to develop the control policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one side is Trump, who wants to strain the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who want to ask at least of the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics saying: more tax are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every living woman has gained experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who have fled almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a big kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everyone has a baby, that is not one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her small son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guises with great eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starving onto the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiling short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the managing director of Condrobs, a carrier of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live at the Munich north, one of the few decentralised women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs established the institution together with a Sagrada Familia and Munich's contribution.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been unlong since it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is no man - not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a wax before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who comes here comes on her escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted, because of them torture or death, or because their families are sending them as a hopes of their hopes in Europe," says it.</seg>
<seg id="24">While women do not have any other reasons for the escape: "many steal away from it, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced to coloration, honour of honour, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">They drive it off.</seg>
<seg id="27">The escape goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"so, for example, tug for a bottle of water require sexual action, no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who think the end as soon as they came in Germany, say, told us.</seg>
<seg id="31">Too, all women in refugee camps would often be regarded as a decrease in times and when misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the residence in the north of Munich, is sad.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so usual that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they trusted not to speak openly about the earth, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not help to help, there's more accommodations just for them, calls Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they walled from a similar project such as in Munich in their jurisdiction, respond some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken there are not something in the governments of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben, women are not accommodated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press preference for the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are accommodations in some areas on the grounds or their own houses only for single-standing women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament is calling for women separately to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the Committee, it is said: "it is very important that men and women are separated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated together, can come to - forgetting - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separated and accessible for women easily, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As very the women will feel the need of this protection, you can read the rush of rush on the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been talking about that there are us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">It could easily arise a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy agent of the assistants have called to their union to tackle new workers struggles with their disputes regarding a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested his entire Council, from the beginning of September more working ampleurs.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that there were ministers to go to the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistants and medical students have been adapted to the rejection of a contract signed by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the election.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC McCourt, said the government had remained quiet "to cause problems that the contract was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "in view of this, the JDC board has voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official talks about all the concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">As an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC board has set up a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to start a running program of calendar campaign, beginning of September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of foreign workers"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and the official end of the eight months of the war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin grants his Turkish counterplayers in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot hide myself from the prescription that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putinto smile had a narrower and irradiated heat, even for his return conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, said "Putin - according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had claimed to work as though, would never be something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me about the opposite to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant vision showed that Russia's state of affairs did not forget Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to elect in his execution: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was sore burning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin turned out and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The verge was even larger, since it was committed by a friend friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will be difficult when not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">The state-controlled media carried out a violent, unconditional attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to be the Turks what was the Turks.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations from senior officials reported that Erdogan's own family could have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He made this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was, that it was time to look forward to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place only because Putin was given to excuse Putin by the President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">The advantages of a ceasefire is clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is required primarily in the first line of all friends who can receive, after the last month he was at a failed coup d "état of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions were hard hit in Turkey - especially the prohibition of charters who usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charities will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late aisant of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecasts fruits and vegetables, once the Turkish agricultural waste will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists for long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West since it was the reaction to power in power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">The lasting Groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - it turns out to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian president won a bonus gained in Ankara with safety that he called for a coup d'etat for the chosen state of state.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is a self-understood for Moscow to change the self-sitting fear of Regimechange.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace made it possible by Russia and Turkey, one, as it was described to me a analytics once: two countries that will drive away from the West and are poorly treated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as peacekeeping force, but where Russia and Turkey support each other pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be indicative that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference they said that they would not take the topic once more.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey forged it intentionally to a question about their disagreements, while Putin decided to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator may be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months, open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as the NATO member of Turkey's Russian martial jet - it certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with million pounds of Sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to draw more national brands in focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, decentralised headquarters and stock exchange will switch to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller stamps for the private customer business to receive more significance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in Inverness Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB is being one of our Investors" brand, as well as the brand to be employed among our employees, since we are now more into a bank of brands. "</seg>
<seg id="15">When the Bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now, we don't want to pursue global targets, but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every of these brands will stand in their own municipalities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue his Six Nations Sponsoring anymore and that it will increase the truth of various brands in its Sport Sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop themselves to the bank of the stamps, as we are looking inside (we asked) to make it a better bank for customers?" said the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical before three years ago, if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think there will be many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can start these stamps again, therefore I think that the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was later protested and Chief of Staff of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the main task of government to support your activity as a state of Staff to bills and controls to implement your statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked his position to leave his position and recommended to Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuaded the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This stage has been mysteriously in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov had long been one of the closest confidentists Vladimir Putin and works as he has been working for Soviet Intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted in television on television, both men retreated that Chief of Staff is on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the differentiation for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, here is the consequence of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">I currently knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once glorified as a potential President once glorified as the Russian environmental policy would have met on large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the Website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you to put forward to this very complicated item - you could almost say - to trust in a post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it emerged, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov has taken the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin was a former member of the Security Council of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the German-Security Service (FSB), Ivanov has been appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he became the one of five people, whom he trusted at most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could have been President of Putin after putting him to the second term of Putin, as a third term of Putin was beaten against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another, near allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin has became prime minister before he became president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="8">The German Minister, Keith Brown, took part in the building site today and was one of the first to go out of the country on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensland Crossing."</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a home activities that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the whole bridge decks in their place and the last section of the Decks gets today in Rosyth a concrete finish for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted along the bridge at its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first seal is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of the trendsetting high and deep building represents.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installation of the last street cover and its connection with the Northturmdeck, we had to close the still existing gap on the North or Landscape.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the Northern Reducer Bridge 700 millimeter south.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved with an incline of approximately 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green My: investors are expected to be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How can I respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose close to 1300 budget apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a "handful concept housing."</seg>
<seg id="5">But the dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first line it is about the question: who is supposed to build the low-priced apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Leader, Christoph Bratmann, said: "we are pleased with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in the future, 20 percent of all apartments have to come out as social apartments."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favourable apartments can also occur in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the great controversy in the town hall is, however, so violate: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new city of housing, the million cost will cost and will be funded, scheduled to take care of incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so violinist: "there are currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors a few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The linkke wants to have hardness conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what, as frying, the situation asked for a deepening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The project concept is implemented and will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will receive skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not fully understand: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, that should be certainly not built.</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you get the loss of another around 1300 professional apartments that will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, such as the planner spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to go back into the price list.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">A blow would solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">It remains at the end of the year at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could take back home in the price of cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only that the owners, housing companies do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social apartments in the West city is drastically increased, it is removed from the aim of the so-called.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weak in only few quarters.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be still movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, as the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child for playing no longer go outside, but rather preferable to spend their free time to spend on screens, was used in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go to get people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities can not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I build myself of course at the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters, which were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon animation, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players are looking forward to their smartphone outside and search for Pokémons looking for a GPS, once they were found once, "photographs" (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "can be captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was yet younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that determines the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardijk, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who play Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public connaissance campaigns to health, people want to bring "30 minutes to come" to come "from the sofa," and "every day will be active on a deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come to people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport does not exceed sport.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports, reduces its chances to get cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that are too long to view it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is for people to do something in the open, that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt for new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also mute games that must always complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone may walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it meant to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had already been able to follow our activity as Fitbit, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose his riz and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to poker's success, there will be more games that can join apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, and helping to help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present at the gymnasium in the Turns and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been on the Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnuns, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who is inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of these crew, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Avencian, the Catholickin is round, makes all proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the past four years, the number one under female Turnero was a Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gabby Douglas celebrated his last Olympic Champions and America at the last Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible power of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymasticans.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was awarded the fourth, heterosexual US Americans, who gained gold medal for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but they do not see turnaround classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit the same way as Aly and Madison, to make it the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics are only four gymnuns in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a Trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that turns a more expensive sport, and Turner at first line in private gymnasties that will be reckoned by parents that will come from parents, competition and hotel charge (for the trainer and their Turner and families). the list can continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnkey are in high-habitable suburbs that support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Turner is their complete training and that is for families a expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities of innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an excellent and easy-to-reach exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TurnFoundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer free and affordable tourneys in Harlem for more than 15.000 people (mostly black and hispanic) in Harlem for more than 15.000 people (mostly black and hispanic).</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to meet the youth high quality exercises that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and destination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides lifelong benefits for health and academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastic and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabon and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic World Team and thank you to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intenving of the training, to ensure that employees usually make sure that voters leave the electoral cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falling over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case there was no penalty.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court, Luton Rahman, and his deputy, declared to corrupt and illegal practices as untausible," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a safer place for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to move with armed robbers at hand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Irrespective of whether you approach either from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to rotate the spear.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are rected from behind, you should make sure that you can see your attackers, so that you can see your attackers "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you hitting it with your free ellbow to face.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then turn him down with the knee to the dead and turn up, while the attackers shake off pain and turn off the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards, while they set the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers who approach themselves from the front, the technique is similar to move your body from the Line, take the weapon and turn them, so the attackers can't shoot anything.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lay at the same time the weight on the gun and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn the weapon from its handle before moving backwards and raise the weapon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright for a guide with his tongue to the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler undernourished the immune system and sausage at a serious examination - having failed some of the most dirty and most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travelling or Ian Wright, 51, out of Suffolk will cope with a railing pot of migratory toilet and a public telephone in Russia to proof the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he will leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to pull the flush-knob of a pull-out toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen spans.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he ablered, more than a bad breath in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intestines by going through the world as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to rinsing shoots up to rinsing toilets, the task set its immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a kid I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have set all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In his film, he was justified in his sight.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a luminance of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminome-number is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet to refusing to refusing their luminance of 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a lower than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this is the worst thing I have done in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not anchored here because it is inscribed here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefiltrus that contains both lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation of Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">A little bit fascinating to the watch and at the same time the advantages of Probiotics "was declared.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted mad Brainstormings, so that we said "Lass call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They assert that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just over the products, we wanted to present them into a greater context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary could provide the consumer's consumer more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directed, said: "let me say that - I had lost my respect for Ian, if he had chosen some of the things I have told him, as the English Russian toilet, which will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to bring them, and others, where it was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty leakeup on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a validation survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents in lactic acid bacteria are particularly associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products that contain the lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older child.</seg>
<seg id="12">She is reminiscent of her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and danced.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First because it is musically exceedingly!</seg>

<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021, the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the monastery has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For so far as far as you don't go: summer vacation, heat and landslide combat - that will bite.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are to be convinced by the electoral boxes are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most tourists who are in the countryside are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not domestic, so you may not choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">To this, practical problems: in the holidays are helpers, the posters hang up, distributing air balloons, flyers and choked at the end of the vote, just labors.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave the people just over the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, if you can say that at all, just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something like Prime Minister, Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to do his position.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting how strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of Koalitionst augurly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celering, 66 years old, and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one can see from his posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, roses roses and plaught a little with the people as it did already his legendary wortful predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="19">She has been invited to major German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel's German Bundestag and Merkel has been in the northeast of Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of foreigners from other Länder," defendant Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But there is a shame even from other corners of Germany to hear Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost CDU largely renounced the usual campaign distances on market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's how cocaine, games are still a minor role. "</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that you have to put away on the ground that it has to become very persistent, again a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You go like the Left, the SPD, the Green: in the times of the country it is hardly available.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU elections to his fellow soldier is, however, self-larvingly: "you must go where there are people: Dorneste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot in the game stands, Sellering has now called up its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and only scarcely in the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD was still allied with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in the polls, may make the leap into the Parliament in the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern Tugend, a modern Tugend, and disguise their suffrage to be largely on the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the speed, with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to catch up.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the leaders of the construction work, starting at 5.30 in the morning and only around 20 o'clock in the morning, there is always the praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made everything quite delicate," says Elvira Tetzeaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a superb team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be shifted to the south at the weekend of October, by the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">Blessed is also the abbreviation of the responsible for the construction works, when it comes to the establishment of accommodation drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday to the south is velled and the rejection of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was removed and thus the connection to Rottenburg is relaxed, the traffic situation is relaxed within the place.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens now come from Ofterdingen out of the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The expulsion of traffic through the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," says the Deputy Director of the Restoration Assistant Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachel road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many battles were sought and more their Navi trusted as the signposts.</seg>
<seg id="14">What caused by some trucks in residence areas in Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="15">The speed limes were not included in order to reinforce the forces from Mössing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant changes," says King, who himself made the location above the location itself.</seg>
<seg id="17">There were already two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The liner was on the way with 77 km per hour at the pace-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">But since the construction site has moved on, it has become a quiet.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg is now open the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people do not have to look at the tickets.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to them to increase revenue quarries, everyone who asks you will look back.</seg>
<seg id="23">However some more and some less are affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customers" has produced less for other companies and has hardly any consequences for the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "no less decline," but also a, of course, "the learner is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">On the strongest were the local road along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, holds markedly.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already strictly threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all guest rooms have hit the 'hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">We are missing the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rota wedge.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about each Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">The revenue fell by far to "far above 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">Road building took his operation "by two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="34">He must have dismissed half of his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the host has benefited from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it is also the disadvantages taken by the sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other rural districts, where something spacious has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family estate has already been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is possible to understand that other regular guests should be less frequent in less frequently due to the complicated transport management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you don't want to ride, it is also nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his master clientele receded to the end of the refurbishment, Göhner does not doubt any doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and a bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced his place in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, which is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The terrorist control in law is constantly smoking in the name of the terrorist control.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, the Minister of Interior de Maizière is now a thick security package.</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>

<seg id="7">They want to challenge them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also participation myself.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the Minister of the Interior, however, he is situated on outcome and at a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">Following the youngest attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière presented a little time before transferring his conclusions for security in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are however more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot is already familiar, announced, announced that a new security authority should take care of the Knighting encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor the fact that Germany must implement several EU regulations on flight information and arms.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprisingly unsurprisingly.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for proposals to do so far with the SPD: he wants to make sympathizers for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German pass.</seg>
<seg id="17">"that will be difficult for the SPD," the CDU of the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="18">He still keep this for reasonable and challenging any thing that has no chances for the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas to be presented de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are partly in itself: it is planning quick procedures for shifts and more opportunities for detention in front of deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are brought to target country, should check out their smart phones and make social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">When accepting asylum seekers he wants to present some even worse than before - such, the offenders go away or deliberate their papers in order to seize their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manure works even unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of Gedulfed for example - is the question: what does that actually do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to speak in speaking, that the assassination of Ansbach and Wuerzburg there were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many people in the presence of the high refugee are worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that are employed by people, now there were no wise chambers in election periods.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormous throughout the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Just the suggestions in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach is then.</seg>
<seg id="33">The disguarding is large.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are elections.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD leaders get increasingly on the topic of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days it went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garstworthy dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then establishing a security policy collection of some of the Unions's ministers, in which resortchefs also require a burka-prohibition and a return to double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière labors here for narrowable tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a departure from the double pass he doesn't stop.</seg>
<seg id="40">We satisfying the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">You newly elaborate, don't make sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">And by a Burka ban he did not enter any constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is valid at all corners, and whether it is actually "reasonable" is for the coalition partner, it must still show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in what could cause strife.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is currently trying to profiling on the topic of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the USA, where exhaust gas affaires initially escalated, is also further a minus beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, mainly affected house stamp of Lower Saxony would continue through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only one delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January to July, the Chief of Staff Fred Kappler was able to demonstrate a sales charts from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated by a software exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW has about 2.5 million cars to retrofitting the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the wake of the rearmament VW, the reconstruction of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to retrofitting of the vehicles, it is equivalent to fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">The passenger arrives to the customer following their disarmament "guaranteed" certificate, but did not talk of a "guarantee" as it was given on Friday in Corporate News.</seg>
<seg id="24">The foundation of legal forms.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen granted his German customers yet a guarantee for new diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was approved the last Monday of Monday by representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport was confirmed that it was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has concluded the stipulations of my investigating committee and the KBA once again."</seg>
<seg id="29">"variations of that are not accepted," stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or engine power after retrofitting does not take any deterioration and all typical forms of relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not how it was in corporate services.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen is the possibility that customers can come from a half year after retrofitting for example with a motor damage in a workshop - and this could cause the new software to do nothing, even if the damage has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the customer's interest it is important to avoid that with some other damages we have nothing to do with the abassal scandal that comes to an imassurance as possible warranty claims, such as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, the term "guarantee" is not using.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who do you buy records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you are talking to commitments to skip him under the pseudonym non-Alleanvelous-age age with harsh claims, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, the reconstructed re-formation of records are not looking forward to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the unity of physical objects, but on Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely fault group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby - it has a emotional meaning: older record runners retain their feelings more to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy them alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I am in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest appearance that I stop, my hands hold and a little effort like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly getting to its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now fill into the building where independent seller is located - there is a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera's camera to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various husbands in such shops and try to estimate her age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it a collectors I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This records, pictured above (he sent to me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed by home), clothe walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy boards that he could not afford, when it was released and once more items he sold when he had been young and plexes.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably had to have something too young to buy them." he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy plates, rather choices and like to spend time alone, and add: "I smoke not and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25 who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets YouGov profile will meet again.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and show to purchase their old records back again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the discussions that I have led, people usually have taken away their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy themselves, sell their CDs to purchase their records back again, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only some seconds in a shop such as phonica to realize that record shops offers a relaxing community of equities.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers assumped to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overthrown by the digital world and want to go back to the stability of trusted sils, from objects that watch the lucky adult education.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or ownership of your property as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are as their social worker!" they killed one employee from one record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">In April, a survey of the ICM revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record have not been heard of the last month.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player who never use them while 7% of those who buy one plate, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I had a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, which works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle ages) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone wasn't recently here clean and said:" I don't have a record player but I would like to buy a Radiohead soundplate, so I would like to put them into shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product loads, less music sounds.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">That are younger people, not older that are only to purify slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fold, that has dedicated the sound of records almost a whole floor, has an underlower audience as I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists, the photos make, teenager and women aged age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts latest syntheses and sextapped pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them can be separated, but nagile psychotic traumata are difficult, if one stands for someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs in business for some minutes and considers the Varietows of the available records.</seg>
<seg id="49">It has more a mannea bumps as a big buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserve many, so is the collectors of records no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is... "they drives with a soft sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the licence to number the jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teous girls who grouped up for a moment to purchase Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics that essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for this item could mean more money for the industry, and some of the clients could send in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research-researches revealed that the results of YouGov leave it, at least in business transactions in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record holder who exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumber through plate shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while standing the starring of an unmistakian, 30-year-old moderator, who rises not over the shoulders of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live in the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a hearing this week, the authorities argued that the state should have jurisdiction in Calais, to sell 72 temporary business operations in which people within the bearing can sell, hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture are argued that these places would be overthrown, because they would be paid a parallel economy, out of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups distributed the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the order of people who operate the 72 temporary business, but I was thinking that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "is absolutely trackable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role as a mere people live "live in extreme conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the locations that was threatened by defeats was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des camp, which is charnered and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as an advice regarding demand for asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure "for this child would be a disaster of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants rated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle bodies increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number is now - according to a steep rise of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Great Britain brings silver in the 7-er Rugby, after Fiji Masterclass Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">The most impressive performance of British accession to the 7-er Rugby came on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated by a result of 43-7 in the Deodooro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line running and rox power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was caused by the unpoor troop price of silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on that same day could fall on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless of these, Fiji had a 15-man crew in the form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - at least one Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Chief trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost her game under Ryan every game when Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">You lost only one here.</seg>
<seg id="11">These sleek will be weary, but the progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started marquely and caused the attacks of GBS from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co. on, one would run into running coaches. the World Series winners went 5-0 to top, when the sea Kolinisau returned to the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of game play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB did hardly accept the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hunted tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to attain a third goal but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua saw a touch down and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-pfiff and still existed over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefeted by another weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still exists.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is so too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and completed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions for the first half time, until Joshua Tuisova was running after a roilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt on GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favour of the southern Consulate, whose fans cheeks, felt and dance on the funnel.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to see the playable approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-cake with a further attempt in recent seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pupil blended, the Fijis embraced and GB briefly defeated in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">In former days Fiji Japan had defeated 20-5 in semifinals and the Great Britain pushed South Africa in a close half final match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the ground in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton went through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the positions in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late tackling of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-side teams, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the Trainers as a rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There is no emotional gold than with this games and I want to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the very first rash to the last, 220 hard Hieve, that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the ones who sat at the resting place, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympic champion in a row without tax, the first women in the history of British Sports, which laid a scale of such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, all of you say 39.more unconditional use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes that glides over the surface with the elegance of Schwules, which does not reflect the kind of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the Ruins, a battalion will contribute to content helpers that make the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach, who would not survive this day ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, being operational and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fortunately, fortunate was fortunate that he could be at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could lead the interruption to a minimum, if that in such circumstances it is the right concept.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore it had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">It starts so.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing at itself is already a challenge, but this makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of the victory there went their first thoughts on Williams, who spend some more than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was the centurion of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, "I was this week a emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means a lot."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is just repeated that this means how much I and Helen and that Robin became involved.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no man, therefore a massive Danke goes to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to trainer or need a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to queued, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very well caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in trial."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let not rip.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something bad.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to have no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result to go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take away for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear in a wedding next week, their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now it wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London there was about six months to realize that I'm a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels like much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The risk of energetically and energetic German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burden, threatened by the industry from the eco-world promotion, are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It stays in the liberation of the Renewable Energies in the inventory for the so-called own power production in the German steel industry, the Federal Minister of Agriculture Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Western German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm really glad that we could finally reach negotiations after two years."</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the European Commission, the European Commission therefore planned to ask the steel producers, the gases from the high-furnace for power generation, to ask the checkout.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry sector, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, it is a certificate of principle with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when generators be replaced in the steel structures, an EEG monitoring of 20 percent should be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="10">But these also shall not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed Germany's unification with the EU Commission to own power production.</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that the status Quo was largely written down by the previous regulation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our Campaign" Stahl is the future 'is the first step. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow"</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions rights are climate and employment targets," said IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsens further, as the world's largest producer in China, faced with the weakening national demand of custom steel on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers represent Chinese steel ropes price cuts.</seg>
<seg id="20">During this spring the situation has something relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">To show a showcase, import duties on importer effect, and others have brightened economic prospects in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the pricing is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus ThyssenKrupp was cautious in Thursday on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lastly, the prices are again stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp wanted to not exclude ThyssenKrupp in order to exclude factions of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015 around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers remain cautious in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced at 3.4 million tonnes, and six percent less crude steel than during the previous year as the German economic unification took place on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May the amount therefore returned to the second month in a row.</seg>

<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp did in her choir: "to arrange and organise themselves to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of merit."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing can be positive in the positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>

<seg id="24">The self-feeling of self-esteem is growing by singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Himself to show yourself: if I am long for something, I'll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Everyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he comments, little talent, you will avenge Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">People are not singing alone - with 50 singled people, who listens when doing a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">One can simply join the acquaintance of a senior chamber, one can simply connect himself.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="32">For those who want to sing in a clesiastical choir, you can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors rounds can be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask help at the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="5">The market was obligated to power the facilities at its disposal, due to justifiable foundations.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens and industrial enterprises from caters, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lens, Lindenberg and Zultenberg must pay deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As chairman of the board of Herbert Schmidt on the panel, a new calendar was necessary for waste water sanitation facility.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercoverages from the previous year issuing period are included.</seg>
<seg id="10">In all three sewage facilities, Schmidt thus established that there are relatively small establishments with a very low sewage storm, which fly between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, due to its low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would result in effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, the wastewater treatment is slightly declining in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, during the past calendar period, all three plants will not last year due to their age, refurbishment and repair expenses in a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the plants for caters, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="18">The same applies for electricity costs which were significantly below the present level at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone cottages made clear that at low sewerage in the three plants the expenditure for the operation and maintenance is full throttle. "</seg>
<seg id="20">In this case, Schmidt is the market leader of large entertainment cost over the sewage plants in the past 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Milanese citizens of the United States Central Command changed restoring information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria as it is allowed to have the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the republican Members of the Armed Forces, reported a great dissatisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Service, reported to change their evaluations in the struggle against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"News services, which were typically accepted by high-level CentCom Commander, reported regularly a position in order by the American efforts to combat terrorism, and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," cited newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at CentCom, is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, firm.</seg>
<seg id="7">The guide error in CentCom goes up to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct notice to modify the government peaks under Obama, it shows how analysts predict the pressure from their pre-laws to record an optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as of the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before the Congress were clearly positive than the facts of the facts.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom members publicly announced that a military retreat took place in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second biggest city of Iraq, remains under the control of Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the months of investigations', he is as much clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Kansas, published in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leader of the Central Command has changed the declaration of conformity with ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans recalled the Task Force, after playing them, analysts predict concerns relating to the manipulation of reports to Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, CentCom reports are further investigation by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in the Gange.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published its own insights on Thursday, coincide with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom presented an overcharged process for creating significant contributions in Isil and the Iraqi security services," the tallest democracy in the Comac committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, announced in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, as Mr. ship, "delayed the publication of subsequent reports," pouched the morals' analysts' and delivered very little space for different opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ships and the Democrat stated no remarks on a intervention of the White House in CentCom analysts as regards a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast" on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times of Investments reported by the Pentagon's general inspectorate, which were surveyed by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, announced in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector are still in action.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes impacted out opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of the national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have relied on the question of a successful air campaign under American guidance in Iraq and Syria (a statement that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year, however, rejected the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for consuming military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminders of Zwistutes from more than ten years ago when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a text on the question of many analysts, saw only a small creeping force in Iraq and had little time pointing out on the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hookers, according to the government agencies, states that contrary the statements of the government had no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisionally refineries would have been put into operation at the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his revised positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008 because they didn't qualify for the ader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which she left for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn the things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, an investment change, and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't had the work spensing in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can completely pluck the rest completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a setback from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly, and stayed at the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She carried out a sprint with the shallow ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and luckled the ball to the Americans for a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the goalkeeper of the US, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a goal in any of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good is the result of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro is constantly being resistant and irrelevant, a race relay between competition and streches.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the olympic torch itself would be a burning rod that will protect their swimmers to the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not read the televisions, a newspaper read or hearing during your neighbor in the waiting-long at Coffeshop, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then it is yet Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a girl of women with dimples, could definitely be sent to Prime Time, where he would have been built to Prime Time, when he would be a swimmers, Turner, or even Fomb.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, was fighting in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade there are the sports that are not generally acknowledged: air springs, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I really want to make arguments for my specific darling, then leave the attention to the discreet charm of the trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp jump have already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, the last 16 years suffered so much that many of them had asked, I didn't know that it was at all an Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States had prepared for competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampolini and had a athlete up until 2012, who made it until the end of the round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tends to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The tramp jump has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ears of a clownsschule as the for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I ought to admit that I am no expert, but only a faithful enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoning trembling of its never to swollen outpralls - but also the grazie of the turnaround and divers, which combines two sports that essentially combines it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which is as much as "dive board."</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot at almost 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling moves (turning, real and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to the official Olympiaproogram according to version, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-one athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes, and back, up and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt only the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV broadcast another cave target: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented Streets is Nobel, admil value, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir up a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself thinking to look at this games as something unwanted.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolini is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or them pruned up, seemingly heavy heap like a astronaut, then go down, then downwards again, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectonic attack on the goal, no ravening in the distance, only the dreumeric, elegant end of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen such as the competition on the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men are also on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the drauds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Manie they speak a quiet, nice moment, one who probably is overthrown in general.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness could only be reached by the attacking and the object of male athletes - as recently struck the male's Turner according to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr. Dooley expects his way to air, new fans.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long one of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, demand political changes in Ethiopia, hit the violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesting of the police were killed by policemen of the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Where Ethiopia are gathered together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable African countries, a solid group of Western Europe with rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But during the last months of the protests against the government, protests against the government and spread themselves abroad.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people caught up on the streets and the fundamental fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response to the government was unmerciful to human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen killed unarmed demonstrators killing and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals smite young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handover against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands an ongoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to join this country and in future it will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiopians, in order to combat terror over the region, particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cush economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new Pendlerin in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia are all others as a role for democracy - human rights organisations have progressed the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effective immediately to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned in exile or put them into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopians.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth were protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation was protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from ground use up to the sausages in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a broadly critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time rises the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these jagged, controversial line required in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced over the past few years, could recover the turbulence and they could be armed with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of defences after years of crumns now explode on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopian people were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what is done in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still communicate via Internet proxies, conceal where they keep up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Cush gave heed that they were so too protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orochi and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the aeons prospered the Amharas, which come from branches of Ethiopia in Russia, in politics and economy, while they had exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in flat lands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this changes also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen" says Mulatu Beechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population, and which are dominant in the military, in secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenadawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebellion led to his death on a non-public disease in 2012 17 years, Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man that could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly levered to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to make adversaries, and to make them undamaging.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on this basic field," Mr Abdi, a conflict analysis.</seg>
<seg id="46">Cush, new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected in relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Otherwise, Mr. Meles, who came from the Ethiopian Mountains in Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysis reports that he can do not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fears that the result will be more bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time in Ethiopia in 2005, Ethiopia was trying to protested thousands against elections which were done according to the analysis of Analytical and then stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following Razzien were killed, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this period of disturbances passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praising Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlersuit, and for their measurable progress in the poverty control.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this does not have the intenving of the interiors of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it occupies a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month joined forces in Gondar, an amharic city, by Tigray led stores and the hatred against the tigray in the social media is always usual.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analytics say that protests in the USA and other Western allies have a distinct position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights on the adjacent Somalia, even if they recently divided that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly intends to support democracy, he doesn't want to compile his alliance in a already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr Abdi, "is a very thin ski hike."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama to have ISIS was "Sarkasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy on Friday, giving his campaign, that his repeatedly repeated claims, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist state of Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions concerning communication skills of the Republicans of the Republicans whether it is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its fellow soldier, who endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protection to explain in the stockings which he could not have.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the adoption of a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made reference to the allegations on Thursday and existed in interviews to indicate that he did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning star, Mr. Trump said, he is simply satified.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast to the previous day, Mr. Trump said to whom Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he thought to be entirely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump wanted to help something to destroy him, saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate could not know anything of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism of Mr. Trump came down, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of expulsion of the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped speeches in Michigan at this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return again this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clint would lead proposals to higher taxes and that he was boring her speech.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm at his defense against it.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he attracted strongly criticisms than he meant the Russians should have Mrs. Clint enamils, but he later explained "Of course" Of course. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows to postpone Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then returned to rudern.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test, like certain messages received from his fans, as they come, and then if necessary," according to how the reaction is taken. "said Ruth Sherman, an communication expert, which observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think, too, he is smart enough to keep his statements, so that they can be interpreted in different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump took one more corrosive sound, since its polling values continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tried to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he is accused of having assassinated his reviews or understand his testimonies.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is reinforced with the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Purze would have brought into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of what provokant seems to have his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercession, attracted major efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was interviewed for the correctness of Mr. Trumps. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, that he called her backbender, completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans have to argue that the government served as an Foreign Minister in which Mrs. Clinton had allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Near East of aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump carried out his attacks on the media and did to fight them on every his word and preoccupied it against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the poor, chunuchs, "TV experts who try to understand him and said," You cannot tell it! "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked over Mr. Trumps, merely a further proof that he was not suitable for the Presidential Office.</seg>

<seg id="18">"it must have been in the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in a US budget, mainly in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-buffet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest eddy is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rarely sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland is usually only available in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats up to the North Atlantic with just a 1 km / h.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland did not get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Feeble the Greenland area at the bottom of the North Atlantic along the ground, it is just 1,220 metres away on average.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes up, the five metre long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of loneliness of lonely lifestyle seems to be a godfather for a tall age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report the journal "Science" in any case of Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schick from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan that means a world record for cyclones.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolution of evolution, the evolution biologist believed that Greenland's hails are supposed to be silently.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is hard to observe and eventually they live mainly in the iron ocean in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer to water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the winter only.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-upempo measures them when they were in front of Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">For a prey, the booty make this shark: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the jaw of a young iron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol in the reason of the ice cream and seek Kadaver that finds from higher water layers to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland hails, Fishermen's fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502-centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the animals of the animals, they analyzed the lens of the Haie with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens occurs in front of the birth of the sharks, which will not renew the proteins in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had much carbon-14 in linknucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore in the early 1960s, when atomic tests would try larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In which with 220 centimeters of length, the third-smallest Tier included a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its linear core, however, all major Greenland expedition had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493-centimetre Greenland was showing an age of 335 years, while the record shark should be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females may only get offspring when they are longer than four metres, known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is well positioned on the threshold for the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Grönlandhair with the multiplication was obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">The world record should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the old record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, in whose speck on the neck had a 120-year-old harpoon, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism often survives the living animals to austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they strive ahead - and alps slowed down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm water in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal grow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with an elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a lesser beast that is more dangerous and should concentrate on it as soon as possible as many offspring as soon as possible," says the evolution of the evolution.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, a very big animal should have to invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="19">Even if life quality is a question of preference: "with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," as is the IW.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the last night, Callum Skinner's last night was a glory of fame when the British team defending the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor part that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made itself to Eat. he turned into a legend, as he stormed home, to rescue a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England had a shocking victory over four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympiagoldmedals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after they took place in March at the railway world championships in London, despite the backdrop of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver's Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did it in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they remained, when they saw the potential in the fleets, which now has unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the winner four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner sat down a Olympiarord, but in the qualifying rounds, the New Zealand prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and the Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic change made a large part of transformation from the outcomes in a higher gear to slow it and to enable it to keep it and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as an BBC expert from her position, Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes, when he had climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a Olympiarord in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the page Kennys and Hoys there was hints that he fell down after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no appeal of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said, "It feels like the whole of the GB flagship to the grandstand as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad in so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that had won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it is possible to repeat the Hoys Victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a apparently most holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) were born - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheese is equal to Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">Man can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels quite lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said, "If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was another good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brady Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owner Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-time four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 to the target.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, who won gold in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the contest at the Wiggins, which will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He was disputed yesterday with reference to the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the same period of women's competition that will continue to be continued tomorrow, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team will rely on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a sar at medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly outstanding representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background it's playing in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April middle of sexism and Mobbingvors and retired from sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees itself the first evening of the Competition in Velodrome, it looks quite soon as it could be the legendary GBS that has reached its climax at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the artist and mother of the Cardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted septth edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on its Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people that I love, the appearance of this coverse was crying," wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The disclosure of the Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian family) (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic conclusion: they all have a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the cleeeezed action close to every birthday issued by a Children programme (Seacrest did the set, "You were forgot to have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon animation on a broadcasting station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to take part in this Publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, the new era of the Kardashian began with safety.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her what the Vogue cover is approached (they and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most popular edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a girth that resembles a picture of a fashion magazine than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the bearing 615 on advertising).</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar Prize laureate and dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was born in 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at low chances that Mrs Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "flow-break" of their generation - is under the previous category, is located in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related with famous people, or reality stars or young people from today who know how to do a good Snapchat video (even if everything appears upon Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are able to draw in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce appeared on the last Cover, with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners don't like success each.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenner's position was still clamped in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret Legacy Stephanie Seymour and her colleagues in Gigi Hadid called "the mistakes of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled up again than the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to deal with the misut it seems to be worried at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is based on the cover of the September 2014 edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is in the truest sense of the word a superb model.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your layout of Estee Lauder.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator has arrived on the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successor today dominate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a half, and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite tapped.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory amounted to eight Megabytes, which would now be sufficient for approximately two selections with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabyte.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was launched exactly 20 years ago on August 15, 1996, into the business - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For some Euro lovers can buy the tools in the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age online.</seg>
<seg id="11">But 20 years ago, the Communicator has been a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the Cebit computer fair in Hannover as a "office in West-pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax it was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible with HTML browsers, if also very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone was like to be opened like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen were found.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of an smartphones in Germany was €392.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could happen in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone card of the Finns experienced an unprecedented reaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and wrapped.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today will rule the vendors, which arrived much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always everywhere, that is online today for very many people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold: about 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple were alone 555 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The well-going businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company will come to this end.</seg>
<seg id="30">All industries have now been created around the Smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough into mass market came first at the beginning of 2007, when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac world the introduction of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and a Internet communication to operate everything per touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The winner train of Apple began, today the iPhone is the most important product in the group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had a neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="35">Finally, she wasted to fight Blackberry.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Sages now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, each German has today has 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we have to learn all to push the smartphone even sometimes," said Janina Ball, responsible for personnel.</seg>

<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, there will be such that they will think that the challenge of enlargement of the extension of Heathrows is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England never will be ready for games and that we will be acting on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two subcutters in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each question.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">An option is an option to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in transcenic growth and have a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in the whole of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion most expensive infrastructure programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, that was built in the middle of the world's two frequented run catwalks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third running steer, which is supported by £16 billion at private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I'm confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time to expand this Olympic spirit and Heathrow as well as with our future trading and create a merit of skills and employment, to be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble them of climate control.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-densities could once have experienced similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously pointed out that the slow movement of Venus could be declared throughout their density.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin, dwarlike atmosphere could have continued slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lit up the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet presumably pointed out more dry places than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow movement of Venus regained their daily page of the sun for nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a Rainbow, to shish the surface of a large area of solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of the Venus which resembles Evolution, assumed previously existed before Planetary explores.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was thought to be expected, Venus was exposed to many heat and ultraviolet light over the past few billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide by a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Universal reflecting telescope has helped you to collect the complete catalogue on rotational rates under the star of the star Wars of the Plejades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating in star cluster as well as in which related to the formation of the formation of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that we know through the same of our results with other star clusters, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 lightyears from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, can now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They now turn to the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these attacking stars punches great amounts of stars.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the winds of the stars are travelling, they have a slow down effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star altert, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by recognizes the time between the appearance of an recognizable sterilisation -- such as sunshine --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotational rates shows that more massive stars are slower than a few massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars slower and wanderers than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Plejades we see that slow rotors see to be massive, as well as faster rotors approvise to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="2">The programmers of replacement parts are currently targeted to target companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware infection specialists Malwarder ytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies have at least once again, partially repeatedly victims of a attack with compressors software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already using a Ransomware ination.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly to take advantage of the perpetrators, to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their Erpresser Software according to the observations of Malwarebytes. attacks on Attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for high-resolution delity is significantly higher than in case of private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently observe a terrifying fast evolution of damage software," Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kievcynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the goal, but the switch to the company's work carried out quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an ox, they seek for unlong changed files such as WordPress, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encoded with the Ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the presser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To obtain the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must have money - usually in the form of Crypse malnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where at private use, the personal photo database is available on the game, it is for companies to sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is closed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher when an Evansomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 per cent, even the business activities had to completely break down, in case of a case of people in Fatal.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, multiple hospitals already were threatened by Attacks whose patients can be threatened by loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims: pay out, you only promotes the problem," says Kyzynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of companies pay to pay back their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the support of the perpetrators in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The chipper again know this and try to set up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure examines the payload areas and contact with the crews and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to construct a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You declare their victims per chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will private people be saved after payments from a few hundred euros, companies must pay partly hard negotiate and five-digit sums to get their data undoubtedly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risk winnings from the Ransomware appliction, the chipper are always professional and share the work, explains security professionals Chester Wisniewski from the Internet provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write an Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their contaminant software then in the form of a software building box to the actual compressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by using malware self, consulting and additional tools for one-time fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressers then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums in the substrate, buying the set of a crime and commissions another to install the software on as possible many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inferred calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, crime novels apply with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that guarantee their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies-IT managers in the Malwarning News Survey will trust in Ransomware by file back-ups and scanners software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators now follow new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threats for successful Erpessness, the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," says Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Killzynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential potential for damage, depending on the type of data, more times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators now also could easily take new targets on the Internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the chipper Conference Defcon demonstrated security forscher, such as they could get a connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the heater to block a derive heating could be worth a ransom for a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then use a whole production road instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be subject to an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and non-tagonal</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda leaves everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty excessive, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz has actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V only works very small, the passengers have much space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and are comfortable, only the cockpit-top falls below.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not just a trunk space of 453 l at high resolution and 1026 l with reworked back keys, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">That is less magical, as it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be high-fold and offer the storage space, which is high up to the ceilings 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk protection can be loaded well, however, the load height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to make his work a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The versatile consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is another engine: a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering deflection should be somewhat direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The design included in the tested top variant "Executive" has no wishes to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among the safety systems, the City Notbrake system (runs until the tune of 32), the collision system and trace assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision avoidance sometimes, because he has been rated as "heralarms objects" when maneuvering many obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator reacts on traffic sign recognition and drosselt when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the most powerful connectivity is available only for the top quality: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI connector are connected under the armrest and therefore can easily be reached.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, the petrol engine receives from 20,000 euros in the diesel of 23000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda has a versatile and everyday use car.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the freeway</seg>
<seg id="2">It stole regularly on the runway - here a picture from November.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, this should change: the legal biespespur should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is good news for all car drivers who stand in the trade show every evening in Stau when it comes across the highway Azubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road of road construction extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) between the Hammer Street and the exit Weseler road by 700 metres.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drive in front of the hammer road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The great advantage: the traffic subdivided early, thus improving the general course of course in the multiple section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The drive close at the Zubringer sucks the drivers most from 17 to 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the back au reaches the bridge over the Albersloped path and sometimes also beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the conifers at the B 51 shortly before the Weler road.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic can only be accessed via the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be rebuild in front of well-thirteen years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required lifting capacity, especially to record heavy duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the associated stress has passed continuously, the state of the country cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, at the time of years, for the bridge, the bridge has an official duration of up to 2034.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you wallowing for ever, at night, you reach the wake in the morning, in the morning it is already far from the wake-up sounding.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, these problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disturbance and over ten percent feel common to sleep often or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping troubles or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep problems, and there are many different causes that are based on them emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, a member of the German Society for Pain and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what you understand, however, the Insomnie, therefore, an input and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jens Wagenknecht, Jens Wagenknecht, says Jens Wagenkirish, is a member of the German home medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the inter alia, organic, psychological, non-related factors, but also medications are plugged.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping expression of a different disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is especially important in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors are preferable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have herniated a herniated disc can be bad, wake all the two to three hours and begins to greet on everyday problems, and there is an example, Weeß is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when to do with sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and will be impaired on the day, should go to the physician, avenged Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look different: one is smitten, tired, tired, has trouble with the attention and the concentration, is easily irritable, has voices fluctuations or physical afford such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to disrupt the sleep, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>

<seg id="24">The problem can clarify if the problems have an physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be going to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleeping laboratory physician, for example with respiratory failures, in case of severe diarrhobility, in sleep errors or if you don't find the cause of a diasive disorder,</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not sleep lunch," says Fifty.</seg>
<seg id="30">After stuffing, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes, one nose poggles, a chest strap and a spraler on fingers.</seg>
<seg id="32">A camera also shows a camera on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches on which one can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and rise up, not too long in bed, don't sleep, watching television to sleep, alcohol and at night not at the clock - then we begin to look at once and that's all and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altlords, a few linking pools, in between still another head stone pains: the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight, but the police counts them among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the east from east to west, you arrive at playing places, a refreshed kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>

<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished shortly before: by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, is illustrated in the last weeks however prefers with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents were rented, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, since the beginning of the year, the police of Berlin had several times a tough approach to the project, the area as "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, arrested three weeks, according to official statements for three weeks before the site, locked parts of the street and kept visitors from it, the house with the number 94 entered.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers in order to open the unfamiliar house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon, the road turns peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the brush in front of the houses in the sun, others have talked about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects, there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left Violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in the "Kiez" since 1999, and Jana *, who has generalized three children, are mostly from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects, they share the care before increasing tenants and gentlenticulation.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a "Kiez" who wished the majority of polishing protection from vandalizing the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior cubator and the police open between housekeeping and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional labour-quarter, which also resulted in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average and high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Offices and the natives were too long for the "Kiez": "in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, including nearly the entire mainroad, very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mazzer had been cleared under a big police battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are partly inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the quarter of the last years has become increasingly the Magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: with them there are now residents from the GDR-times and former housekeeping with the "Kiez."

<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rental period, which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you recognize them on the disks or freshly coated facades that were captured with exploited.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year together with the words "linksautonome violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason why not all neighbours this as a problem could not be aware that they are not impacted by the crime of crime: criminal offences like body violations, statistics show almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make nonfiction that tends to rebuild newbuilds and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, cannot be heard of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violent actions are they important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, those who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will leave it right in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, its street is not a criminal fuel, on the contrary: "here, one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the rigaer road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was also so important that people inhabit their road: from the police, politics and the media, who once in July all claimed the signing of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to go away: through the sluggless newbuilds in former building gaps, which penetrates the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that is, finally, condominiums that are not interesting for many here - more people living here, who are not so well entered," says it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I do absolutely eat."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do then, if anyone listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There will be frustration among all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For indrawn, which annoyed over colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the "Kiez"</seg>
<seg id="38">Everyone who moves you should be aware - just like any one that moves into a pubs which can make poorly complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, there are also internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants which need to be frozen or cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do-profit work - and the motivates and very neatly told, such as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">They hopes that the work for the joint venture leads to a positive result.</seg>
<seg id="34">This was "no employment therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">He does not mean work yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a seniority.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So the administration and honorary volunteer may also be paid here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they wish to be in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees that it takes and can be overcrowded the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever doesn't feel the feeling of evolution, he could not work in Urbach, will not work and be unprofitable to never integrate them.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority would be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases are, however, says customer honest, "people where nothing goes on." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "Mammuttask."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two most recent incidents in front of Radicalisation, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensibilly is the helper but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the perpetrators bring them completely into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Reine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main and honorary positions must be taken on site and in the region for activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new store for refugees and migrants to Urbach could come.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place it helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we are not there where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE customer also makes clear that the Urbacher was able to integrate the previous person in rational.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, these are around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women are one.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no ordinary answers.</seg>
