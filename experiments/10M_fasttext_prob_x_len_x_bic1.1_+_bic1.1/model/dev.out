Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just of use .
the two wanted to speak on the implementation of international agreement as well as in German measures for dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting it is said to have the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ ded for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of peace in the peace process .
through Obama &apos;s deal of an Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two continues deterior@@ ated .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held an disp@@ uted speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress in front of the US Congress , which was partly reported as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama .
the talk was not speaking with Obama , a meeting had opposed to the im@@ pending election of Israel .
in an emergency call is Professor to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon appeared to the police that he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that his servants would have to come to his house .
Lamb is important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; swe@@ eter &quot; but still alive and probably started up , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile .
within the house , the officers found the Lei@@ che of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note that appeared on a white block , I loved it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was by the authorities in the letter , and it was signed from Lamb .
there was no evidence that the Lamb that had entered in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , where he had already travelled 300 miles to the school area where he had shot and killed me according to the police on his office , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Eye , Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all @-@ workers ended the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he made the fat@@ eful emer@@ gen@@ cies sometime after that .
until the end of the day there was a further death : he took the life when the police arrested him .
one day after the shooting incident at the university , the students and do@@ z@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities always try to pro@@ cure a picture of what is motiv@@ ated .
those published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state published details , including what students and employees who knew him , helped me to draw a picture of an talented but probably difficult teachers .
students said they rejoiced in his teaching .
the police in auti@@ stic where she died , says he did not have a history of violence or a criminal act .
Schmidt himself had been mentioned in a book written in him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; in which he shared his academic life .
both mentioned in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose cur@@ ator has 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some tenden@@ cies to problem@@ atic behaviour .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ ars , who praised God , he said , he seemed to have somewhat excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes said it told him that he had told him to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
it first asked the Delta State University to have asked for lack of health reasons and thus said that he had any health problem .
in this year he set only two online courses .
some recent changes in employment policy of the University found that the promotion for which the Lamb had so hard worked for him , no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as assistant professor .
University of William , he said , he wi@@ ped nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but , of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ination Principal . &quot;
these are questions that cannot be sent anymore .
after the escape from the Campus , the police later found Laz@@ bs track as he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; outskirts on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that it believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb opened in 2009 at the university , the 3,@@ 500 university students in a town with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in spring in education .
one of the long @-@ term friends Lam@@ bert called him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said that she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older Ker@@ l , who tried some years to teach the guitar play .
he was then the s@@ warm of women .
all girls are melted because he was there , said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 , and the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss obviously came some time together .
the emergency call &quot; I said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the baking stone house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in bo@@ aters .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ab@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were left 15 years ago , but friends remained and one daughter had now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Get over his daughter .
her and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing .
Lamb before he came from there , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago , both at a summer school market .
later they played together one or another .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ er said , his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse that worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak light bar close by the auti@@ er , said that he was Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night in the night 5 september for the last time , after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ as@@ ive from a poor audience .
there was no evidence for something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were listening and cre@@ denti@@ sts on each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense for kid@@ ze .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .

the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .

8 comp@@ resses values that indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the top speed to surveys using it ( still ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys had run Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to investigate , what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was delivered to the S@@ wan Herman Cain , none of which he won only a state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recogni@@ z@@ able rub@@ bing al@@ um@@ ps and begin to flow up their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current poll@@ ing values indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
rub@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular pollut@@ ants have turned 180 degrees to 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans met the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep up in early countries .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ Elec@@ tor GO@@ P were happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would either &apos; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , which would say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in seeing enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ation , would be candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans see not as a problem by the tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament .
while Donald Tr@@ ump , widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bed and subsequent statements , 52 percent of people participate in rep@@ ublic@@ s voters think that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul says the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first subur@@ ban of State , State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a ruler , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent say that he didn &apos;t have the personality to perform effective immediately , and nearly six out of 10 un@@ dependent claims that his tem@@ per is not into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters being acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
if they set up their hil@@ ly , republi@@ can voters think Tr@@ ump become real .
if question@@ ed who wins the GO@@ P @-@ nom@@ ination , will say , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the previous week four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four of ten &apos;s of July their money came to J@@ eb Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est of the crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle there was four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination over just 28 % for the final candidate , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ turn@@ around Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign will show the campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered another candidates , Tr@@ ump recommends nearly everyone .
some experts prove that the sh@@ atter@@ proof box probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps Leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support to diff@@ us is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , lac@@ tic , multiple support harvest@@ ed .
he had ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points advantage , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son is responsible for the entrepren@@ eurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a nearly majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans claims that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have issued their voices .
of course you can do much to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said that they can open the door to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful competition at the moment of the other external lateral , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors they say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump into the Them@@ e of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign in front of two months immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration and pi@@ v@@ ot point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the atomic fact of Tr@@ ump @-@ His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and re@@ charge the re@@ orientation efforts .
however , according to the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans that they agree with fac@@ ial questions of immigration .
as long as immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it will also do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration among the government climbed up to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son sub@@ mits about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly through its out@@ sider status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ s say in the new Mont@@ ags behind by ABC / Post , they prefer a more political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are too angry for Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa - two weeks ago show that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans over Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied , &quot; and 21 percent &quot; recur@@ sively . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential cars
here in the Hob@@ ah road there is the most expensive residential community - with views over the North Sea .
in the street there is a square meter of a reproduction house with an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; based on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is limited , &quot; i.e. , in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special layers cost one square metre .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a students in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ residence , one of the price comes as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate company Engel &amp; Fo@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square prices in sw@@ elling high places .
there are several tenth Euro somewhere - per square meter , to be noticed .
but good , who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is as an exception : not at the top .

Mu@@ eller received the Champions League at his 28th hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had to pass one of the sk@@ ill@@ ings of the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; had organised Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without shine .
Pi@@ raeus founded his youngest six hom@@ e@@ games in the p@@ inn@@ acle class , including prominent clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , too , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 )
but the Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els , was defeated by Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they had to bra@@ ve bra@@ ve , with their offensive effort but often too hard to work .
the attacks were often led by the player on the left side of Douglas Costa , who rarely died in the previous brown @-@ welded Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Mu@@ eller had more than@@ k@@ ful of right when his flan@@ k went down in the left upper chamber on the left side of the gorge .

although the Bayern lived with a dominant feature , Pir@@ ve has made a needle &apos;s needle .

as a result , it was a shot of ide@@ ye to the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to New York , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a quarter with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Go@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat at first outside .
just after the final training of the world , he was named Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , it is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola committed against him when he raised the King@@ sley Com@@ an for the nom@@ inees Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ 1 ) .
it was too late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and later made it all clear , by El@@ f@@ ton Müller made a dr@@ on .

those who smoke , do not only the lung , but also the teeth - this impos@@ es a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of incidence , the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a much increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is known from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ GO@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking consumers the risk of smo@@ kers should be pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to lose the 2.5 @-@ to 3.6 @-@ fold .

not to be clari@@ fied , what extent is smoking also increased the risk of car@@ ies .
people who listen closely with smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research . &quot;

the European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system via the targeted trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversial private light @-@ safety devices for disp@@ utes between the companies and the states are therefore replaced by a more transparent system that meets considerably more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; we want to establish a system that trust the citizen , &quot; said Commissioner to European Commissioner for Cec@@ ilia Con@@ ström when introducing .
the Swe@@ din asked to launch the European negoti@@ ating position as a European negoti@@ ating position with the USA .
the German Government announced support .
TT@@ IP is to be the largest free trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings were described , that the EU states and the U.S. will choose independent judges for a new investment property .
they are supposed to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and the third countries .
the second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to lift up the burden .
to date , the process took together among the refer@@ ee , and the claim against their sentences .
in the discussion of last months it became clear that citizens were not familiar with the old IS@@ DS systems in matters of Fair@@ ness and Justice .
in the long term , they will be able to work for an International Investment Court in the long term .
there may be any disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and the EU states there , too .
the Invest@@ or Global Framework Programme ( IS@@ DS ) will be regarded as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ es are critic@@ ized by opponents as a kind of parallel tuning , which extend the t@@ ooth@@ ies of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national legislation , or decrease consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act discussed the proposal of the European Commission as in@@ sufficient .
it is primarily critical that they are not valid for negoti@@ ated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German state Secretary General Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) distinguished the plans by contrast to strong progress .
the Commission Con@@ sider the reform of significant points , the Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel acquired in the spring with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ es shall be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of real estate .
the European Business Association Business Europe continued to restri@@ ct the business opportunities in business by many new rules .
especially small and medium enterprises could be prevented by this , it was called .
when discussions on the Free Trade Agreement , TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) will continue to be un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , subject area protection has been discussed so far not with the USA .
originally , a framework for the agreement was planned for the end of this year .
this appointment is considered no longer available .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has made the premi@@ er of the Prime Minister &apos;s freight con@@ sign@@ ment .
the new Labour President Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n began his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s freight for@@ wards and dedic@@ ating David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is lifted up for the first of its six given questions facing south , with what the performance of the media is probably checked and the Labour MEP &apos;s proposal .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because she is due to become a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett and his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Chairman announced on Tuesday during the Battle of Britain on the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , pointed out by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and stands in the centre of several cover pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to sing the National An@@ them , has drawn attention to himself
a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he had stood in respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; and was recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the famous Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour Chairman to sing the National An@@ them to sing , &quot; independent of his faith that the mon@@ archy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leaders , and they are called to differences in economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements are also in Labour &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns to the European Union and the limitation of threads .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , showing Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ employment and polit@@ ician ministers said that the Party is very clear that it is only against the government plans to lower the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the fifth Labour president David Cameron , ever since his T@@ ory CEO ever since he is over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament , over the last decade .
the Labour president , who promised a different policies for politics , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ate , and that he is able to refra@@ in both &quot; impact strength , &quot; and spreading out problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic designer is represented by him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation with other colleagues in occasion to take the word , and that he John Ber@@ ber , spokes@@ man of the house , talked to er@@ ect the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he had linked himself from the policy in the style of a &quot; Casino Theatre &quot; which is often associated with fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he dre@@ amed he wants to make it in it .
since it was first aired on TV in 1990 , the Prime Minister and his leadership was considered the most important Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in his leadership , although critics argu@@ ed to ar@@ gue that she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require widespread reforms .

between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the same year .
the percentage was the fastest and posted in@@ estim@@ ations over the time of an interest increase since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 505 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .

the cost could meet the Expan@@ sion@@ ist plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

Met@@ cash starts the bottom @-@ life campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
Met@@ one tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di San &quot; walk in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers &quot; Met@@ rac has launched an obj@@ ection campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a $ 700 million Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di is the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthening and IG@@ A markets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing of the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A De@@ al@@ ers and suppliers go off board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ man Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop @-@ owner , which sell tickets for the South Australian football League at lo@@ yal customer .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be publishing further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and equipment runs its annual Invest@@ ors &apos; Day .
it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ stores accounts and higher profit mar@@ gins established as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
proc@@ urement managers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts believe as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening of his first markets , around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all existing nu@@ is@@ ers , but mainly that of those retailers can take sales .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath published by Morgan Stanley , that IG@@ A retailers could save $ 360 million in revenue per year and to save $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predi@@ ction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di will reach 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery stores and the amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s at a high fixed base might cost about $ 13 million in cash before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ al@@ locate &apos;s market share in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the best .
Morgan Stanley particip@@ ates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and grocery market will increase by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , was that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within the decade .
Met@@ rac refused to react to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member has taken contact with Mr Dou@@ glass this week &apos;s last week .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and supplies from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which has been around 1,200 percent , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , refle@@ cting the operative debt reduction in revenues and mar@@ gins .
however , the bulk shipping sector enters , however , investing more than $ 150 million , to improve selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve their shops through faster growing fresh food and provide better choice of private Label food products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop rehabilitation programs are hop@@ ed and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to earnings growth in four years for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ i is supported by the President of the Australian tennis society Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Co@@ y@@ ak@@ is earns her praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Than@@ si co@@ al@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ alism &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick He@@ ath and deser@@ ves after the view of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise the cr@@ iti@@ que for his own behaviour .
co@@ co@@ ach@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which will always be referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; by the inf@@ am@@ ous meditation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters at the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , co@@ al@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated from the arbit@@ rators , whereby Har@@ rison had to strike with Har@@ rison : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA had to beat the child , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he had a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f had failed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , the co@@ al@@ ak@@ is was defended by Heal@@ y von Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals .
... &quot; one thing , which I rather en@@ vi@@ ate me , is the fact that after my opinion of Than@@ asi a little was entered in the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he has broken up a bat when he lost a cr@@ amp@@ on in the US Open , but it is not the first player who has a bat of fru@@ stration with itself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , indeed , it &apos;s extremely well @-@ doing in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ve many recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think it was very little too strict .
he is a very rei@@ fer 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he will never fit any problem with the other players , he has trained tough , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it , after its own service .
Heal@@ y supported the decision to take into account the important decision that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term @-@ lasting part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ um &#91; Kyr@@ r &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I think that Nick has drawn very fast the climb , what people have done as fe@@ ar@@ er and mur@@ ray , and deser@@ ve all the criticism that he gets , but we try to understand him the consequences of his work , in which he could only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team , and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , continues refugees
Hungary declared the Not@@ with@@ standing and un@@ locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to come illegal in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials .
the people who have fled before violence to an unknown period in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went on .
as a police helicopter on them swe@@ pt over them , the Mig@@ rants &apos; opening the border ! &quot; and cried out against the Hungarian power @-@ polic@@ eman .
some were exp@@ elled from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it to be &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that immig@@ rants would be sent back from Hungary , during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and it does not harm a coll@@ ateral .
discussions and other countries will have to take place in Brussels and other countries , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian @-@ Serb border reached one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a cont@@ ingent meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would have more than 120,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union to discuss the in@@ flow crisis in the continent .
Hungary , however , hopes that its hopes for a bal@@ ancing action of Brussels or from its neigh@@ bors .
the emergency that was called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave a more power to awareness of the crisis , so that they could accelerate streets and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country has also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it concluded a fence at the Serbian Border .
in fact , C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even in@@ car@@ cases during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence manufactured between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the past months Hungary has become a lot of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck and the entrance to the European Union .
Prime Minister Vik@@ tor Or@@ ban came to in@@ sist@@ ed that most an@@ gled economic refugees , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high Za@@ us who led the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws apply higher legal pen@@ alties for the tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; due to the situation that emerged from the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said Governance Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament must still agree with the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porter from Associated Press have seen on the limit of heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already tag@@ on .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come about by playing the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are involved , to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials conducted two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday after a train d@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the bound@@ aries .
chaos hosted the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians joined a small office in a metal container to handle data from people , and cr@@ ushed a human amount in order to hin@@ ge them there .
around 20 succeeded in attendance but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants lost the most important highway compound from Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse to spend food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head had hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former State Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton held a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic races at the nom@@ ination of national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win their opposite to floor .
Clinton now got the support of 47 percent of democratic voters during the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent previously ) while S@@ anders stands at second , with 27 percent increase ( 17 percent rise ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet announced whether he was allowed for the presidential Office , support 15 percent of the democratic voters of the sel@@ ections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , which candidates will support them .
however , Clin@@ t Supp@@ or@@ ers are independent in their choice as those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey Clinton has lost Clinton in a series of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profit .
Clinton holds a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these pre@@ ch@@ iefs have decreased .
their support for the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is just 5 points back here .
Clin@@ t Adv@@ ant@@ ages in democratic voters under 50 years of age , and her and S@@ anders are now on equal height .
Clinton had a great advantage over the older elec@@ tors .
last month , Clinton had been with a two @-@ digit advantage over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders does now have a 5 @-@ point lead to this group .
about half of democratic voters think about half of democratic elec@@ toral elections say that they were nominated to enthusiasm , when it was nominated by the party .
one quarter would support her with some demonstration , and another 15 percent would only support them , because they are the candidate for the Candi@@ date .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ics current supporters are enthusi@@ astic about her .
views are strongly mixed with those who do not support Clinton - only about one quarter it would love them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters think that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters think this would say to Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
when Clin@@ t Supp@@ or@@ ters ask in an open question , why they want that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time to be a woman President ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the greatest candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ t Supp@@ or@@ ters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is mentioned .
consent to use with problems and elec@@ torate has also been cited .
as the Vice President marked the Presidency for the presidential elec@@ toral body , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes it should not do it .
if democratic voters will be asked for elections , who would be a second choice for the party , bi@@ ds at the top .
from Clin@@ ics App@@ endi@@ ces more than half , bi@@ ds would be the second choice in front of S@@ anders .
the Bi@@ den decides , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head start at S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters want to see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning choice , but the number of 78 per cent in the last month dropped .
bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage , who sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; list .
nevertheless , in the question of what candidates are important , the voters call for a Democratic Vot@@ ers of voters .
similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate has been un@@ acceptable for those sel@@ ections .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in voters of the pre@@ sidents of their party .
Multi@@ oms needs Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy and are equipped with strong guide qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts best for the three candidates in respect of hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty per cent of democratic voters think that Clinton are hon@@ est@@ ly and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
the Ele@@ ction of the Pre @-@ Ele@@ ctions in general also resem@@ bles Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ology in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , roughly a quarter of democratic voters will have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clinton used to use a personal E @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an Foreign Minister , most significant voters are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the amer@@ ican public .
half of the Americans now is not satisfied with their explanation , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion this was in March , shortly after the problem was brought to light .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail account has no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their thoughts were still wor@@ sen@@ ed .
there are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
even though Clinton &apos;s cont@@ est@@ ly be considered hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this remains a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent are seen as hon@@ est@@ ly and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters think they do not hold a hon@@ our@@ able and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote now also Tr@@ ump , not tru@@ st@@ worthy and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however receive good notes on the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush , best in respect of hon@@ esty .
a majority see S@@ anders rather than hon@@ est@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son back@@ ward behind Donald Tr@@ ump on the country
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters cancelled more than half of the voters in the new survey , and others have to fall dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters can still support tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l which was conducted before Fox News debate in the previous month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son increased from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son climbed well to demo@@ graphic groups and tr@@ ump of Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ i , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , which is very well fallen , and by 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Govern@@ or , J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 376 people from Rep@@ ublic@@ s in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s to the poll@@ s - he lan@@ det at 19 % support from Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
at a glance at a very last week rising Car@@ son Tr@@ ump visited some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son decided to ap@@ ologi@@ ze to the question of Tr@@ um@@ ps .

pleasant bathroom temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if maximum values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is already mentioned in the Mediterranean to take care of hot water .
a swim in the North or Baltic Sea should be fun with a maximum of 17 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College
nearly two years after a student in a ch@@ ic@@ onic rit@@ ual when a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ aid compl@@ ain against five people .
members of the New York Baruch College P@@ i @-@ del@@ i bro@@ therhood &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g took up brutal attacks in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which has contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been exposed with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand ; and repeatedly he was attacked , while he was trying to go through a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g mour@@ ned over head@@ aches , then he dropped to un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ del@@ ta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g died and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police arrested .
however , they had the time to switch to d@@ eng@@ s , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the National President of the Brotherhood , to inv@@ ade advice , retri@@ eved the police , Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the group began to hide and exhibited the very good of the Brotherhood , in principle over the &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police lock .
he couldn &apos;t be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ si@@ ze@@ al report Den@@ g were repeated with a t@@ amp@@ per force at his head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the tre@@ ads of the Brotherhood . at least one student a year since 1970 , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in a declaration .
fra@@ ctions and its members have to be taken into account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe felt the accus@@ ation of murder for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with sp@@ ik@@ y attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this we will also refer to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Baruch College had banned the bro@@ therhood and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation back to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest
an interest rate is coming , and the house continues to be refu@@ elled , yields , yields for bonds , and the economy will lead in a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long will this take and how long it will stick .
especially the history of the economy has only slight guidance on the procedure .
a recession was raised within just 11 months after the first interest increase and lasted 86 months .
the Ag@@ gressive of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor of how the economy and financial assets react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank , so viol@@ ently emphas@@ ises that investors should not focus on interest rates when they start to increase interest rates , but rather to the period which is needed for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants , however , real@@ ise that the whole exc@@ itement is probably ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of an interest rate .
&quot; the first increase of F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; budget money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication of customers .
in contrast , we don &apos;t expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level , to the seism@@ ic shock , which seem to fear a lot .
however , this doesn &apos;t mean that there will be no impact .
here is a glance at historic trends based on how some areas of economy might react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest @-@ rate things can take for a while .
once the increase arrived , the influence is not as a dramatic .
&quot; there &apos;s apparently a tendency to decrease assets 12 to 24 months after the first order , what might happen again the delay in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct in a recent study what is happening after the interest rate of F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is mostly spoken in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average return on Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the ten@@ ds ten@@ ds to occur later in the increase cycle and the return rate begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates promote them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some terms that could not be higher and accelerate the recession .
very remarkable is that the Gross Dom@@ estic Product is in the vicinity of its lowest point for an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 percent of the total nominal GDP has only stood twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few figures expect it will expect to be expected to grow by only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest rate in one so frag@@ ile economic scenery could be ris@@ ky and submit the question , &quot; whether this is no other way , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year at a rate hike in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists believe and econom@@ ists believe FO@@ MC might be an increase in this meeting , the Fut@@ ures Trading provides just an increase of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the processing cycles from 1950 till today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing weak@@ ening to the GDP and placed on @-@ rec@@ ession@@ aire as fast after the start of recovery in the shade . &quot;
contrary to this , this is a clear recovery of what is the worst recession in the observ@@ ational phase .
the current cycle is quite the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income became even vol@@ ati@@ l as the market takes a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to be changing in the cycle , as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle .
at the end of the rise , the bond yields immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to close to longer and shorter bonds and leads to a down@@ turn of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , even though &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come analy@@ st at sw@@ ab , in an analysis .
what &apos;s interesting , Jones , proved that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest have gone on , the mit@@ ig@@ ur@@ ve is flat , lending activities increased , and the Vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed has tigh@@ tened their strategy .
in the big and entire company , we will pay off the larger part of their business activities in the US , including interest rates , and more attractive products .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debts are worse due to increasing their products on the global market , and as well as financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; Quality - &quot; shares ten@@ ds to react , three months after an initial interest rate , Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ anal@@ ysts said in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet companies in the previous year were exceeded by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate investments in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
company with high capital yields , as well as low flo@@ at@@ ility at their shares , also exceeded their counter@@ parts by an average rating of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) on average .
debts are a big issue .
company with a high share of flexible interest is most lose , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure equity games , consumers are also benef@@ ited from the increasing dollar .
savings could see profits through higher income , even if professionals are in different opinion how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says member of the parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
the Con@@ serv@@ atives Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he increasingly is increasingly different from commercial rec@@ val@@ ents .
he also contributed to the BBC Music Awards and told them only The Br@@ its im@@ ited
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins with the vote The Voice , saying that this is not very original .
the BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts to Classic FM , a leader in parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it does not doing something that will not do the private broadcast@@ ers .
the Con@@ serv@@ atives Chamber of Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public broad@@ caster &quot; ver@@ stup@@ id &quot; and increasingly does not differ from its commercial compet@@ itor .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m not like to turn the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , started in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year seem to be &quot; Br@@ its only in a different name . &quot;
so , if you try to do something different - this are two spontan@@ e@@ ously mentioned examples , where you &apos;re actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC general director pointed out the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 fly far ahead of its commercial compet@@ itor when there are around Live music and En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , that will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of radio 3 , new music will find and new works in order to give I also really important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey claimed that harder it had to work to eng@@ age the audience as it did in the past , because the British are fewer on classical music .
radio 3 was however not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing held in the Committee for the Selection of Culture , Media and Sports was under fire , into commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ Members of Dam@@ ien Collins away The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media , for an estimated cost of $ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall indicated that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on special BBC @-@ mode .
he added , he wishes notice that the company will find &quot; a hit from our house &apos;s own stable &quot; when it st@@ alls the next time .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further rows of The Voice in the future , or to give money from the pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August in the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the records began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones by using mobile phone
experts believe that the Black Friday slow@@ ed in November at the November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is bo@@ oted , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into cl@@ ut@@ ters .
but experts say that there are now evidence that online sales were stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that online sales were stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures show up only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for years to come back to 2000 , &quot; following the time it has always developed , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sale index .
he declared that the online sales increased over three years ago , when the buyer had driven to make purchases to it with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ enters itself , and perhaps we will experience that growth is di@@ min@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the follow @-@ up sales .
experts believe that buyers will last returning to their purchases on Friday , November last Friday .
last year it spar@@ ked five times the average number of buyers around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer sites have collap@@ sed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer f@@ ails to fight for bar@@ gain , buyers can adapt to buyers .
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 was spent .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases on web @-@ shops are carried out .
at the same time buys more than a quarter of man clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion dec@@ am in the suburbs .

officials of A@@ I / D@@ ue to un@@ faith@@ fully for judgment
the Provin@@ cial Court of Klagenfurt have participated in the Wednesday two functioning of the Austrian Volleyball championship A@@ I / D@@ ue to un@@ faith@@ fully and output education .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them had also been indicted for abuse of abuse .
he was acquitted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Chief Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel detected in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants were allowed in 2006 to 2011 by founding members , for which they were allowed in their functions for private purposes .
he has been al@@ ert the damage with around 400,000 euros .
sports forces are also charged because of financial statements .
this fact expired the Chair@@ woman of the District Court , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it is said to be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
at the time of mis@@ creating the defence , the defence asked that the association was not part of a property in any time .
the sport @-@ operative could only have been calcul@@ ating and the sports club for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had a lot of time and money , in 2001 , the liabilities were approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ ,000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : &quot; we run the club on or locked up we ? , &quot; said one of the accused , a professional spray on the financial district .
with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money in hand to put off our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said .
with the association it has been agreed : you can centrally manage the money , only no debts are allowed .
furthermore , in the corresponding financial financial , the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the damage compensation was agreed retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , a part of the wall damages endu@@ red only years later , namely , since 2003 , when a plus was on account to be paid out .
therefore , all the l@@ ump sum and not detail reviews , the former ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savings were administered by the two accused , telling the second def@@ endants .
why the withdraw@@ als of the association are not published in detail , asked the judge .
the Association has not been interested in detail for the financial situation , so important is the debt of school@@ ing , so the answer .
in 2011 , when an Invest@@ igation began to use the authorities , an amount of 120,000 euros was sent to the account .
the def@@ endants were review , explained the accused .
this securities account ran in the name of the second accused , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge .
and the Be@@ ing didn &apos;t know any answer .
then he meant that he was believed that this is the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have felt anything of this money , the prosecutor was in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants had been informed , just@@ i@@ fying the func@@ tionary .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims for repar@@ ation . &quot;
why cont@@ amin@@ ant ? , wanted to know judge and prosecutor .
it stated that the first def@@ endant , he was not yet agree with this formulation , because the association was never damaged .
but what shall I do if the lawyer said , &quot; You are all of you out of the Schneider . &quot;
&quot; have I been a lawyer ? , &quot; he asked .
in addition , the officials said , He has never settled a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he placed the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , added .
exact documents for the early years could not stop def@@ endants .
these may be judged according to an operational exam in which everything was judged correctly , and have not been kept any more kept .
the second accused also had the second accused .
all Beh@@ avi@@ es are in cash , with which he has to leave from his residence to the Bank of Dep@@ res@@ burg , he stated in his testimony .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

the Hungarian police have used the Hungarian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water c@@ ann@@ ons against several hundred re@@ eds .
Eur@@ on@@ ews &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the non@@ violence at border controls .
he reported to us :
a group of refugees forced the border .
behind him there was a polic@@ emen tro@@ op and behind the polic@@ emen stood a tr@@ am@@ eth@@ rower .
40 to 50 refugees started to throw stone blocks and plastic bottles after the civil servants .
but the officials initially consisted of pep@@ per@@ spray .
after that the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
plenty of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as has been spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was dis@@ band@@ ed .
the refugees have already been des@@ per@@ ately withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently last woman was carried away from the zone .
children that had min@@ ate the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees screw@@ ed together and had worked for breath conditions .
the pre@@ ferences of the Serbian police have suffered in injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and pep@@ per@@ il .
time of decision on interest rates for the US music bank
the world ob@@ serves , when the US @-@ sheet music is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be lifted or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ viewed by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed would do this last week , now th@@ inks that the F@@ ed is still waiting to wait any longer and the interest rates will hold at this present level of 0 - 0.25 per cent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years ago , since the F@@ ed has put an interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank can leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , head staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ ving outlook for global conditions .
it warned the markets to stop an increase , but the signs suggest that chances against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
ob@@ sc@@ orer at the Delta State University det@@ un@@ ed compensation
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he later shot at his colleague , he wrote Sh@@ annon wick@@ a notice that he would be &quot; sorry for the first murder and wanted to make &quot; he could never happen to happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police at G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that he is a lecturer of ge@@ ography and social education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and he said that he was shot on someone and killed anyone .
he says that the staff of the emergency call indicates that police officers must send them to his home .
he said &quot; I missed my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but he is never bo@@ ther@@ ed , but probably more excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t gave him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police came on the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten notebook from Lamb , 45 , said , &quot; I &apos;m so tired , I could guess it could be revers@@ ed .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , it came to Delta State University 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when they defeated him .
University of William , he said , he wi@@ ped nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but , of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ ination Principal . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday that had supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ab@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities called on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &apos; Tri@@ ec@@ ks@@ relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good human being &quot; was described .
the two were vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ er said , he and Pr@@ ab@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ab@@ iss had their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss went online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that she had a dog called Light@@ ning that met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , Lamb is calling for a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he would not go in prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen reached him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , then it pulled his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killing himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 he received a PhD from the Delta State University and a PhD in his Doc@@ trine of the University .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a major group construction .
in the year , Lufthansa will save a half billion euros alone with a better organization .

with the pilot phase there is nothing in the new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds its business structure and evalu@@ ates the appro@@ g@@ ary Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the real@@ ignment is the goal of a contribution to approx . € 500 million per year from cost @-@ earnings and earnings , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no more executive board for Lufthansa in the future .
the low @-@ fare line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as such as possible .
in the Executive Board of Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Managing Director Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
in Luke Sha@@ w , at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , the dual structure of its rights was lost .
while this left the le@@ ft@@ ist personality to the weeping and un@@ lock it for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal does not hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a review of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was incorporated in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought into hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg , and is in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow , he will be moved one day later , and then in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then that happens , and then that happens .
in the dressing cabin , he had a oxygen layer .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double structure , then it will last six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season back again .
Mor@@ eno appeared quite happy to be a red card and a suspension of a cub@@ ator .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the sole arbit@@ rator , has not pen@@ alised the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mis@@ si@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a key to Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe , how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back again . &quot;
as a result : Manchester United has been suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
the British Defender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover from the European Championship in France until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ trainer , said : &quot; it is a very severe injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the space of breach , all very sad are sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a stop in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands @-@ Team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he &apos;s really hard , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who tou@@ ches him in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels like it feels like that .
I feel very bad for me . I &apos;m sorry for so much .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was brought to the hospital also in the hospital - after a shoul@@ ders of Chris Sm@@ yr@@ um .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax do better ?
it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know it almost .
it &apos;s because you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book chose the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , which was founded in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and goes on : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , since it seems to be an image or a message that we have missed . &quot;
all well and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead , a description of the movie version of 2012 shows the new characters and details added to enlarge the fairly short original text .
&quot; surrounded by the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature breaks , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y by winning a real tree , &quot; read it . a love aff@@ old was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ el who died in 1991 but completely unknown .
as if the text wasn &apos;t enough : the text contained by Cameron is partially appearing on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hop@@ ing a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
though he likes to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is familiar to the hand of the book so little . here , an un@@ w@@ ann@@ ess boy , like the local environment through the cov@@ ite Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ur@@ ging , ch@@ ur@@ ious , &quot; which is made in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR assignment was deleg@@ ated to an assistant , The Lor@@ ax didn &apos;t read 20 times in a row in a child .
one Dow@@ ning Street speaking spokes@@ woman said that the text could probably be from Camer@@ oon &apos;s elec@@ toral office .
Super@@ vi@@ a@@ Camp confirmed that the text of Camer@@ oon &apos;s staff was given , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from English Team , but it still remains hard
when Pakistan met in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the cad@@ re that has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I wouldn &apos;t close a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Website is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin player in Batt@@ ling @-@ list , and the common is strong ; they will not bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
the ball develops Mo@@ ques Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
this means that Adam Ly@@ th divi@@ des from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that crime players are oriented to results .
there was no fra@@ ction at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - that players are their own best choice .
long ago , we had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own fate .
if hop@@ efully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , a further chance will come .
the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ bite praised his attitude , even if he did not have such good performance , and it surprised me not ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test @-@ b@@ ats@@ man receives to translate his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got him - when he got Nick Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton had the chance to return home and down@@ wards .
the only repro@@ aches that can be lifted out in the Caribbean at first time - when Ly@@ th arrived in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es come in , and he is a k@@ iller that I guess about .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket players , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire in the early season , when he had 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what we met .
he must collect at least the same chances of winning it , but this depends of course of cre@@ w@@ ells in the United Arab Emirates .
as next to Cook , the idea to bring an extra spin Bow@@ ler and four qu@@ ests would flash , and I have nothing about it .
I do not see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there , and on that left hand has already shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ie von Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ ques did not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s no number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 .
he had made three hundred p@@ uns immediately and did not cancel .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited way he impressed me very impressed with a young man .
people may see its statistics levels - on average 31 with the bat and 35 using the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is not a large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who hold their hands and the coach have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot at this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , became an advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the most n@@ ett@@ ish not@@ ices of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences since he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful application in the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as a Coach , and as Mah@@ ela hasn &apos;t seen in@@ sights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be used in the dressing cabin ref@@ resh , even if the news in line with the previously said .
coll@@ ies team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team controllers do not determine the ti@@ met@@ able .
and you must remember that , in the players don &apos;t exp@@ ire their jobs from the results .
such decisions will not be affected by light .
Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ bound Great Britain from the EU ) could amount to Zul@@ u if the economy is dist@@ ressed in 2017
David Cameron in@@ con@@ fin@@ ed new negoti@@ ator strategy to hold the UK in the EU , even without the election of genuine Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who rode on Tuesday because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners got their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ er said that some member states , as deeply dist@@ anced in various cr@@ ises , as the EU is now once and not always formed from their own debt , Great Britain themselves , and dis@@ close the changes that they are mostly not to be satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it is not able to end@@ anger the social protection .
also we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister cli@@ sts on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it always goes around me .
my European friend , who wishes you looking for outside the UK inside the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let us not see us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more sum@@ c@@ ous ministers and civil servants come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or going on .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Chancellor Angela Merkel has been an allies since 10 years before it looks good for them , as it looks bad for them , such as those who do not do for them , such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ az@@ ing force .
Poland is likely to have a national@@ ist government in Spain , in Spain .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are b@@ lowing a bun@@ ch to avoid the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy would not be better to prevent the Austr@@ o @-@ British from the UK - something that they do not want to have most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
therefore some such ministers may do not even inten@@ tionally be helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , projected my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how about the Fle@@ et Street can be on its costs and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the ac@@ gar@@ ch@@ ie of the press bar@@ one , as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired by the speaker in 1975 , but was not supported by our entry in 1973 with a 2 : 1 ratio .
they could possibly remember Boris Johnson , the copper Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist , who made himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas &apos; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
at all his dec@@ eption , Ed mil@@ i@@ band came up , who were his enemies .
this was the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ sk@@ ating barri@@ ers , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ inc@@ ers , who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air was similar to them , but he noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one is better ban@@ anas in order to give it instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band &apos;s more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans was reflected as the Bl@@ air himself , because Bl@@ air had surrendered to the referendum , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , which opened to him a back@@ door .
the press has never done it to him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n that was on Monday in Westminster gave a friendly can@@ ola on the back - I told him that he would not need any time for me to repeat the boy@@ cot@@ t boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ ten &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but it must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I pres@@ sions it friendly - in development .
it says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ye numbers and the wil@@ ts fil@@ tering of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can certainly be saying Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but did not have Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n im Radio and television this week , did not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the inc@@ ision by John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow @-@ Chancellor , a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father died on TV because he had ende@@ av@@ oured to be lo@@ yal to his Labour cabin @-@ mates , without going to go any way and to shed his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under any circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ ns comments - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C had his competitors and members after all reports on Monday evening .
what do I want to mediate the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n , remember that he even ag@@ it@@ ated - News @-@ discipl@@ ines remain important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron &apos;s free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep check@@ over support in the refer@@ end@@ al struggle for a self @-@ understanding , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental multi @-@ meaning to the EU membership - in line with its Ben@@ n@@ ite Belgian Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ ting discussion under the left dis@@ sidents who is a central base of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its multiple agreements for NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is confident that J@@ C will not take a campaign to withdrawal - will foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find at home in all , for their su@@ peri@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin have become political action - they also have mis@@ sil@@ ly voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when it can be po@@ int@@ less ?
the US have already dis@@ appointed quite dis@@ appo@@ inting from the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government on the power where I was slightly remin@@ is@@ cent of what was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts optim@@ ise report by public Health England via E @-@ cigarettes
the subject of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking was originated from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researcher .
experts who write the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et started to critic@@ ise the reports of the public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
he published the &quot; basic report of &quot; last month , and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have put the load capacity of the data and sent to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the journal Lanc@@ et published last month , the &quot; extraordinary &quot; basis &quot; that he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write BM@@ J and asked if the claims are &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Relations at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Ep@@ idemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health means that strategies should be based on the effectiveness of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the general public estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi@@ purpose decision @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ C@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor from the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco agent ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also taught the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , which said they .
one of the 12 participants on the meeting was declared to receive means of a e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the financing which he report@@ edly receive Philip Morris International from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which are also able to specify a sector funding in paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
in the meeting the tobacco line of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
the research project of the group &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
none of these links or limitations in the P@@ it report is discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there is no evidence that &quot; there is no evidence &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are considered a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of Health and well@@ being at P@@ ur , said that BM@@ J claims that the claim had been re@@ acted before@@ hand .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers die in his view@@ point .
all the evidence suggests that the health Ris@@ ks of E @-@ cigarettes are compar@@ atively low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
he has assigned the unique obligation to the information of the public about what is proof of and what is not , especially when it gives so much public confusion about the relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die annually at a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National health system € 2 bn per year .
by the clear advantages of current evidence , that e @-@ cigarettes are not risk of risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we meet our national competence .
BBC should open the East@@ man , former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , has said the BBC to stop , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fees should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
as soon as he critic@@ ized the BBC , it publicly critic@@ ized the BBC that it was likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard cont@@ est@@ ing time window against the most popular Shows of Their Ri@@ vals , and of transmitters in BB@@ C4 as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in contact with BBC 4 in his time for Channel 4 in his time .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs in order or sends out that BBC programs would be shown clearly from sub@@ sid@@ y ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the sky@@ scra@@ ping committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you would like to hold the radio fees what I do medium or long term do not get for a good idea , you should at least do the production at least on programs that do not do or put on job .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a possible broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs is financed , which could be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , and dis@@ able both @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I ende@@ av@@ our to see how that public TV should be public .
I don &apos;t think this would decrease the BBC at all .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will be on the hunt for evaluations , &quot; for the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the most popular programs of the BBC will give this again , what was the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ ise presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ er@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the previously publicly @-@ legal agen@@ ic programs &quot; could go to BB@@ C4 , but they carry out their tasks , and they can ar@@ gue that if they have seen in their apparent missions to just@@ ify the just@@ ification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ serving programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put it in a window of time , in which nobody wanted to see them ever .
comm@@ enting on the committee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions that can get the best value .
of course , you think all of course , that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask myself if this is right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who had also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC will review on their te@@ th@@ ian mission to create and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education , he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio ; and it should change this to publicly @-@ legal television transmitters in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be aired , and with the commercial transmit alli@@ ances will be available to make all online available .
&apos;@@ at@@ e@@ Genetics &apos; can control brain cell by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with a genet@@ ically altered nervous system that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes are changing the direction at the moment , in which they have a sound im@@ pulse , which are to be heard for the human ear , radi@@ ated .
the im@@ pulses are caused by switching the m@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that are genet@@ ically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that react to ultr@@ al@@ waves .
more about this topic : researchers reading and write brain activity with light
the researchers reported that the wor@@ ms show the power of a new method , called Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics , in which ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica &apos;s massacre J@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of cran@@ ial stimulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive process that decl@@ ines electrical im@@ pulses in the brain for treating symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
they usually react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ al@@ waves , which are then penet@@ rating into dig@@ s .
the reinforced ultr@@ asound heads work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ icon channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ mer@@ ry cells .
the sound waves prop@@ els the opening of these icons and activate the cells , which are allocated to it , thus a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asound sensors , chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically introduced wor@@ ms that some of her Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ ons wearing TR@@ P @-@ 4 audio channels .
when he uses ultr@@ asound to the changing creatures , the sound waves are strengthened by the micro@@ algae and put to the wor@@ ms , where they switched on the changed m@@ one@@ ur@@ ons .
the method has several simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a pione@@ ering tool that deals with neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ic@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound tissue can be sent upward , and can be sent to the brain from above on the brain .
&quot; we believe that with genital therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make human neur@@ ons temporary for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications might focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Ban@@ sys Dis@@ m@@ and .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ in@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex , artists become critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .

eight golden rules for living in student halls
I spent eleven years ago in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral relev@@ ance , but only now I remember the attached smile of those who I had ge@@ ared - and to numerous , long @-@ tech complaints about others .
most of what I have learned is dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the train in residence halls reaches from easy @-@ to @-@ end up to absolutely exhau@@ st@@ ible .
it is temp@@ ting to ban@@ ces : people tell whence you come , where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you do not love Mar@@ m@@ ite neither dear , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha that I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interests .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find man find out those who would not talk in contrast to those where you would not talk , even if your lashes would be gr@@ illed and fire .
let people let humans .
the rooms of people will transform itself into drinks @-@ reception , film night venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people pulling on their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not think to start at the University with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted a rough treatment at the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want you to go on our friendship , but you must go , so that I may take the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ ones of soci@@ al@@ izing are exhau@@ sted - and send an SMS to it .
A@@ pro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he looked some things .
simply close friendship through baking .
since you start the University at the high point of the back Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck of the doors of people in order to imagine having a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have anything b@@ aked . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade lots of lor@@ ries is a good way to close friends .
their roomm@@ ates are obliged to maintain themselves , and will associate your face in the end , perhaps with a pleasant surprise .
of course it depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps from flour , sugar and fat make sure people feel sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling to food , is a common crime in residence halls .
of course , the hoo@@ fs of chickens is a theft , but it is the take of a drop Mil@@ k for your tea also ?
check that with the dairy factory .
the chances are good that they say themselves to use themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
when someone claims your interest , it is anno@@ ying , and you &apos;ve got my compassion - but try to deal with it as my roomm@@ ates who added their milk a r@@ ins@@ ing to lose di@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , people of sleep or from work .
it is not just the way to be a contin@@ ous person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the word , people belong to the people who sit in the Gl@@ ash@@ aus .
a girl in my way asked her neighbours , if there is something like to them to make them drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than it is 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had another test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to music with even loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 pm they left their neigh@@ bors who left her own music before she left her own music and ended her three hour exam .
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would get into the same student residence by chance ?
vice vers@@ a , it would not be ab@@ out@@ deeply ately , if you have a roomm@@ ates for your future sp@@ ouses to separate themselves , and they will need to see each day and perhaps , as they all come up with all of our common friends ?
of course , the heart goes through its own ways , but when a hot co @-@ hab@@ it@@ ress is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to agree to your shelter a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that som@@ ebody has its key in its not closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing , when it seems .
a good battle is fun , but it only takes moments when he gets to the b@@ um@@ er@@ ang .
then divide a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut up your door , and put your keys into a glass of water which you then place in the freezer - but drives not expos@@ ures their owners on the ceiling no more than twice .
- H@@ ousing Complex for Refu@@ ge@@ es , All @-@ Ro@@ asted , Ger@@ ing@@ or@@ iti@@ er
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gu@@ dner reli@@ es on Central Ban@@ ental Eck@@ ental H@@ ousing Complex for people who have not a lot of money .
so for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need student space , but also the m@@ ist mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ serve . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and build today as well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old interview .
thousands of refugees will be in a home market .
business@@ man Markus Gu@@ dner reli@@ es on how quickly the hab@@ itable living space can be created : it builds in a project for refugees for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ ded , many refugees will be charged in the home market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ ded : the major accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
for people are staying in a large part here .
because of the refugee &apos;s refugee we also need sufficient space for the next decades .
a very special , three storey block house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town house needs the least place .
it facilitates the integration .
that is different if people are putting people in blocks .
each of the six houses built just in the pilot project consists of three apartments for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees are going to say it is again peace , I go back .
then houses can be converted slightly according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
mer@@ cen@@ ary : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
this is reasonable .
have the building regulations simpli@@ fy their plans ?
Gil@@ mer@@ c : I was working properly through my project .
it also makes it especially complicated to re@@ cl@@ ause special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ us@@ eless .
it will still be subject to those who creates in a row house three apartments , needs at least three plots .
only in the cities are the square missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ ded : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
that is definitely not right .
but don &apos;t miss the pre@@ race for paid man@@ sions ?
Gil@@ ded : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but there were luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord .
my project has the message , including the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the m@@ ist mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ serve .
I show you how to build and build today today .
that is why it is .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone OS operating system when Apple Update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by select &quot; General &quot; to create &quot; Android &quot; and then choose &quot; software update . &quot;
when it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have thrust to problems , since they received error message , that it hur@@ ried that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to get around the problem , users are advised to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght flows or trying to update over iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the remainder of the process .
this may probably mean the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so if you need a special tool to delete apps , and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worth knowing that your mobile phone is charged while updating a charging device , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not able to turn the update because the phone might be on half way up and it could lead to a break of the updates .

Croatia : &quot; let us leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls are d@@ angers to our southern border , &quot; said the Minister @-@ Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel parallel .
as it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request will also be &quot; naturally &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and security of humans are in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , &quot; that it takes distinct signals , &quot; said the Minister .
the people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even above the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia del@@ ights &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia rejected
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to go to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
therefore , this interior of the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ bach did not see this .
the idea of Cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; and it will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - especially in Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already strong as an external limit of the Schengen area , on the other hand .
as the Minister emphas@@ ised , Slovenia wants to do its borders for refugees , but are not factories .
&quot; each EU member has to fill his comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; stressed the system of Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had attempted to pass through the border crossing river T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could position them in the upper@@ most ma@@ ize fields .
since then , according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik Croatian char@@ ters has been meeting with new refugees .
it was mainly about Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
life services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , the Minister of Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
Moreover , busses out of pre@@ se@@ vo along the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian Border , which previously had brought migration to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government was denied in Belgrade , however , that it was possible to hit certain people , certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor want it to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , the first bus with around 50 refugees came to the Serb border city of S@@ ID in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
more about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way the whole night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border along the coast of Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary is thinking , so the police said that we are going to drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
this may actually be the predicted shift of existing Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little west @-@ west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for bound@@ ary control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister for the Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a strong states of refugees that have prepared appropriate plans for possible out@@ flows .
he called it not , he pointed out that Croatia is as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive opportunities for bound@@ ary control . &quot;
you eng@@ age strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner since then passed through a good testimony which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , after Hungarian border @-@ au@@ n , about 300 refugees were still ste@@ ady .
according to media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , who led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border check@@ points Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain fully locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , still remains un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to cool on Wednesday at a local time of ey@@ g@@ os : he refra@@ cts the debates about Alternative Refu@@ ge@@ es of Refu@@ gee , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature birth .
it would not be a lot of refugee figures at the moment .
one could not say if they would continue their trip through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers increases to - dangerous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees landing , which altern@@ ate alternative routes through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are still no more cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the conflict .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

f@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ earnings mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex covers dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer giant tot@@ tered his prize in a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation period .
the share came to over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade and 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Group told a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the fiscal year , which ends May the next May , 20 cents less than during the previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 in .
the lower view is , despite the price increases , projected to increase by 4.9 percent , and on January 4 , and despite higher assign@@ ments for bo@@ d@@ goods by heavy and large packages , which will be made from November .
the company said that it is still expected that the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and because of growth in online trading will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will explain a solid operating income as expected in economic terms , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holiday study have been announced a day later at the Ri@@ val@@ en UPS , which is planning to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional jobs , about the same number as in last year .
in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million was spent , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve by Z@@ acks Investment Research , anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to CHF 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks , anal@@ ysts were expecting $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in the past few years F@@ ed@@ Ex has achieved a decline in international priority post@@ age , who brought sales to stag@@ n@@ ating sales in his unit exp@@ edited shipping company .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the findings at F@@ ed@@ Ex .
in the last quarter , sales of transport was reduced by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and goods .
the express unit recorded higher income from higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labor costs in the cargo .
at market trade , about one hour before opening , decrease the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ stock by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.15 .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists two days this week round a 27 feet Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table sitting in order to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the conduc@@ z@@ ins for the first time since almost a decade .
talking about them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story seater Sa@@ als there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a memory that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and its colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold commission from the congress : maxim@@ ize U.S. employment and prices here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that it gives an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct it , as the U.S. economy is ready to announce , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented short term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy might show that they are solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il could constitute the already cant@@ ile representative of the global financial markets to increase these Vol@@ at@@ ility by increasing interest rate for federal bonds - and is also likely to target a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to raise the interest rate , the increased ine@@ quality is around the global market enough to wait , &quot; said it .
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were inter@@ viewed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , wait for the F@@ ed , with a key Indi@@ c@@ ator that indicates a 30 % chance of increasing chance .
this indicates a decline of the share market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists make a blow , they promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy rest@@ art the set in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the phr@@ ases to this point , &quot; he said .
if they do it , &quot; I would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , so that they are not in pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a record @-@ rate hike would calm the financial markets because they act the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
still before a month the F@@ ed appeared on good way to increase the sentence by 0,25 points of this month , the first small step in a slow@@ ing down of mon@@ et@@ ar conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in Spring and early summer that in this year , despite the symptoms of Liber@@ als , more economic progress would be required , an increase of the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and in the level you see the F@@ ed as full @-@ time work .
wage gains have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation is under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them for tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ Core .
but the financial markets around the world looked together at the end of last month after China had given its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell in May by more than 16 % among its high@@ s , than investors left that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would increase the global growth rate .
the market has recovered something in this month , the Dow now is now nearly 10 % below the high amount of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market tur@@ bul@@ let influence the complex calculation when reaching interest .
&quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have appeared in the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee at the US sheet .
now he predi@@ ct that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty that the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the global economy is one of the main challenges of the F@@ ed , hence it should not be included in decision of decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere review of the then leading company Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could potentially have their mon@@ et@@ ous expansion &quot; and revealed tur@@ bul@@ ations around the world .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies , they are increasingly recognized by the F@@ ed representative , that they are not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments in other respec@@ ts but also to meet other central banks and experts to achieve a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for the management management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a history of inter@@ actions on financial markets , which seems to be linked with the economic foundation data . &quot;
L@@ acker , approved member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which was used for an interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its Leit@@ z by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite only recogni@@ z@@ able impacts on growth in the United States , &quot; L@@ acker said .
one year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should take aspects of financial stability while the first place was set to place in the first place in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en said a former member of the Committee on the Com@@ po@@ is@@ oning of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il come not close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains double mand@@ at , and does not mention the Financial St@@ ability , and until that is changed , I think it should not be the time .

Bras@@ il@@ ater@@ nal society Rio Grande funding diet for healthy and breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian dan@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy how important good diet during the breast@@ feeding time . it &apos;s done with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck@@ ish in breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients that they need to create a powerful immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ät@@ et@@ ric adaptation to the mothers .
a current study conducted by the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet showed pregnant women really the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child may influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ k gym
the municipal office Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros co@@ sting gym .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ looking gym on the Bern@@ rie@@ fing sport complex are pro@@ gres@@ sing step by step : in the youngest church sitting , the redesigned building application was blessed without great discussions .
before , the panel had already approved a proposal for a registered , &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; of the valid plan &apos;s plan .
with the exception &quot; the permission was for a special form regarding the roof structure .
therefore , a &quot; arti@@ c roof with not @-@ in First and roof@@ top &quot; is intended to be erected .
background of planning is the scheduled use of roof area for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonder@@ fully big Southern dd@@ ach , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
in the &apos; Liberation &quot; there is again a mission to be prescribed for energet@@ ic reasons - differently than in the construction plan - under ten degrees should be prescribed .
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the planning plan related to the roof level no &quot; exceptions . &quot; the Bern@@ ation@@ der municipality is generally rather restri@@ ctive during the case @-@ up agreement .
however , at the turn@@ out construction this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do no preced@@ ent , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
at costs about 2.3 million euros are calculated .
sub@@ sid@@ y are expected from school and lat@@ itude promotion .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be presented to the Parliament and the exam .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is supposed to be closed as planned earlier - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au , close to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
we see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district circle prior to the Land@@ mann@@ ess Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision to rule the Supervisory Board , and the perpet@@ u@@ ity on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans should be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be moved to Fischer and the adjacent in@@ ward movement to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who can &apos;t work together with Sch@@ ong@@ au , will be offered to a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
she has triggered the change of the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now working to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
in the question who want to compete in succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name of Fischer , came into the game , which was ready to take over leadership and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au , starting October 1 .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in every case a &quot; appreci@@ ation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ator .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized at the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology diseases .
over@@ sized for the next two years fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board conven@@ ed to access both houses , until then the next year the former hospital of the blade , which still has over 35 beds , will finally be closed at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
the County anticip@@ ates this planned for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation of the hospital at W@@ eil@@ heim is completed .
Land@@ mark J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chair@@ woman of the Supervisory Board , came to rec@@ ti@@ ring what the house is located in the ownership of the Federal District Court , in the future to be used as housing for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close this . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there is several ideas .
currently there are a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better things could happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; so fishermen on the Qu@@ i move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positi@@ vely received by the staff . &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a director for over 30 years , did not have it .

refugees need accommodation : study warned of housing
the location on the German housing market is cl@@ amped .
also more refugees seek for a paid lead .
pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing is in front of a challenge .
the distribution events in the German residential home market have long been started .
with the refugees and working centres from the EU , more people are increasingly over@@ loaded on a market which is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
you compete with income w@@ ager citizens for the last affordable app@@ artments .
in order to cover demand for paid apartments , every year 400,000 new units would have to be built .
at this result , a study on behalf of &quot; social housing &quot; social housing . &quot;
by comparison , in Germany there are 26@@ 0,000 units ready in Germany .
there@@ with 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay , as asylum seek@@ ers in a first week of accommodation .
many of them will encounter the housing market and rows in the long shafts in front of the rental apartments .
according to Statist@@ ical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
but the negative development of the residential area is not only to the increasing refugee .
the study also represents significant changes in housing estate policies for the past years .
Germany Schi@@ eves a property deficit prior to her coming from year to year .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study , was roughly 77@@ 0,000 units , compl@@ ying the study .
so many app@@ eals were therefore in big cities not@@ ted in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed for the reason of fle@@ x@@ ing homes for longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in major cities , the number of square metres per capita has decreased again for the first time in the past few years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing has a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incen@@ tives will re@@ plen@@ ish the social housing estate .
thus it could w@@ ai@@ ves the under@@ under@@ ing tax and the basic tax for sponsored homes will be suspended .
Moreover , according to the association , additional tax @-@ control options must be required .
the funding program for refugee camps at K@@ Kf@@ W has now been well @-@ known in cities and communities .
a good week after the departure was € 184 million on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the funding available approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free space : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
Hungary is practically no going through , since then more refugees see the way about Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring countries of Slovenia via the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slov@@ ene Minister of Minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country .
following the overthrow of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees per@@ ched to Croatia to go to Western Europe by the end of Western Europe .
500 people have come about the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , in the Croatian television channel RTL .
on the day before the day he had sealed its border for refugees .
all new laws , which entered into force on the same day , will make almost super@@ flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; they can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and do something .
that people , however , would not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police seized the first refugees in the Serbian Republic of Serbia in the morning of Croatia .
most of the originated media reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian Border city S@@ ID .
immediately after her arrival , they had tried to go on foot across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees cross the bound@@ aries .
this is the limit of other haz@@ ards there : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s .
Min@@ ec@@ lear@@ ner is now to create a safe passage quickly .
then Hungary comes to Hungary after the closing of the border barely more refugees .
on Tuesday , the police counted per cont@@ ested people .
shortly before end of end on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border to us as a criminal off@@ ense .
in the South Hungarian border city Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 years of trial were initiated .
the convicted prisoners of so@@ ber up to five years and deportation from the country .
following the entry of the immigration authority to meet a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday , nearly all of them - 93 - at the main passage of R@@ ös@@ sing .
there are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there have still 40 refugees .
practically , no one has granted one view in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the deemed asylum seek@@ ers will be shot down there .
only a few hundred refugees assembled in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke they began to re@@ wind up .
they gathered a gar@@ bage , which ten thousands of people left on the road@@ side by ten thousands of people .
pl@@ ywood were min@@ ed and rebuilt in place at the border in the border .
one wants to sell this modification with no one .
Austria reached a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has its border controls .
but about 20.000 migrants have gone to government figures but in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning of the German authorities .
in free@@ wheel , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
Mayor of &quot; rock &quot; about the border
&quot; we were still working on Sunday with the entrance , when suddenly there were ten people with travel off@@ ences at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said Wer@@ n@@ st@@ einer mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had stopped due to be surprising because of refugee &apos;s refugee with Austria , it was reached in Wer@@ n@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offer his aid and the stran@@ ded together with two more hel@@ pers and their cars crossed over the border to the near Pass@@ au .
prior to this end , we had only res@@ oun@@ ded the un@@ hop@@ ed guests with snack and beverages .
we have said the same , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; that was , of course , for us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler was in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take to take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; he enjoys us very pleased , &quot; says the Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train pass@@ ers had risen on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train toward Pass@@ au , after the announcement that the rail traffic was discontinued after Germany , but it was still trying to try out the border .
the regional train was removed however before the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein am Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the border @-@ border general is generally high on the course .
the bridge @-@ firm has organised a bridge with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , including a bridge and organised by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
then Vik@@ tor Or@@ b@@ án has sent further thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a apparent policy :
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke warehouse , immediately in the creation of structures , Human@@ ity has officially acknowledged our office and publicly dis@@ closed the position of Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ bearing of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans being con@@ fron@@ ted in the areas of cha@@ otic condition .
even the pl@@ ough@@ s need to state that the &quot; yellow country , &quot; which is invited to take home and welcomed , nothing more than another refugee camp .
there will be a great challenge , in view of the lasting refugee currents and the near Win@@ ters , where de@@ cent states are for the seek@@ ers .
and there will be one more major - peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35,000 tons of re@@ am quartz
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee under way .
Christian Konrad is designed to have his word &apos;s weight .
the government has used the former strong Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set a p@@ inn@@ aker for thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the firstborn of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen - Konrad already received the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great host , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; masterpiece . &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; cold @-@ adhes@@ ion situation . &quot;
the Konrad pit has a total of 85@@ ,000 copies in a very first year .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 properties must still be found in the next weeks - 20.000 are expected to provide 15,000 of the federal states .
there should be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; he said .
with the state cent@@ ur@@ ers , he already had discussions .
they had promised this to create qu@@ arti@@ es even for the next refugees too .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it is good , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ mandate supports Konrad .
there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , there should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
big expectations per@@ ordin@@ ates the asylum @-@ coordination on the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ ps as We . &quot;
private individuals can offer easy and complex accommodation on the platform .
in addition , we hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
on yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in case of notice it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to occupy a certain height of the towel holder or greatness of the order .
for a long @-@ term term , &quot; emergency @-@ standards &quot; would have to apply .
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , becoming a successful , Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly man , in whom you don &apos;t say no more in the face of the in@@ firm@@ ness .
persu@@ ader force is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic not to declare as they declared themselves .
their number of employees increases to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ent was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz ur@@ ges a better distribution
not only the opening of urban@@ istic Spor@@ th@@ allen and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is currently no necessary since people who were able to fit without these measures , says Klaus Lug@@ er &apos;s mayor ( SP ) .
additional locations are expected to be inspected during the emergency .
criticism of the town leaders in the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Minist@@ erial Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ anc@@ inger ( VP ) is responsible for more information in the refugee question on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has covered me that the German borders are not sealed .
the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany are still possible .
but there is now the respective border controls .
some special trains to Germany will not be given to him in Germany .
however , the precau@@ tion were brought to Germany with regular trains to Germany .
in the other EU member states , P@@ ump@@ inger called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
in fact , Austria returns to its borders , &quot; is a logical consequence to &quot; ag@@ it@@ inger &quot; from the pre@@ face of Germans .
the next r@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industry Line was officially completed .
the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T will be set in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) will be available to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to work for us &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could introduce to invest in start@@ up companies in the new ship@@ yard and later also under@@ ing that .
already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - what is the result of which is true : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic is only a question of time . &quot;
from S &amp; T to 1.7 million euros invested in the site , EUR 3.3 million from the Tech@@ centre , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the Land Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been on lease from the Linz Ltd for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as a Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it en@@ quiries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop there are vene@@ ers hand@@ bags in the centre .
in fact , J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to have a dog .
this project had to sum@@ med up the 49 year old Indian propriet@@ or of L@@ ia Per@@ oni into the Tau@@ en@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad market : finally , it finally has got an increase in the form of another business .
in the Fur@@ la shop across the store , in which they sold under other pockets , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything is turning to the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets for 75 euros .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before the first several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; but I didn &apos;t consider how to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
decisive for the decision was among others that the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a own location to which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only one in the Great Hall of Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has also Italian roots .
your fashion interest has received Bre@@ it of their mother in the cra@@ dle .
I de@@ af the most , if something is developed and I can show new trends in performance prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in favour may also answer the house@@ wife with the last security .
maybe it is easy to get a nice bag of each out@@ fit .
the s@@ ali@@ j@@ es@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place , named An@@ onym .
this property is also communic@@ ating with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become president of US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always ready for exc@@ itement .
whether he comments foreign @-@ so@@ or@@ ally , journalist male , or lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the Presi@@ dential Office for@@ ged the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cuts perfectly well .
this will also be registered in the Pf@@ al@@ ous K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate markets are in society .
the New York with the conc@@ ession is a concept in the win@@ eg@@ ir@@ ish at the Wine Road .
man@@ ure in the 1200 inhabitants is about -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the main city of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what think the vill@@ agers about his aim , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that &apos;s somehow to get exciting , but there are no way impressed by her cro@@ oked way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts , about which Tr@@ ump also belongs to the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for PA , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also word - according to the statement that he would certainly also be successful when he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it there to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also that Tr@@ ump &quot; says that Tr@@ ump &quot; was a bit big w@@ alled , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random is given the sur@@ name , the sur@@ name in the vicinity , &quot; The Ab@@ ul@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to be German : the makers , says she .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the an@@ onym .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the first grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a local currency for Gold@@ gr@@ ä@@ ber in the USA .
in New York , the foundation stone of real estate sales in New York .
but life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : your wish to return to history due to the duration of the Bavarian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was then belonged to the Palat@@ inate .
he did not assume tr@@ ump , because he was not di@@ gest without hom@@ ologation , the director of the Institute for P@@ urs@@ ing History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explained to film production .
Tr@@ ump was the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
that is right in contrast to the coming statements of the desc@@ endant .
this repe@@ ats over Mexican immig@@ rants in the US and demanded the construction of a mar@@ g@@ inal wall to det@@ ain illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a left @-@ man of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &apos; ) .
the win@@ emaker in retirement looks up to the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so aw@@ thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine &quot; that the 72 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; he never car@@ es about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension funds in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter was mentioned that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz Family with a visit to the church organ , which was generally well pleased .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine Donald &apos;s , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
they are better if he did not know the choice , because &quot; the one has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
if those who had at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been , as he had , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ast Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and when President ?
&quot; my President is not &quot; my President , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the pre@@ sidents of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , which has been inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ chers , also in the USA w@@ akes its interest .

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson &apos;s arrows to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report to the loss of the Liber@@ al leadership of Liber@@ als , but it did not have major shi@@ fts from the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ ard took up the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Rival Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ths , were in London as a part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , to which also Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
the dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play an opportunity for Australian TV viewers , as a set of 39@@ 7,000 spectators at the five main cities compared to Today 33@@ 9,000 .
Today , a slight increase on the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind those of the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today has closed the gap ahead of the sunrise period in the last months .
in August , Today came on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise in August .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
in September , sunrise at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators are up to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators .
this is the most interesting what happens every morning .
the winds of the change affect this morning more than the Parliament !

the great news for the Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of packed gr@@ illed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recently abandoned father , which closes up with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had asked if Thomson was a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and stroke the block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famil@@ ies ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Chase Australia Nine is to be confident that hot @-@ lab@@ eling is ultimately hanged around 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but whom will he choose ?
dis@@ closed secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have possibly made manifest , who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman , at which Sam Wood used in The Bachelor in 1979 , has been covered in secret services .
and no one of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up if she is the one that received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may have acci@@ dentally put a reference to anyone who will be the winner .
Sam Wood owns his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have settled on ly@@ rical manner , why Wood is the perfect guy and named His sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner in .
however , if the question is changed &quot; If not you , who should get to the last rose ? , &quot; could not get their answers to the player , who won the child &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki mentioned both quickly - apart from himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood spoke about a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment , when I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I noticed that Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows &quot; throughout the course of the show . &quot;
Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on earth , it makes so much fun to be with her , added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that it would be especially suitable for Sam Wood as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the building visit of the house was clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this obviously not just a game - I &apos;m right now un@@ conditional , &quot; said it .
and when asked , who should be interested , if not she , then she was av@@ eng@@ ul@@ ously .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left ma@@ iden alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast@@ ed on Ten in Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .
originally , as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .

Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed its true face in the dressing unit according to the game .
in addition , instead of his R@@ ook@@ ies , he encouraged them to grin@@ d the mill in front of the mill .
Tom@@ s@@ ula felt Hay@@ ne public in his press brie@@ fs after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by speci@@ alis@@ ing teams Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who for@@ getting to him his pat@@ ched f@@ ang and to worry about the next game .

&quot; that was a thing that happens now , it takes care of only the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; says Hay@@ ne .

free elec@@ torate is calling for the high refugee figures with the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ eng warned at the start of the FW @-@ autumn cl@@ or@@ ship at the start of a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there are for the many new students not according to new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ eng .
&quot; otherwise we will get mer@@ chan@@ ger in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the ordinary Sunday heading of the open voters will be held until Friday in the lower municipality .
actually , some other major topics were fore@@ seen .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free voters meeting .
&quot; naturally , the subject will be applied for the cl@@ aws , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ eng .
Ai@@ wan@@ eng requested the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria as well as during the conflict in the nin@@ eties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
past asylum seek@@ ers want to slide the free voters as fast as possible .
therefore , we demanded &quot; more staff for administration , who are responsible for asylum . &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum procedures , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ eng .
the FW -@@ boss critic@@ ized that several German states are not systematically implementing : &quot; we need national standards of Germany &apos;s national standards . &quot;
&quot; Bayern is p@@ ushes forward , others not . &quot;
&quot; there we must be more cour@@ age@@ able . &quot;
but the state @-@ cultural policy will not fall below the table .
a year long per@@ spiration will remain on the agenda : the picture policy .

but that &apos;s not bad enough .
&quot; the issue of G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss .
we call for all high school students who want to do it .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen trained rubber belts on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy killed in the southern Nepal , after the police triggered Gum@@ mig@@ dor@@ f@@ in into a human amount issued against the proposed new Constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , some 175 miles ( 175 miles ) west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of Regional Secretary , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of which threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , then shot in the air before they returned to rubber belts .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the employed rubber belts , of which they could kill , that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously such a high death rate produced .
the strug@@ gles was the last week of violent protests in Nep@@ als &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed as part of the proposed new Constitution would decrease their political influence .
there was also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that would like to have its own country .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been strug@@ gles in violent cl@@ ots since the 10th .
August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which was ruled by centuries .
working on a new constitution since 2008 is based on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature en@@ acted this week via certain cl@@ auses in the constitu@@ ent design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday .

Google launches a bi @-@ donation campaign to earn 11 million US $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( goo@@ gle . O ) announced a post@@ ing donation campaign to bring up 11 million US dollars to humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European Nations because they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations raised on his blog .
instead of a manager wanted to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google @-@ member who has escaped with her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , over her personal experience .
&quot; on our trip there were many dark lines and busses , like hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and the migrants in Europe had grown in Europe , many people are des@@ per@@ ate using my family .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally donations collected up to $ 5.5 million up to google@@ .com / h@@ er@@ als to $ 11 million .
Europe is con@@ fron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who distributed more than 4 million people this year .

for slightly overweight diabet@@ ics , weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss for non @-@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say that slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss reductions longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data will need a long time to reveal something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama hunting .
weight loss medication or o@@ besity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to nour@@ ish food .
over the years o@@ besity has proven to treat type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies were carried out among people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI net : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of o@@ besity - Mag@@ ician ypass and stomach cancer - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI among those who undergo this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 % to the end of the fifth year in that study .
however , the BMI among those whom non @-@ surgical treatment treatments received approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease is completely dissolved and 28 % partly .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison to the diabetes , diabetes itself was only achieved with one percent and partially only about two percent .
furthermore , the results were carried out in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol . &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; they found the authors .
the researchers also out@@ performed the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c eye level , refle@@ cting blood glucose levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held at 7 percent and write the researchers .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also offers average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass Surgery Group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ric rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs 2.1 % ) and reported a complete breakdown of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study did not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who undergo o@@ besity surgery , accounting for 29 percent less likely in 15 years - compared to a group that conven@@ tionally tested the conventional methods .
although the new study did not have advantage of survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people who are interested in a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group lower than , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight , once the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; said it .
I think that once these genetic changes have been accumulated , which have attached their bodies with o@@ besity and diabetes , a ru@@ ring is really hard . &quot;
love story is playing in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück

beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for people of the reader , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding settlements .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the true solution of refugee crisis is in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders commissioned to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama thought the problem of the continuous refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dedicated to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances of the conditions of humanity the interests of the individual nations or even continu@@ ities should be submitted .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries belong to the refugee crisis is true , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
though the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to raising the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , to which Muslim countries may be created . &quot;
finally , we must think about how the killing in its countries is reduced .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama thought the problem of violence and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s actions after the terrorist attack in September 11 and proved that the violent reaction of the US went out a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after 11 September , I expressed my supplement in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know , his moti@@ fs were good , but he prevailed violence , and that had called unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four times increase by taking @-@ consuming devices through children in the last 4 years
tox@@ ins control centers in the USA reports about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , producing soft &amp; alcoholic beverages , so the Georgia G@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from disinfection products increased from 3,@@ 266 for children under 12 years , from 3,@@ 266 for 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly frequent to those products , and sad@@ ly , a percentage of them go into the emergency , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some of disinfect@@ ants do not drink , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or use a mutation in the social media .
record Videos on YouTube , such as yo@@ ungst@@ ers drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens also have mixed disinfect@@ ant with alcohol content mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
recent children can be awak@@ ened by attractive dri@@ v@@ ents of disinfect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attra@@ ci@@ des ( hand disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are ready for use .
there are disinfect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange shower that are very attractive for children .
hanging products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants may already make a few g@@ ashes to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ emergency call at the University of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not let no si@@ p be whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four spra@@ ying of straw@@ berry du@@ cks in the school , was taken into a disaster recovery .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which is considered to be considered by an adult , Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor \ &apos; doctor who was treated at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ashed their words and was not able to go when she arrived in the not@@ ary .
doctors supervised them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and got down the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very impressive stig@@ ious , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ hen &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have gam@@ ble for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended to use parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection products outside the range of the child .
some alcohol po@@ is@@ oning were linked with deaths .
in 2013 two women were found in Ontario women after sli@@ des@@ ks of hanging , which contained a toxic , non @-@ clear ingredient .
the employees of health authorities assumed that the product contained me@@ thanol , rather a deadly solution , rather than ethylene oxide , which has been not@@ ated as an active substance .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , who po@@ is@@ oned to po@@ is@@ oning up the &quot; teacher &apos;s anti@@ bacterial products &quot; following the class@@ room , it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against hanging , and apply them from their room .
the police looked at the failed plan , &quot; W@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authorities .

de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ kings are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the leader@@ boards .

there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m Games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see those games .

now we want to come out as fast as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it rises .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period May @-@ July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had risen by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the level of U@@ K@@ s by 5.5 per cent , as well as the figures of the National Statistics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
in the course of the quarter , employment rate in Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure of 7@@ 3.5 percent over the UK average .
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the newest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland met the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why I will be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except in the late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an au@@ ditorium at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was already mentioned for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I felt right .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
so , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would be a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists in the USA must see , and often more applications are available as places at your disposal , a more wireless Lot@@ ter@@ ie takes place to decide who will choose .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected to keep it in the emotional moment .
I cannot do that .
next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps I will sit together with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone convers@@ ations and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much , if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to pick up what I see .
I just have to try to remember to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of recording my im@@ partial nau@@ sea on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the in@@ mate , as he wants it , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
she just lear@@ nt that she could have better form@@ ulate &quot; but she still think that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to book an international re@@ porter , to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations of the movement is to help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would ple@@ ad him to be a bene@@ fic@@ i@@ ary of crime .
but I think there &apos;s a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I sure there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really obj@@ ec@@ tively .
there will be other re@@ porter , where you can apply .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man un@@ necessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to embar@@ k on it and threat@@ ens to finish the racing
Peter Moore said that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the st@@ ew@@ ards and the Integ@@ ral Unit of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on a racing day treatment , the last stro@@ kes on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what is best suited for racing sport , and he found himself under difficult conditions as it went around the positive co@@ b@@ alt sk@@ ies in Li@@ dar@@ is where he cannot explain which he could do .
he had res@@ ur@@ ged 18 months because of the sp@@ y accus@@ ations and would not want it to see as high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing about it , and I have a long time to eat , but sometimes you are even fru@@ str@@ ated that everything goes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it happened .
sometimes it re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to go through the main , and I want that my owners think I try my best for them .
if you begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I then need to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had announced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , encour@@ aging the integrity department to put out his barn .
&quot; those eigh@@ teen months Mid@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ an Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will be asked if I will be asked - and I will give him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on ra@@ ing.com .
they apparently , that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they can certainly deal with their n@@ oses , because they have failed to ple@@ ad myself .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RUF , David Moo@@ die , am@@ orting president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , current CEO by Route L , were aware of this at the time and are today still today .
should I bring it to the view that it is personally used ?
has Route L prev@@ ailing , and perhaps people outside of co @-@ train@@ ers are responsible for what is going to be in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the branch ?
perhaps the people think there is that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and remove me , and I have no doubt that what I say you can think about it now .
but I just arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on it and push them out to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the cre@@ dential levels of the Train@@ ers has built up for the long @-@ day co@@ b@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching led to him that he could carry out his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , the best known by its preparatory work of Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race Sunday treatment usually &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a packet of mud or clay was applied to the horse powers .
&quot; it is against the regulations of racing sports .
I must take responsibility for the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has m@@ apped mud on the leg .
that night could have been such a night .
yesterday , it would have been so yesterday the day so what was the case .
but it was like the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . a research of this aff@@ air was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see a fact that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ ava proposes to fight ri@@ vals due to ri@@ vals due to st@@ akes
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ ava has marked criticism of the tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson says that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring struggle &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Som@@ a coach Wayne Bennett made a barely she@@ et@@ ted ann@@ ot@@ ation for the CM Storm , after his team had made the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land c@@ ov@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; by the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land did not be &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ ero@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that she only focuses on her &quot; contact &quot; tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy said that the criticism of the two leading coach in his crew was confident , since it may seem that they are wor@@ ried about to be defeated by the Storm Team .
&quot; that appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson at Ring@@ ve responded better when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ ava said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed in the whole year nothing at our def@@ ective system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus and that made us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore likely to be able to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny as it appears again in this season .
Bell@@ ingham has attacked her idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons will win the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long@@ suffering &quot; football .
Wayne tells of exciting football .
he took his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne told me that he will take care of a sh@@ utter .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you would like to play , if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play as these .
I build up confidence because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit concerned , to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think about us when it went about the Big Games .
Bell@@ ava also pointed out that the game Storm delivers a higher result than the play Bron@@ co to cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is that exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points a bit ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me there are the sched@@ ules .
if they relate , it means that we will meet at a stage in one phase .
the Storm Team has set off this weekend as they won the right to welcome North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the advance of A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from the coming Tuesday morning .
p@@ addle with a 200,000 $ deposit on drug deposits
a man who could possibly pay a life @-@ long penalty for its inc@@ eption , to bring property of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who have been gar@@ n@@ ished to Que@@ ens@@ land , has been released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the Federal Police received 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed that he took his co @-@ def@@ endants in the mor@@ nings around the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .

the judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the escape of the river Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
it has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared his court on Wednesday .
at the criminal case he lied the police over his dwelling place .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ em@@ ics mother and step@@ father had a deposit of $ 200,000 as security together and step@@ ping up his release .
&quot; after reading the impressive explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of an additional cost of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter flan@@ king .
but these alone shall not be enough to hold it out of it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he returns to his Australian and his Serb Pass , the police reports a daily basis and at an initial block at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human .
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial authority Te@@ gel which is housed in a very small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human rights , det@@ ain@@ ees were basically applied for financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision made on Wednesday .
those affected may also hope for money , if they were imprisoned only a few days in the close rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus the ex in@@ mate was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : in June and November 2009 he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who had moved back to the good st@@ roll , has been moved back to a large cell in the area .
his official in@@ dem@@ nity because of the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the Land Berlin fail .
but the Constitutional Court took up the verdict of the chamber for the Berlin Chamber of Justice and returned to the case for another trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dig@@ nity .
Chamber of chamber fast decides about the amount of compensation
even though for legal reasons , only a few days of dis@@ assembly for the compensation is decisive , whether a compensation was granted .
otherwise , &quot; a tra@@ ins@@ ult of the person &apos;s legal protection would be feared . &quot;
the chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money compensation .
the Constitu@@ ent Judge have already strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they said only in April of an in@@ mate to damage it , because he was naked in a cell .
as a result of the 2011 decision , the majority occupancy of a cell is also without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court also approved a de@@ cent accommodation in a parall@@ el@@ ism to the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday .
the then @-@ called pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs more than three months , ranged from 15 to 21 hours in a mal@@ ign@@ ant cell like the Kar@@ lov@@ y .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to a lack of head@@ lines in the past few weeks .
prisoners will be shut down repeatedly 23 hours , and the aggressi@@ vity is increasing , and the aggressi@@ vity is expected to have come on account of the cl@@ amped location .
according to the information of the judicial authority , 21 will not be occupied in Te@@ gel for young scientists , 19 shall fall off in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the migration of refugees has an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is decided to accept them .
what &apos;s happening in Germany ?
roughly 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , according to the word of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany even in the situation to record one million refugees .
discussions by German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we are creating this . &quot;
what happens in Germany gives the following overview .
it is needed , according to different proj@@ ections ranging between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments yearly - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living room , but especially in paying rental objects : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the rental prices , and around these especially favourable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Foreign Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is this made from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 Social Sciences annually , and it would have to invest € 6.4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs also agree that there are also more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 percent of the pl@@ ough@@ ed in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany wouldn &apos;t be systematically asked for their qualification to help them , Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , based on the appreci@@ ation of the adv@@ ances , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immig@@ rants , says migran@@ t forced Dietrich Thr@@ issu@@ er .
according to Thr@@ issu@@ hardt , Germany has given a political turn@@ around in Germany : the prohibition of labour for refugees in recognition of labour .
while there was an asylum seek@@ er for asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dency of asylum seek@@ ers at a place of residence .
the company has also set itself - because of the professional coun@@ sel@@ or - majority to vision , that refugees should also be allowed to increase access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are the most common through personal contacts .
thus , the structure of the network drives is therefore custom@@ iz@@ able according to the thr@@ ones of the Royal road to the integration process .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few survi@@ ving parents put their children in the day@@ car@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the kidn@@ ap their parents , it says Il@@ ja Ko@@ cher , spokes@@ person for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate department .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management is divided in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators through the great number of refugees too strongly climb , the Berlin Senate try to raise the training capacity - about by taking more technical colle@@ ges .
students without German language classes are prepared in the welcome classes in the countries .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ill from the Berlin School of Arts .
the German students currently advoc@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
Prin@@ ci@@ ut@@ l under@@ stated no state of asylum seek@@ ers or to study the study - the only exception to date Berlin , the interior of Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its st@@ ance .
in teaching @-@ only refugees , the institution may be facilit@@ ated by the university .
because Refu@@ ge@@ es - in case of jurisdiction or the Auth@@ orities have no benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er law , if they begin studying .
the latter basically gives a B@@ af@@ e , since they are not falling under the circles of the b@@ af@@ e people .
Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees had to have lived until now four years in Germany to have been entitled to B@@ af@@ o@@ g , which had been shortened to 15 months from January 1 , 2016 .
but this financial statements must be closed , but after Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Prize .
the students should get B@@ af@@ o@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of its identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely consider the same rights such as those churches , and the existing state @-@ churches to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ religi@@ ons , to Islam .
it is also important to the establishment of a Islamic Charity Association , who care profession@@ ally around the new@@ com@@ ers .
obligations belong to the rights .
so the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contacts , and be willing to work together with the state in many areas and to grant certain control options .
to this end , the will@@ ing@@ ness to act in violation of religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the wor@@ ries , religious conflicts could also be entered in Germany too .
those who wanted to think such conflicts in Germany &quot; had immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; said he said in Bay@@ ric Broadcasting .
he suggested to settle the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be much more than a theme throughout the society today .
thus the majority society has to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ gent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination law has been a anti @-@ discrimination law since an end decade .
but it is time to learn how the NSU M@@ ord@@ series showed , in the police and authorities were systematically igno@@ red the ra@@ cial motif .
same opportunities for all : what mig@@ rat@@ ory organisations and the stak@@ eholder groups of NGOs under@@ take for the long term and to become an international agreement like the anti @-@ terrorism law in Germany , must become reality in the coming years , if the country must remain peaceful and its new citizens - for benefit of all .
it is generally in Germany as far as anticipated to support medical refugees , the general presence of Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; what kind of power and capacities applies , we do this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
but there is no extra money to flow into the system .
Mont@@ gom@@ ery is required to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks during the registration of healthcare types .
achievements could be accounted for by the German federal states later .
and in the long term it is highly frag@@ worthy , so many people agree with the limited performance of companies that see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise they make up the physicians to create language barri@@ ers .
as far as until today , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ ders are proven that immig@@ rants are po@@ ised beyond their disease than other patients .
not only in hospitals , even in medical practice would have acquired an interpre@@ ting cost , requ@@ est@@ ing them .
many as well , many also have been helping out with more general medical practices in ambul@@ atory patients .
and with another diagnostic look .
there are much more in@@ treated ro@@ dents among the refugee children , and with the yo@@ ungst@@ ers please go to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
the Mont@@ gom@@ ery is clear with the some other diseases of the German doctors , but may know Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite fall or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recogn@@ ise &quot; : and for the general purpose of the state , it is possibly even in sight with the refugees .
the Syrians had an advanced educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
to maintain practic@@ ing pract@@ ising , they must rep@@ lic@@ ate their qualification and temporarily super@@ v@@ ise ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates of the Federal psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) . most likely suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic conditions or de@@ pres@@ sions .
especially the refugee children are particularly viol@@ ated , declared Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich evi@@ den@@ ced that every fifth Syrian refugee school in Germany comes in trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
who is ill in a post @-@ trau@@ matic strain disorder suffer@@ ers suffer from amongst others the so @-@ called flash@@ back with breath@@ s , di@@ zz@@ iness , k@@ eb@@ oot and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration camps , strong scre@@ am and emotional tension .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , Mun@@ z declared an early treatment .
so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees have a psycho@@ therapy .
psych@@ ologically ill political asylum seek@@ ers can provide a request for a psycho@@ therapy , but the process usually lasts several months .
Moreover , in the social agents , there are usually more facts and doctors that are not trained for psychological disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
these lead to mis@@ top@@ ical ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe holding false speech in the Parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he was unable to viol@@ ate , but the video of the fall spread rapidly over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s inauguration was also cont@@ ested by claims from the opposition of the opposition that they had had anonymous death thre@@ ats and warned them to support Mr Mug@@ abe in Bu@@ h@@ vo@@ ke &apos;s speech by Mr Mug@@ abe .
last month , they brought him away and dis@@ sec@@ ted with him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech given on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones they had previously warned of Mr. Mug@@ abe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalist for Mug@@ ab@@ es .
it war@@ ns the affected Parliament &apos;s members that the immun@@ ity will end in parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the spokes@@ man said by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; wor@@ ried &quot; about the d@@ angers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to form 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in terms of restructuring and saving effort in the company &apos;s services .
today , HP will split into two listed companies into two listed companies and split computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected ri@@ vation continues to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ enterprise , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive assigned to the unity after the separation .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger than it HP today is , and we have a wide and deep@@ ening portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are ideally positioned more than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing support , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; thus an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , which has called for the birth place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
hp has under@@ gone a massive re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ally to cover the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturers , and one of the largest US Tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the convic@@ tion that closely focused companies produce better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger emphas@@ izes against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation is running according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss least the next four matches for England and in the face of his history , his participation in the next summer is surely un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season with a separate an@@ kl@@ ash viol@@ ating and then returned to his old swing back during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bones that healed not well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated danger of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return back in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ a 157 Lig@@ ur@@ ry in the past five playing time .
the wider picture for Arsenal &apos;s ar@@ senal estimated that in six out of eight game hours since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs have been involved in most of the occas@@ ional parties .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the risk rates will last over the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a more vulner@@ able time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and combat force , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young enough to overcome these .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will accompl@@ ish a career of this way , which he deser@@ ved .
Arsenal start the Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and W@@ enger is a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not jour@@ ne@@ yed to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta will start in it .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ reale and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep balance and to gam@@ ble the players who need it to g@@ gle up a short break , &quot; said W@@ enger .
although they continue along with a group of F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Park in Zagreb is one of the biggest cuts in Europe with the largest adjustment effects in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten for 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign started in last season .
the stadium was struck on Tuesday night through an earthquake with 3.2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that ar@@ senal has drawn up the teaching from last season with the Champions League @-@ surrender against Monaco and remains committed to his management to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been opened with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I have long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not a dre@@ amer .
friendship feast : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious lessons on male animals
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up now , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ ing in younger men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ .com ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ bic@@ ide life ) announced the year of the man to inform the culture with the goal of looking for the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the heart in order to master this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ press@@ ant symptoms confirmed that , when the suff@@ erer started a suff@@ iciently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his opportunities are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , half a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends maintain the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to get friends once , for friendship can work .
under the age of social media conducted communication , focusing on substance on substance , the in@@ ability of the response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to come heavily , vi@@ bran@@ t and successfully , dou@@ bling , even when in reality , the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ic values name ; money , image , social status , everything at costs in@@ tr@@ is@@ ic values - our inner vision search for personal development and friendship which acts on our spiritual health much lower growth .
and like a video game invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by its personality that sh@@ ined by interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ idi@@ om of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent thro@@ at , c@@ auti@@ ously in football gu@@ sting in cozy arm@@ chairs and se@@ eks of Ross to Rachel - all this came out from the knowledge that men can refer back to any case , even if they are often rest@@ oring their feelings .
as a employee of the telephone money stated to me : ... &quot; my ro@@ g@@ ones for people who feel de@@ pressed and self end@@ anger@@ ed , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends .
the old German spe@@ ech@@ es &quot; I come therefore quite &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talks about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me in my sense when I try to specify long @-@ term growth of mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the small moments of defects .
so very my objective of out@@ sider status information about the phone the phone in sight of des@@ per@@ ation can also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship event with the celebration of the day completely redesigned setting , why don &apos;t take your friends to drink at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you are sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ ship Fest
di Maria hits to help PS@@ G , Malmö and cr@@ ush
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his election on Malmö .
di Maria will present his debut in the Champions League at Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to go on to Malmö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain won his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met fewer than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who put the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed their advantage , when Cav@@ ani achieved a head office in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A , Paris is taking a strong start against the Swedish champion since they did not only promote the qualifying for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the path to the quarter fin@@ alists in each of the last three campaigns .
but while she got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics suspic@@ ious chances in the game against its home @-@ home team and against the club , with which he continued his har@@ ness career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . hence , it &apos;s a good start to create and disc@@ ard our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to read , in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted and we won &apos;t have won , although I regre@@ ts it that we have not yet received one or two other gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to the Paris team after his violation of three amendments to the Paris team that could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but was out@@ fitted in the fourth minute by T@@ ue Maria .
the Argentin@@ ian wing was known as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he went on to the next month of Manchester United , and he interpreted is what he entered in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense before proce@@ eded to Johan Wil@@ and finished very nicely into the long corner of the grid .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was dis@@ appointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off , to reach this level , joined the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national@@ ities on the field and was rounded up with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who was far connected to Kevin &apos;s advice in the 34@@ th minute , they bl@@ ended somewhat in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G even gave up sometimes , with some mis@@ sil@@ es and bad conclusion , not least of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was deposited on no fewer than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani after rest@@ art@@ ing him .
nevertheless , he showed a lot more fortun@@ es when he finished his opponent in the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria in a shooting , which was led by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ est .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his six goal of the season , after Cha@@ ovic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this also finished all thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game and only an excellent viewer from Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result before the replacement player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has made a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave it later that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game ended in December last year .
since then we have played only in the Swedish League that did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not enough . &quot;
hat from front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented the change to the FC Bayern in 2008
world Champion and European champion X@@ avi have been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add sports club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stands in a couple of years shortly before the signing of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona in time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times poker winner , four times champion Champions League , two times European champion , two times European champion , a time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer of the 35 @-@ year @-@ old , he left the FC Barcelona after 24 years of age and changed to Qatar to Al @-@ S@@ add sports club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca exp@@ o X@@ avi it is well that he was standing before the f@@ are@@ well starting of Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça sell me a new wool . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won &apos;t won anything at that time , &quot; he says .
and the registered book is the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; it was a supply of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ ass@@ ig@@ ate wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .

Dam@@ on and Brown turned the link between the industry and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .

Detroit &apos;s tiger turn@@ outs on Minnesota Twin@@ s over
the second half of the season was that the second half of the season was not very fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the tig@@ ers stand in the final place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but they played perfect against the Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the Twin@@ s gave a chance to climb up into a match of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League @-@ card seats .
for Detroit , when it was only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which had been a hard way to summar@@ ise over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories do have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad ou@@ m .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon conducted his early offensive support when Detroit ranks three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside the 1 / 3 inside and made three axes .
it was only the third succ@@ es@@ ful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year very much , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw in bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers of each game , and so I want to concentrate on in the game .
the designed tiger h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Mor@@ ers on July 6 .
&apos;@@ He made the head@@ light well , &quot; said it .
he looked good at the ( demol@@ ition ) , and looked clearly better from the bul@@ l@@ do@@ ers , and it brought them straight to the game .
with three inst@@ alls on the back@@ side at the end of the seventh floor , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning line with a double on the left line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y surpassed the wall to con@@ fron@@ ted the only man with which he was con@@ fron@@ ted in front of the R@@ ook@@ ie drums Miguel S@@ ano , who took a two @-@ run .
having a pair of runners and the finish run in the second , con@@ fin@@ ed the third B@@ CE Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was this in the Major League leading 27 times this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe a Double Play .
after Detroit , at the end of the ninth hour &apos;s inner square , the wall managed a R@@ B@@ I double against the sound of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the law@@ suit will remain S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth row .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by a no more movable P@@ hil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three rings in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted before the game by the po@@ aching list , after he missed more than one month because of a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously , the beginning , I wanted to pray , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt happ@@ ier than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first row , H@@ air@@ was handed down a single second to second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ wood .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z produced Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series of successes in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third B@@ eman Nick Rub@@ ens followed with a single on the right hand , but managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the play as he tried to get to the third .
the tig@@ ers came on the second , set out a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann , and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose about 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not sm@@ itten so well , but he caught the right place .
Hug@@ hes found himself in a pitch @-@ count , no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the rail@@ ing Just@@ in J@@ J.@@ A@@ nel .
at Hug@@ hes there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and one walk with four Stri@@ ped outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was retired because of violations of the roots .
he was resear@@ ched by Dr. James Andre@@ ws that operated the shoul@@ ders of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the case of injuries , due to a shoulder block , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
when San@@ chez comes from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is deleted from the case of injuries to the Twin@@ s .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there are now a Martin @-@ Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of town , Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been baptised a far @-@ free place in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill on the name of the German Reform .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature was requested by the Protestant Churches in Rome in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants were often living in the city of the Pop@@ es of the Pop@@ es about centuries often only in conce@@ aled their faith .
in a symbolic meaning , the tradition of the Christian faith are welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) proved itself as a young August@@ ine mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as profitable for sin .
his negative impressions should be encouraged him in his future battle against Rome in his future battle .
Luther was then led with his thes@@ es against the revol@@ t in the division of the Russian church .
hammer Training invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold@@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that he has painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible that has appeared with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 mot@@ ives .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has gained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - what is by no means much equal with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the particular topics are adapted , it can be quite beneficial .
for the past three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has met a sub@@ jective artistic choice from the many topics of &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are Cy@@ cles , dedicated to themes such as crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
thus it has been spontan@@ e@@ ously fascin@@ ated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is a writer Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who participated in the basis of painting with the particular bi@@ ble quotes .
he interpreted the Bible made by Ot@@ mar Alt and interpreted &quot; it into the today , into current cont@@ en@@ ings . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original Bible school of Martin Luther and each sentence of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jew@@ ellery band has golden let@@ tering .
the 75 year old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
ultimately , emotions had been born for the Bible : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family , who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; then the up@@ bringing ever happened with the cane @-@ stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls .
&quot; I &apos;ve tried to compos@@ e this , in order to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second goal is to re@@ claim the art in faster time to more star@@ vation : &quot; the perception of vision of vision is to be an lame today , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures have always something marv@@ ell@@ ous and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt let the viewer rise up into the picture , &quot; let it rise , discover and feel that power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his face . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost faced Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always had &quot; a lover from Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert art : &quot; I like he had his life experience . &quot;
I do not have to understand the Bible , not knowing the Bible , but for him important , also mysterious themes .
&quot; this was no co @-@ operation at the eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here are some pictures of the text , the text indicates it only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öhler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this piece is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öhler &apos;s ( biblical ) language of love as well as of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that is opened at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , companies com@@ missions , ter@@ istic skills for a circuit lay@@ ered : one year later , almost everything was completed - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X course was finished again .
con@@ sens@@ ory experiences in politics and administration care for out@@ board , especially in the residents which did not want the train .
so , hill sn@@ ake up , new place - now with formal planning and application on building permit .
the approval in October will go down in October , the first community application of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ bu@@ ck was now in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope that this year something happens , &quot; she said .
then without &quot; additional commem@@ oration &quot; should be started with the work at the former s@@ wimming@@ pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ vely engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extending its commitment for refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga commen@@ ces a significant sign in the weekend .
football is respon@@ ding to a p@@ inion position in Germany and securing his aid to the problems of the related problems .
&quot; I consider that for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there is no one to tell you , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that has to get any particular interest to get this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Zur@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ vely impact the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet there the Minister of State Women &apos;s Rights and Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; when the topic is certainly a central role , &quot; he announced .
soccer can help and wool .
but the essential turn@@ outs must provide politics .
therefore , the German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee policy &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we had ensured that this programme runs until 2019 , &quot; ren@@ c@@ tured at the mar@@ gins of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some states support this program .
for this weekend , 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ is set a significant sign when it does on the left tri@@ cot jacket instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ le attitude ( Hermes ) to help &quot; We can help &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ ly Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler &quot; picture &quot; ( Tuesday ) , &quot; said the project as &quot; self @-@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes any time , no one can be seen . &quot;
&quot; we can , no , we need to use our lighting power , no , we have to ut@@ ili@@ ze our impact force , our influence and our opportunities to help many refugees , who already have so incredible , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
the Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
for the EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
kidney bach called the support of refugees as a &quot; large joint work of German football . &quot;
that every 36 licens@@ ing would have started his own projects , be great .
it is also great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , which we have spent , will live in football .

Ro@@ bot au@@ tos : government wants to take lead role for Germany
according to the will of the German Federal Government , Germany is supposed to be the change of the technological pioneer in this process .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Traffic Interior Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which fore@@ sees investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ echanika IAA in a &quot; new mobile era . &quot;
the automated and connected drive will increase the traffic safety and provide a few st@@ out , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he will also discuss the theme with his counter@@ part from the G7 states that together with representatives of the industry .
the Strategic Direc@@ tion of the Ministry of Transport under@@ lines the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast transition on digital radio listening .
a test track is currently being built on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
in order to ensure &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the German government wants to verify the legal framework conditions , &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use an internationally leading to increase the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also aims to deplo@@ y an amendment to the Vien@@ nese Agreement , which has so far seen only the people as drivers .
in increasing driving , the car is taking over the lead , the driver will become more and more passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving can be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless , passenger vehicles can be expected to continue on public roads &quot; just far from 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location value the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency &quot; in road traffic , &quot; the SPD per@@ missions S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol said .
the issue of liability for accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied clearly .
yet , the Germans will show them sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
a survey on Wednesday on the AA @-@ specified survey of the For@@ sa Institute in the order of testing D@@ EK@@ RA is coming to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will prevail in the next 10 years , 32 percent would not count it in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents say by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave themselves fully on a vehicle @-@ driving vehicle .
after an introduction by the B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M digital S.@@ M , only seven percent would agree to control them during the entire trip on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway we could present 15 percent in flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
a good every V@@ ed would not leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; we are strong enough to bring the title without Timo , &quot; said federal trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM study in Düsseldorf .
B@@ oll was located at this point on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed guesthouse in China .

it is a mix of a very big fashion show and a wax figures @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look different to video proj@@ ections during video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , amongst others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits in the big star of the fashion scene - and therefore that he put men in tubes .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was very light , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &apos; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle the Hyp@@ o Culture Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion has changed his original attitude to a vision of his person .
he was really aware that it was : &quot; for me , he was a bit after death . &quot; he said .
if you die , it is coming into the museum .
the impressive collection was made in front of Montreal and Paris Station in advance .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it &apos;ll go to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the ir@@ resist@@ ing work of man , who has written fashion story to have completed an apprentic@@ eship without ever .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work , designed for much effort to rev@@ ise the d@@ olls , for example , an el@@ ist has been hired .
14 tons of material have ar@@ red the makers after details of the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .

as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents were not allowed him to play .
at the same time the throw of fashion , he then taught itself .
he st@@ ole printing head@@ ings and looked for the designs of other designers such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .

jewelry instead of Gard@@ ins - Pl@@ au@@ ra tip as Fashion N@@ ic
earlier it used to make long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen , on foot .
the embroi@@ dered substances and peaks were produced in a large quantity for customers , for example to bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
today the alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the mo@@ an seats .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener top mode , fashion played a larger role , then pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is called a few examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories like pockets and for regional trains .
even the so @-@ called vintage mode , which re@@ jects the past sty@@ li@@ stic potential , is increasing the increasing potential .
who is not operating in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
we already make half of the orders .
mo@@ on@@ yard Ultra is together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener and Sti@@ cking shops together with nine other companies .
only they may bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of its sales have been broken .
private trade and wholesale accounts are nearly no longer available .
our products are hardly able to reach the customers on this road .
today the mass regulations now become much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively through chains .
there are also exports of export , currently in Russia and in the USA .
there is plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tried to score points , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer used by nitrogen per@@ missions in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since that year , we perform a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally @-@ processed . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; it is applied to the materials used . &quot;
thesis in U@@ te Schmidt is at the Faculty of Applied Arts in the Saxony of Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ izes in bul@@ ls and tips .
in order to meet the competition from the Asian region , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
there is a voltage range between the fresh@@ est ideas of designer and men@@ ses who have to think of all economic purposes , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only varied , to keep a customer st@@ amm .
a new fashion designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter recently redesigned the historic sn@@ eb@@ ral centre many years ago .
the machine also embroi@@ dered at some places small cu@@ cum@@ ber .

now they are using the snow @-@ pointed tip for their ornam@@ ents .
in a complex procedure the design character@@ izes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
she also supplies us to the USA , from Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who have lived in peac@@ o@@ ily and surroundings and would like to remember a reminder .
in this way I see my ornam@@ ent as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener .

EU wants to double mercury limit in fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mercury in big smo@@ kers and consumers in order to accept a significantly higher dose of the ner@@ ves .
the F@@ ood@@ watch consumer organization , which is a corresponding figure in the EU , critic@@ ized the plans in focus : &quot; risks and side effects were reduced in industry and environmental policy with full force of pregnant and small to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt was interpreted by F@@ ood@@ le .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is estimated to increase the threshold value for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
major cat@@ fish @-@ fish tend to be strong already today with mercury , that on the basis of still applicable limit values must not be sold around 50 per cent of its length .
according to the dou@@ bling of the limit values only 14.5 percent would be required .
in return for this attrac@@ ting , the EU wants to add the limit values for other fish from about 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , this is known as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , such as car@@ p , mostly imp@@ acted so low , they already comply with the maximum limits already today .
the decrease of the c@@ ens@@ ity is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ able di@@ stra@@ ction maneu@@ ver , helps in the economy alone , &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which is in@@ sufficient for the food chain particularly in rob@@ ber@@ fish .
in this case , the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; small amounts have already been able to cause damage to damage of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment stated on his homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the General population &quot; is not expected .
mercury can be reached above all coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal plants delivered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube may be &quot; permanent and widespread covering , &quot; the &quot; Mir@@ ror &quot; had been cited in the paper from the paper in March .
last year , European war@@ nings about mercury in fish already mentioned to the most common health risk in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
