furthermore , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding compar@@ ing of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the server may not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause a slightly recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum can be mixed with the same amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent infl@@ ations of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be dissolved within a double time , but if the same experiments are dissolved with the anti @-@ A blood group or at a standard presence of equal activity .
is anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum to a object bearer with a same amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent ar@@ em@@ ination of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within a double time , but if the same attempt is dissolved with the anti @-@ B blood group of blood group or a standard pre@@ par@@ ate of equal Avi@@ dity .
if an anti @-@ B + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with a object bearer with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent up@@ swing from A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ by the requirements of which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ er blood cells is achieved .
with others who can be called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; can only be achieved with a presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Sera feeds on object dreams also homogen@@ ous red blood cells that are sw@@ amped in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the determination of the Sera provision for determining the R@@ h group may possibly change if the International standard par@@ ate are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons , identified by the An@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ System immune system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the An@@ tigen D but not containing human red blood cells that not contain the An@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have a tit@@ re from at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ative of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or corresponding compar@@ ing par@@ ate to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the An@@ tigen D , the serum is to respond with blood cells that contain the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , intended for use of object dreams according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have been mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent up@@ swing of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells , within 30 seconds of a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , which are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h @-@ Systems immune system .
it re@@ acts with swelling of human red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen C , but not containing human red blood cells that do not contain the C anti@@ gen .
these wires have therefore only been specific to the C @-@ anti@@ gen , if the tested blood cells tested in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking sal@@ ine solution .
the tit@@ er of anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ C Sera , which are intended for use on objects in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed if they have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination with approximately 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people associated with the anti@@ gen e @-@ system immune system .
anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e @-@ blood cells .
anti @-@ E Sera , which are intended for use on objects in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form Anti @-@ D ) , if they have been mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ % blood cells at about 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained immediately from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as determined by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object dreams is determined according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ incubation shall show red blood cells that show a reaction , not less than in the most popular antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immune by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ized human red blood cells , the A anti@@ gen , that means those of the blood groups A and AB , including the sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that contain no A anti@@ gen , that means those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the recur@@ rent , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood group or corresponding compar@@ ing , separate with swelling of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum will be mixed with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent up@@ swing from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be performed within a double time , which is required if the same attempt is performed using the anti @-@ A blood group of blood group or a standard pre@@ par@@ ate of equal Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immune through red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B immune system .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ized human red blood cells containing B @-@ anti@@ gen , that means those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ anti@@ gen , that means those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the recur@@ rent , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood group or corresponding compar@@ ative tra@@ itor , with a swelling of blood cells of group B to tit@@ ular ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed with the same quantity of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent up@@ swing of B @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within a double time , which is required if the same attempt is carried out by the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard pre@@ par@@ ate of equal Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood @-@ group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against compl@@ ementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immune to human serum proteins .
