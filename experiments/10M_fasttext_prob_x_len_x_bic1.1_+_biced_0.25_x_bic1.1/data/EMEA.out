it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ res thinking and talking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or sight of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psychological illness , in which patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high mood ) altern@@ ate with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat medium to severe man@@ ic episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is applied to rapid control of trouble or behavi@@ oral problems , if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution for inser@@ ting or the melting tablets in patients can be used , which the swal@@ low of tablets are prepared .
in patients who also take other medicines at the same time , the same as Ab@@ li@@ fy should be min@@ ed , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably affects the recept@@ ors for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter seems to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine faced a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ li@@ fy to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three studies over a year .
the efficacy of injection solution was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in a further study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo who had been rest@@ ra@@ zed to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which had been associated with increased ag@@ itation , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms of patients using a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on the treatment .
the company also led studies through to investigate how the body re@@ prim@@ ates the melting tablets and the solution for depos@@ iting ( up ) .
in the two trials with the injection solution , the Abi@@ li@@ fy had received doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms as patients who received placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was effective in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the resum@@ ing man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered to an existing treatment in addition to 74 weeks .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses decreased more effective than placebo as placebo and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , fatigue hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the committee on human@@ ist ten@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy at treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from mid @-@ severe to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had been mainly man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared with the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of trouble and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared with the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , depending on meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not demonstrated .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors just@@ ifies this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sheet is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased superf@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , cardi@@ ac disease ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which can be applied for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( di@@ eh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure medications ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ ies : in clinical trials , which one year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ies , it should be drawn into consideration to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if one patient &apos;s signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be involved in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the an@@ am@@ orous or with states that are treated with caution with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients had treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to un@@ wanted pr@@ un@@ ting events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ can or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no accurate risk estim@@ ations for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ mers , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to Com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ alities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect is observed , respectively of un@@ healthy life , and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be performed .
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism .
if you consider the common use of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , must have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be performed .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ological morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an ) .
the patients should be given to inform their doctor if she will pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
due to in@@ adequate data security for humans and due to the reproductive studies in the animal , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned before , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were considered possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the down@@ side below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total low incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study about 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term accounting for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated for placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were found , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
the CP@@ I ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ y@@ mp@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted pr@@ un@@ ting events and increased mortality in elderly dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or un@@ intenti@@ onal over@@ do@@ si@@ ents with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a path@@ ologic with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely to use hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma processor .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance about the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect is medi@@ ated on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ders and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg , the Pos@@ it@@ ons emissions tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the grid .
in three placebo @-@ controlled trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the proportion of patients who were involved in study medication was similar to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Depression @-@ scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in return rate caused by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia , the 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ i@@ ology studies with flexible and mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over 3 weeks to reduce excessive effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ eutical study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness over placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ists for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I @-@ I , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over a week 3 and a replacement effect that was comparable to the lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks are not performed on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ ate mono@@ l a superior effectiveness in reducing mani@@ pulation in comparison to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 74 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabil@@ isation phase on Rand@@ om@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rep@@ ay , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar response in the mania .
based on in vitro studies , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al @-@ life period is close to approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l at exten@@ sive metabol@@ isation over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the impact of smoking at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe cardi@@ oid failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose of trial in subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull out impacts on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , reproductive ox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to the channel potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed merely with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure during humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid inspection of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ or@@ isation in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under sub@@ jection of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be used depending on the individual clinical status , taking into consideration the drug or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inclusion .
there are no investigations into the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems , which were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ins additionally added to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution as necessary , the patients should be observed concerning extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
testing on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not prescribed for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical pois@@ oning ( caused by using or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , cardi@@ ac disease ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which can be applied for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( di@@ eh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure medications ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which a year or less , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing awareness of consciousness and signs autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse , blood pressure , speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
Poly@@ mers , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to Com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ alities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect is observed and could lead to severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ ag@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as disposable in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine and received the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , must have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ ing reductions should be performed .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine received , the intensity of se@@ se@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .

107 The following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under placebo or were classified as possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term accounting for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated for placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were found , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences .
the CP@@ I ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ ours compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in relation to placebo and similar problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS combined score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness could be observed in terms of the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the proportion of patients who were involved in study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % in both groups .
current values from measuring scales were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in return rate caused by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia , the 3@@ 14 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .

in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion of man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rep@@ ay , predominantly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar response in the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is contained in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C by the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to both forums .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , mean time to reach the maximum plasma concentration of 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and apes well toler@@ ated and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of an objective following repeated treatment in a system@@ ically exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 @-@ times over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular plants .
in studies for the reprodu@@ ci@@ fer@@ ox@@ icity , after intraven@@ ous application , there was no safety @-@ relevant concern after rep@@ utable exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) to security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction ox@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the channel potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed merely in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure during humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , involved in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which three quarters had previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 @-@ treated patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if you consider only the patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in terms of efficacy and survival compared to the deteri@@ oration of disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane acting as conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients , breast@@ feeding or before the start of the treatment with low neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ lic acid in the blood .
the Committee on Human@@ ist Protection ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients with which the first treatment is no longer contained , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing pharmac@@ euticals , it must not be given to other drugs to decrease effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and not displayed for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ in @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phic count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in case of sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy 3 the treatment is reduced , until improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and at all the following cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate effect of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies carried out with the affected kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ adequate data on in@@ fertility and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ arti@@ llery of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological features than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be treated immediately , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ es has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has increased the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not demonstrated in connection with Kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indigenous patient collection was not unusual , especially in patients with earlier Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patient according to the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eti@@ ka and sti@@ p@@ tive funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane shouldn &apos;t be used for pregnant or at women in the bear@@ able age , which are not practic@@ ing an effective conception of contra@@ c@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in the tender age should apply for a reliable verification method for up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is recommended , while and up to six months after the treatment there is no child to testify .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment over a sperm , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and dizziness ( frequently ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ atology tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) and was fast @-@ reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 are the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tose @-@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

am@@ hel@@ pl@@ essness 1 The incidence of excess @-@ sensitivity will be calculated based on a final in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and it was not established with such events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli ingredient that encour@@ ages the co@@ ag@@ ulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli in the Tub@@ ular Indian and stabili@@ zation by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ sis .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is medi@@ ated to the endo@@ thel@@ ial components in endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in part of vitro studies , alb@@ um@@ in promotes the presence of alb@@ um@@ ax@@ el &apos;s transport by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor is con@@ veyed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bic protein SP@@ ARC ( re@@ at@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) is a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a randomised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of the patients had an adverse general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ ated metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % for metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy are laid down .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripher@@ al N@@ europ@@ athy 3 degree during therapy .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to ban on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and still is unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inputs of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 @-@ 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the linear ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration on multi @-@ phase phases took place .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arized distribution and / or crossover network of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent @-@ quality Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue stories , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean drug was 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .
however , over the age of more than 75 years , only few data are available , because only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine , and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be careful when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .

the Member States must ensure that the owner of approval for the market share in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail shops are provided with the following information and materials :
• Training report • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packing material . • With unique image representation of the product advert@@ ised cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference helper &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood levels used in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion of complications , if the procedure is not possible prior to the procedure , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor , which has an experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be done by the patient or of his car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver , if they have a reasonable guide .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ences in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are given prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency consists , and ice @-@ energy , should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who have received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can cause an@@ a@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thus , that the body is not sufficient on the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been brought into a gene ( DNA ) that it adap@@ ts to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration in a v@@ ein in the frame of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who had caused by kidney problems caused by the reference to the reference .
all patients participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been in@@ jected into a v@@ ein before being transferred either to se@@ se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the study period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been investigated at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy alone .
in the study with patients who had caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , were calculated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) , such as sudden , stub@@ ble heada@@ ches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients that possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ och@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , since further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been achieved in accordance with the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the se@@ amed , will provide information on the safety of the medicine , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval to the Medi@@ ce medicine P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multip@@ lier my@@ el@@ oma who can obtain chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion ( for example cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia occurs at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency , which require a large percentage of surgical interventions , which demand a large blood @-@ volume measures ( 4 or more units of blood on women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed may be used in front of a large @-@ elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery in adults with no iron levels in which a high risk of trans@@ fu@@ sions is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 m@@ l. are used , which can not be part in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except at p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,8 m@@ mol / l ) .
angi@@ ogenic symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical development and disease advoc@@ ates are required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to vari@@ ability between patients , patients can occasionally be observed with individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values above or under the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster is more than 2 g / d@@ m@@ mol / l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the long @-@ term hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ och@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa must be used in the lowest @-@ approved dose which is necessary to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher adverse requirements than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher adverse events than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .

angi@@ ogenic symptoms and - follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical development and disease advoc@@ ates are required by the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ och@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa must be used in the lowest @-@ approved dose which is necessary to control an@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value , at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ rent number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose of 150 g / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the recur@@ rent number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose should be raised to 300 / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 mg / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ity increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ rent number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ L should be retained at a dose of 300 mg / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ rent number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , a response to the ep@@ etin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ supply unit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serv@@ atives is required , se@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 , / kg body weight should receive twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .

controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit , which is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins , when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased to control of an@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ous cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or cereb@@ ral in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in paragraph 4.2 of the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
after the present results , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , which is not accelerated to progression of kidney failure .
in patients suffering from cancer patients , ep@@ etin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ fun@@ ded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dosage must be adjusted to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapist @-@ related an@@ emia - dose custom@@ ization with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction under the participation of their patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery , if possible , before the ep@@ etin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ go to a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ o proph@@ yla@@ xis , since it is an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded , that treatment with ep@@ etin al@@ fa could be achieved with an initial risk value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l. a higher risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cul@@ ular events .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ och@@ ine was not demonstrated that they improve the overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia .

in case you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ine , it will break your therapy with se@@ ams and define how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated due to an@@ a@@ emia due to a ren@@ al disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ glo@@ omy is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
for increased or offensive cali@@ bre , your doctor may consider a dis@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ al@@ ment , until the cali@@ bre are again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or ag@@ itation by in@@ adequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation level exceeds a specific value .
according to present knowledge , the treatment of blood alarm with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic ren@@ al kidney disease ( cardi@@ oid in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not accelerated to the progression of kidney failure .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your physician will determine your values of red blood @-@ coloured ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and custom@@ ize your absorption dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood whi@@ st@@ ion ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) as little as possible .
this risk should be treated very carefully compared to the treatment with ep@@ etin al@@ fa , in particular if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events or if you have already occurred thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events or if you have already occurred thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. deep cl@@ ab@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or lung em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
in case you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can influence the tumour negative .
if a major orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of treatment of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood @-@ coloured ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , because an increased risk of bleeding formation after surgery consists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor if you are assigned to certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ in .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following illnesses : • O@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle the bone ) both in women after men@@ opause .
it is used in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including those who have suffered a low trau@@ matic hat@@ ch like falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hat@@ ching should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injec@@ ting into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) in the three days after the in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta only could be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta same is as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to review by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who had suffered a stro@@ kes , the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta tested 3@@ 57 patients with a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
main indicator for the efficacy was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood is norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women , the risk of flu@@ frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other o@@ steopor@@ osis drugs ) was reduced by 70 % compared to patients under placebo .
in comparison with the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving males and women with hat@@ s , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had 9 % of patients receiving placebo ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of acet@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repet@@ itive in@@ fu@@ sions .
acet@@ sta should not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against ri@@ val@@ ry acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ or or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion centre and o@@ ste@@ o@@ ek@@ sis ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fying material for doctors willing to ad@@ ore the Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis as well as the similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the medicine should be explained and pointed out when they should apply to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Roche Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to grant approval from Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in men with an increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in males , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once annually .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch , the administration of in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta will be recommended for two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hat@@ ce ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long r@@ ins@@ ing period of patients was observed in patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch , an initial dose of 50,000 up to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney problems ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended , since limited clinical experiences for these patient group are present .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose custom@@ ization is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data are missing on in@@ fertility and efficacy .
acet@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe cardi@@ oid in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ ine is before the treatment of treatment with acet@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick installation of the effect of ri@@ val@@ dr@@ onic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , with symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ine can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer diseases , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be examined in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , there are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the ja@@ w area .
clinical assessment due to the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ sta , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of acet@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious side @-@ reported cases of occurr@@ ence was increased in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ structure Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to the incidence of pre@@ ten@@ ants between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic has been associated with kidney dysfunction associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases than acute kidney failure .
the modification of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured in front of the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function in O@@ steopor@@ osis was similar to three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings the temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ atic calcium levels occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hat@@ ching and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip fra@@ cture , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the ja@@ w range , especially with cancer patients , above o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the or@@ tho@@ ress ) reports that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ onic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tra@@ c@@ nex@@ tions or other dental handles .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients occurred O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ on@@ rose in a ja@@ w range with acet@@ sta and treated patients with placebo .
in case of overdose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ine , can be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was given at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a slight or a medium @-@ severe cycl@@ one or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the jack@@ als of ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing verteb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ rical verteb@@ rates Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly increased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new spine ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had decreased by 60 % , compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta proved an equal effect over three years , which resulted in a loss of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar , hips , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the total hips by 6.0 % , the reduction by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ at@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients compared to placebo an increase of the supporting bone volumes and the preser@@ vation of the supporting bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) serum samples were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the initial age of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial age after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial age of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial age of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D at total stock@@ ings and scra@@ per as at all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta Treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo for an increase of BM@@ D at 5.4 % in total stock@@ pil@@ es and 4.3 % at the scra@@ per .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in a different study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , once again the annual administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once included in comparison to the percentage change in the Leningrad verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been examined with radi@@ ologically confirmed in patients and patients aged over 30 years ago ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of in@@ fusion of 5 m@@ g. of ov@@ o@@ zone @-@ acid compared to in@@ gest@@ ation of 30 mg ri@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of compar@@ ative studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief is observed in comparison to the output value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified in the end of the six month study were classified as Respon@@ sibility ( on the therapy ) , were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study was administered by the 143 by Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 in the follow @-@ up study , compared to 71 of the patients treated with the acet@@ ate patient , compared to 71 of the patients with ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate patients to be maintained during a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ onic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved themselves as dos@@ ages .
after that , the plasma level rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % to 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
quick single @-@ phase disappearance from the big cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β @-@ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long eli@@ mit stage with a termin@@ ale elimination phase t ½ h 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) , probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tions about the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose is tied in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body cle@@ ance is independent from the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of interest rate acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced cle@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems met@@ abolic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ onic acid is not met@@ abolic , and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ ance of the ol@@ d@@ onic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it emerg@@ es that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function can down to a Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min , no dose custom@@ ization of the zinc deficiency .
because of heavy ren@@ al problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ circular intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , individual doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C contains 6@@ times of the recommended ex @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al irrit@@ ation .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that is equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , which corresponds to the 7@@ x of the Human @-@ therapeutic exposure , which is equivalent to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulative application , the maximum of the intended human exposure has exceeded , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common failure in studies with repeated application was a multi @-@ primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ fication of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a result that reflects pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats you observed a Ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity with doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton .
in rabbits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of serious serum @-@ calcium mirror .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; perio@@ dic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a superior R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence the present statements on safety , pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for the minimum of 60 days , when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) has been achieved . • Requi@@ re@@ ments the EMEA .
Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ese is a representative of a sub@@ class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ rogen formed by and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in a rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure takes place too fast , and a new bone material is un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works as norm@@ alized the bone structure , ensuring a normal bone formation , making it once again strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or have to under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in use by Ac@@ la@@ sta with other drugs , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or care personnel if you have taken other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are using medicines , from which it is known that they will harm the kidneys .
in applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and beverages , you are concerned that you take enough liquid according to your physician &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you recently have broken the hips , it is recommended to advance the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip break .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may have a further dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in the time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta missed you immediately with your doctor or hospital in connection to make a new date .
prior to completion of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects related to the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , however , after the following in@@ fu@@ sions , however , are less frequent .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at present it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heartbeat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage and conditions of up to the application ; typically , 24 hours are not exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch is advised to advance the in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hips .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta the patients must be supplied with fluid ; this is especially important in patients who receive di@@ u@@ ret@@ inal therapy .
due to the quick installation of the effect of di@@ ole@@ onic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic can develop , hypo@@ kal@@ ine , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch , an initial dose of 50,000 up to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of acet@@ sta .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European public distribution report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ ist Protection ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the study conducted to proceed to recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) is not indicated in patients ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) . • It can be used together with another diabe@@ tic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be retained , except in patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of the sulph@@ ur@@ ylene oxide or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level is decreasing , making type 2 diabetes better .
with more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition , they received either acet@@ one or placebo for 3.5 years .
in studies , the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels have been lowered with application of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients receiving the Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin measures resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were bl@@ ur@@ red vision , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( common cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
acet@@ one may not be used in patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ can ( high viscosity levels - acidity level - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos was used as an alternative to a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission distributed the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to provide approval from Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , arch@@ ed and bear on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient to in@@ adequate and in@@ appropriate for which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance is in@@ appropriate ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are threatened by the presence of at least a risk factor ( e.g. earlier , heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose progres@@ sively .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or ec@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced kar@@ di@@ ous reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced progressive macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard division ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on cannot be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased , the liver amounts are as soon as possible again .
if a patient is developing symptoms that indicate a he@@ avi@@ an dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , upper @-@ condition , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite , and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver values to check .
the decision , whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is continued , should be led to the preliminary parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can stir in fatty deposits and in some cases with a fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a hem@@ og@@ el@@ ution in therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a reduced reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by about 3 @-@ 4.1 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in um 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who received Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl@@ hard foam or as a double combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
after the market launch , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported to report an appearance or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ es , however , should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , when patients should report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic statement should be considered .
in summary analysis of undes@@ ired events concerning bone mar@@ es from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated freight rate was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were compared to 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if one patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is prescribed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the analysis of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ sins and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs that are met@@ abolic from these enzymes , such as oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to increase 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to due to the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the parent and reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fine growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( derived from the data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the index of lenti@@ l , as they are observed in other hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T margin over three times the upper limit of the standard range is frequently common to placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine disease was the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely over heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been reported but more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ orous .
there was a summary analysis of undes@@ ired events concerning bone mar@@ es from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , frac@@ tures appeared at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to work with activ@@ ating specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases peripher@@ al glucose in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until the after@@ math of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be calculated by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficient despite the three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value declined by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation into type 2 diabe@@ tic states .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d decreased .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
in the study after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which insi@@ sted that the blood sugar level was similar to a human exposure .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is the package level ) .
the Committee on Human@@ ism Ret@@ ard@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes over the risks increased .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Roche Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .

patients whose blood glucose levels has improved considerably through an intensive insulin therapy , hypo@@ glyc@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , single @-@ phase insulin , long @-@ acting insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA of insulin origin ) can cause that a change of dosage is required .
if the switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required in the patient a dose custom@@ ization , this can be necessary in the first dose or months after conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal insulin occurred , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin .

the present document is a summary of the European public distribution report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the study conducted in order to achieve recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
the practice of an effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the process of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology . &quot;

acet@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients , possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
furthermore , doses of acet@@ p@@ id may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the approval of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S with approval from Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin delivery must be re@@ ared , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is required in the patient a dose custom@@ ization , this can be necessary in the first dosage or months after changing the conversion .
prior to travelling , which should go over several time zones , the patient should take it to take the advice of his doctor since such travels , insulin and meals have to be applied or taken to other times .

the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum concentration is reached within 1.5 @-@ 3.5 hours and the total activity duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sum notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alline , which can lead to joints and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still higher than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ateral , the dose may be increased to 120 mg daily for two to four weeks .
during the first treatment months you can still occur g@@ low cases ; therefore it is recommended that patients should have at least one more medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transpl@@ ant because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study enrolled in 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a placebo ( pseu@@ dost@@ ems ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid level was under 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of the patients receiving Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) patients who once spent 120 mg twice a day in the last three measurements in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no less than 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
the treatment of chronic hypertension ( including one from the medical history ) have already been led ( including one of the medical records and / or pal@@ sy arthritis ) .
if the serum @-@ acid level is still more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Creative Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ transpl@@ ant@@ agon@@ ists because there are no experiences in organ transpl@@ ants , the application of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular diseases in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended for the treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid medicine , it can occur during the treatment start to a acute g@@ ushing case , because through lowering the serum hard @-@ acid mirror initially can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .

liver disease During the Phase 3 clinical trials were observed , slight damage of the liver ( 3.5 % ) were observed ( 3.5 % ) .
therefore , before the beginning of the Feb@@ r@@ ator treatment and further course , it is recommended to perform a liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was not performed on Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to a rise in the ophy@@ l@@ line ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
in case of test subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with 250 mg 2 x daily with a rise in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not related to a clinical significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ io d / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without having a dose custom@@ ization for Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at or the same active ingredient required .
in a study involving subjects evaluated 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak effect of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous taking of a ta@@ xi@@ um , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , the recording of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) is delayed and a decrease of C@@ max by 32 % , but does not cause any significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not allow adverse reactions from Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when taxes of a vehicle , serving machines or in practice of dangerous actions until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance .
a moderate higher incidence of the test reported cardiovascular disease was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ir@@ in@@ ol group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no col@@ oc@@ ative related to Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at and are reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once reported , are listed below .
diar@@ rhoea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials there were no severe skin extracts or severe floo@@ ding actions .
7 Off@@ ers long @-@ time extension studies have been treated in the open long @-@ term extension studies , including 57 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
during the long @-@ term of long @-@ term renewal studies , events were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all f@@ ebru@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and compet@@ ed in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an ex@@ position period of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the figures .
the following untreated events were either reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of phase 3 for these doses either or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ epl@@ essness , hyp@@ ot@@ es@@ thes@@ ia , rash , skin rash , erectile dysfunction , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in potassium concentration in the blood , decline of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline in the number of white blood cells .
mode of action ur@@ ic acid is the final product of Pur@@ in@@ abolic ism and is based on hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ tic acid .
Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at is a strong , not Pur@@ in sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a Ki @-@ value for in vitro @-@ shirts , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was performed in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients who had the last three monthly certain serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with an en@@ cir@@ cling in@@ value to study beginning of a study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl per day ( n = 10 ) .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed with regard to reducing the serum levels of serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with common used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant prevalence of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily , compared to the treatment with the common dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum @-@ acid mirror to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit during week 2 and maintain permanently above the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dys@@ functional limitation The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the pro@@ curement process of serum concentration in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with heavy kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentr@@ ates ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months of 16 @-@ 24 showed a decrease in demand ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against gyp@@ sy ) .
this was associated with a reduction in gyp@@ sy no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of gyp@@ sum up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage of serum concentration was observed , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma machine of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that this oxid@@ ative metabolism was formed predominantly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ ati@@ o@@ stat@@ u@@ cur@@ cur@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

the average total of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ fold @-@ hour of 7.5 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m g / ml in the group with severe kidney cell function .
12 liver function constra@@ ints After taking multi@@ pl@@ ine doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC with mild ( Chil@@ ean P@@ ug@@ h Classi@@ fication A ) or medium ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Classi@@ fication B ) ) or indirectly ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Classi@@ fication B ) ) , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly compared to test subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes related to AU@@ C of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multi@@ pl@@ oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC with older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , imp@@ air@@ ment of fer@@ til@@ isation For male rats was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ ome and cardi@@ ac ) in the high @-@ dosed group , at about 11 times the exposure of humans found .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ abolic and ur@@ inary composition , and considered not relevant to clinical use as a result .
it was found that f@@ ebru@@ ux@@ e@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertili@@ zing and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were approximately at 4.@@ 3 times of human exposure , mother@@ ly tox@@ icity , came down with a lowering of the up@@ lifting capacity and a development delay with the offspring of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are ro@@ ared ) in women after men@@ opause , which is a risk of low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not take up after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and Vitamin D3 are already used in other drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than in those who were written exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) .
furthermore , the company also submitted data that contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose is equivalent to the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain@@ s of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive apparatus such as abdominal pain , dy@@ ul@@ ence ( diarrhea ) , ul@@ cers ( bladder problems ) , so@@ aked abdom@@ en ( low stomach problems ) and sour cream .
in patients with some ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other ingredients may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be applied in disorders of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or taking drugs ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications have exactly follow to decrease the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the emergence of the day . • Pati@@ ents should not let the tablet be crushed before the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. P@@ ep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty only be given under special attention ( see Section 4.3 ) .
public responses such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ kers , were reported in patients under taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( some were these severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor will therefore attention to all signs and symptoms that refer to possible anti @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patients are to be pointed out in the occurr@@ ence of symptoms or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or a new or ref@@ using so@@ aring the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse reactions seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the onset of symptoms that refer to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions can be continued to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , rarely ( after market introduction ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and involving complications , ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to indicate the clu@@ sion of a bis@@ phosph@@ onic therapy in patients who require a ja@@ w surgery that dimin@@ ishes the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rate of the ja@@ w .
clinical assessment due to the treated physician is crucial for the treatment planning with each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients are supposed to take care of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet to the next morning after they have noticed their sec@@ rec@@ y .
they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking an intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the week@@ day week .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the result of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually contam@@ inated medicines that occurred clin@@ ically relevant interaction .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither to use during pregnancy nor of lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at can be detected no indication on direct effects regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients who have transpl@@ ant@@ ated a kidney or liver , to prevent a shock of tran@@ splan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation , with the use of ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients where transpl@@ ants was cancelled after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , how often a new organ transpl@@ ant or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , shorter studies have been performed in 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and examined , like Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

in patients with some ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro eyel@@ id antibiotics ( such as Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in ) or one of the other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) drugs to be taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the same drug may have to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ants , should make this medication or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune supp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dose ; settings of formulation or regime should only be performed under the eng@@ m@@ ating control of one in the transpl@@ ant medicine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dos@@ is@@ adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of de@@ formation and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; recommendations
after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us level mirror should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks to change .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure measured as valley level , with both formulation and kidney transpl@@ ant@@ aneous patients are comparable .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us level mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in direct tran@@ splan@@ ted phase .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first post @-@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate for the production of in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application for the supp@@ ression of transpl@@ antation must be calculated ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft transpl@@ antation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose custom@@ iz@@ ations can be later required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ising the patient after the transpl@@ antation .
dose recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ antation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dose recommended by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf have a gra@@ ft receptor of twice daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily taking of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , this change@@ over in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transpl@@ antation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once a day the treatment must begin with the transpl@@ antation of transpl@@ antation of transpl@@ antation of transpl@@ antation .
cardi@@ transpl@@ ant For adult patients who have been converted on Ad@@ vag@@ raf is an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once in the morning .
other transpl@@ ant@@ agon@@ ers Al@@ though there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung cancer , pan@@ kre@@ - and dar@@ ing transpl@@ ant patients in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transpl@@ ant@@ lers in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood@@ lines in the targeted area can be needed in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function , the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular provision of the serum @-@ cre@@ atine @-@ inspec@@ tions , a calculation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ dia and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf At the transition from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ridge to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in the thorough@@ bred The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of absor@@ bing and toler@@ ability in individual cases under random sampling of thorough@@ bred T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us level mirror during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level mirror by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also refer to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ age custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ os@@ itive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us perfection ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf have a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , custom@@ iz@@ ations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State arrived .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the level mirror in the blood is 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us are usually found in full blood during the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent relief therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ op@@ tics were usually used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transpl@@ ants or other side effects , which can occur in a consequence of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dose ; settings of formulation or regime should only be performed under the eng@@ m@@ ating control of one in the transpl@@ ant medicine ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft detection that proved to be re@@ frac@@ tory over other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ent formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions in adult heart transpl@@ ants and transpl@@ ants in childhood , no clinical data are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ent formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction in the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us level in the blood and a we@@ aken effect of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable oils ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other plant breeding agents during a treatment with ad@@ vag@@ raf . ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in blood is offered , because the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed , which therefore also may occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid exposure and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high degree of protection .
if patients who take the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ s such as headache , change of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and bl@@ ur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
da Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hart@@ ley , ret@@ ar@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose , is required in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ osis int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special attention .
the simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable heal@@ ers , known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and reduce blood levels of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirror with the benefit of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism to monitor and adjust the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining even more appropriate concentrations ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction with An@@ tim@@ y@@ kot@@ ika such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , fluor@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiot@@ ic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ili@@ ers ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tik@@ ets showed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal deteri@@ oration .
highly dosed Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute abor@@ tion actions , can increase the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abolic using CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 containing metabolism .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us increases the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a and thereby increase the hormone ex@@ position , is particularly c@@ auti@@ ous in decisions concerning recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time period .
the results of a minor number of examinations on transpl@@ ants provide no indication that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va , increased risk for un@@ wanted events in relation to the process and result of the pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns on event@@ ual harmful effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( especially concerning its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended .

chronic transpl@@ antation , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transpl@@ antation ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly higher ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were converted from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ us ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there came to no acute transpl@@ antation occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transpl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ate was significantly lower in the patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients .
a multi @-@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transpl@@ antation , which received a random@@ ized process T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ ation ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached to achieve the targeted range level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal transpl@@ ant The published clinical results of a mono@@ centr@@ alised study with oral transpl@@ ants showed at 155 patients ( 65 only gut , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 multi@@ vis@@ c@@ ous transpl@@ ants ) under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an updated survival rate of 75 % to 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a lower hem@@ at@@ eness value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid to run rein@@ forcement of metabol@@ ism should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates .
this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abolic in front of the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly about the g@@ all .
for stable patients treated by pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) in relation to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was less than 10 % lower than at Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us level mirror during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .

adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII ) , inn@@ ate blood co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sive disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of application , if Adv@@ ance is used to treat bleeding or preventing blood cells in surgical interventions .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but after a method used as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that was inserted into a gene ( DNA ) that is capable of supporting the creation of the human existence factor VIII .
adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union . Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , however , is manufactured differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by preventing blood cells and surgical interventions .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well rated &quot; was evaluated .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ ore@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to patients ( allergic ) against the human t@@ inn@@ acle factor VIII , maus@@ oleum or ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted a approval for the market of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy judge after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity shall not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. , / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute symptoms are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions an appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ aten .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and feature different semi @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 , of factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved , or if the blood pressure is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be carried out .
the evaluation speed is supposed to be paid according to the patient , where a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
this inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII in Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which were quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is dependent on the largest and other factors within the first 20 ex@@ position .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , re @-@ appear of ( lowest tit@@ ors ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences yet with the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s number of patients were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all un@@ treated with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) calculations ( b ) . the unexpected decrease of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spiegel@@ s entered post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was maintained during the entire period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy @-@ to @-@ moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ate ( ≥ 150 days ) only a patient showed a low In@@ hibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , no of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed harder to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was found after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ate ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients with a total of 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients had previously treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins were analysed by the examination of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend than even a persistent peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise , however , there were no signs or symptoms that refer to an allergic reaction or a hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in the study by several repeated product ex@@ positions .

based on the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to be evaluated as a positive rating , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which is necessary to submit an application of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the approval holder should apply to another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human@@ itarian Assi@@ stance ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company uses its application for approval for the transport of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or soft arrows ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects , surro@@ unds and leans ) .
this is a kind of virus that has genetically modified so that it may carry a gene into the body cells .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been modified that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infections can trigger in human beings .
adv@@ ent in advance could be in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from which non @-@ defective in the human body is made of p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to restore damage DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had tested the answers to the questions related to him , there were still some issues resolved .
based on the assessment of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP was created a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors bring benefits for the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration , as well as the security of the pharmaceutical .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that adv@@ ent in a reliable way can be produced and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , harmful .
the company used the CH@@ MP to be aware of whether the decl@@ aring consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered mode of effect &quot; means that the tablets are so co@@ sted that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by allergy against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ d@@ skin sli@@ pping ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the treatment duration should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be im@@ pressing on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective dimensions were the changes in the s@@ words of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from the patient before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours a diary and rated the symptoms of a standard sc@@ ala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported , about a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a reduction in the symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , an@@ aes@@ th@@ itis , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( insom@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ epl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be sensitive to patients who possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not applied .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer ur@@ inary or v@@ ascular diseases ( hypertension ) , cardiovascular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ function of thy@@ roid ) or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a cereb@@ ral bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted marketing auth@@ orization to the public transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , in the whole thing to swal@@ low ( i.e. without interrup@@ ting it , to break or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data on in@@ fertility and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after closing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin can take off .
after a reduction in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is based on al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and not submit the data to address appropriate recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in occurr@@ ence of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or ampli@@ fication of heada@@ ches ) must be removed .
in treating the treatment of patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ic disorders • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ nese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder cancer or bronze enthusiasm in the an@@ am@@ nese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines have otherwise able to prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the placebo @-@ treated patients , ir@@ respective of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ fertility of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to pseu@@ do @-@ stri@@ ctor properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients , however , should be aware that there may come in very rare cases to a dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ Depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ age ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as A@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and - di@@ lem@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of non @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the expression index P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose @-@ trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of air capacity including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jec@@ tivity or tasks that are associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg there was no increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer , or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S detection .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined using the total co@@ res for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ d@@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in terms of degra@@ dation effect , determined using the nose sli@@ der skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose @-@ trial for Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in 10 days .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was performed using the formulation of healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects were des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin bad .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , to tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , to Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the reprodu@@ ci@@ ox@@ icity , the preventive data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not recognize any special dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its single components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin .
in reproductive @-@ production studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ress / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

for children ages 1 to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml syrup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , bo@@ oting the sleep and the performance in the day ) and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body is used to take the syrup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children are un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptoms number ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symp@@ tom after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us cannot be used in patients who may be overweight ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or one of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization to acquire SP Europe a approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur according to the previous disease and can be stopped after the sound of the symptoms and with their re @-@ appear again .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended during the everyday use of continuous treatment .
clinical relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in addition to which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 in@@ tox@@ icated by A@@ eri@@ us and Alco@@ hol were not intensi@@ fied by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients , however , should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases that can be dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess in very rare cases , which can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with a@@ eri@@ us were reported to patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events encountered more frequently than in placebo was ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect of headache was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and were treated with placebo for 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of non @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al@@ cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple outlets in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of air capacity including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jec@@ tivity or tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the relie@@ ve of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ dity and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire on quality of life in rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated by the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is un@@ counted in equ@@ ology at different forms , and chronic patients could be pro@@ spective .
since the hist@@ am@@ eless factor is an urs@@ ing factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ ous illnesses , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected to improve in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the production of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose inter@@ v@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to Anti@@ hist@@ amine , were excluded from the study .
improvement of the youth up by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients treated patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population was comparable in 4 % of patients receiving a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no reference points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty acid , low @-@ cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not apply to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine studies , with a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quant@@ it@@ ative differences regarding the tox@@ icity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for the reprodu@@ ci@@ ox@@ icity , the preventive data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not recognize any special dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the exac@@ erb@@ ated physician should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are proposed to support the treatment of an infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , you should play a role in diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests .
about 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin restricted and experienced higher sub@@ tre@@ ble load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are restricted , is identical to the children who met@@ abolic normal .
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose @-@ int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ ation or a suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken .
clinical relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in addition to which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not intensi@@ fied when taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in patients with a@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and young people who were given up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question , received a daily disaster dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied to 14 days a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied to over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets conducted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric .
in clinical @-@ phar@@ yn@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not affect any ampli@@ fication of the alcohol induced power , even to an increase of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and young patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the relie@@ ve of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ dity and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire on quality of life in rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets was effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the production of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose inter@@ v@@ alls .
the spread of this restricted met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Caucas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose trial with the Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis which are restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a half @-@ degree period of about 120 hours .
there are no reference points for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable with p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with the recommended doses of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme has not yet been identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is available in type III brown bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene cl@@ amp valve with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once daily put in the mouth to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ari@@ ate must be taken , without dam@@ aging it .
clinical relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in addition to which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with a@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported to patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study that were used up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well documented ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , display signs and EC@@ G intervals .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple outlets in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg there was no increased incidence of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose @-@ trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jec@@ tivity or tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the relie@@ ve of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ dity and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire on quality of life in rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .

there are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray will be taken , without dam@@ aging it .
the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been demonstrated .
the total hardness of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was equal and with@@ drew not significantly from the safety profile in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tray was the organic equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to the company formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. of the Committee on Human Rights and Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company re@@ signed his application for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of the avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and older people to protect influenza , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 to influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine which could cause a strain of influenza , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks when a new strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears that humans can spread themselves easily because human beings have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects parts of the influenza virus in the vaccine as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes human body as body @-@ foreign ) is un@@ unified and used as part of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the extent of clinical data base for the evaluation of security of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA principles for preventive vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in clinical examination and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you wish more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which has an@@ tivir@@ al drugs of the patient previously taken , and the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood has judged that the virus will appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice a day 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs are taken .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ grav@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , the HIV @-@ amount is reduced in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not cure , however , the damage of the immune system can carry out the development of HIV related infections and diseases .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however , without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this medication with low do@@ si@@ red Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines A@@ bo@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with no det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously used no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had suffered a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , the viral load also decreased , however , with the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ agon@@ ists only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors that had been treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ iness :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , there came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks than in patients who received their previous inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be overweight ( allergic ) against Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or one of the other ingredients .
a@@ ck@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are destroyed just as a@@ eg@@ ase and are consumed in high concentrations in the blood health harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who have been diagnosed with diseases , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection that are caused by a relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase has been used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
in general , A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tical amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee set that the benefit of as@@ ut@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not demonstrated .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; since the approval of scientific reasons was only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited of approval for the market share of ag@@ grav@@ ase in the entire European Union .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 , protein inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ thetic p@@ adding of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r should take into consideration the individual viral resistance and the patient &apos;s treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , ash capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ dur@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ kl@@ ets ) , higher doses have to be applied to a@@ it@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for axial capsules is 20 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , Eff@@ ic@@ acy and Security of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ agon@@ ists were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data on in@@ fertility and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of ag@@ grav@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable dishes , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk @-@ reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should not be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that it may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ emia does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV on others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneously an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the specialized information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , and should be monitored in clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glucose syrup is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of treatment for the risk of systemic cor@@ ster@@ oid effects including mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the tri@@ ni@@ otic function weighs ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the dist@@ ortion of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ oma including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medication at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective for a reduced plasma level of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ i@@ at@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are even more low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution with certain other patient groups .
a@@ ck@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported about the onset of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ er@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with medication that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated .
in h@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase of bleeding including spon@@ ge cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
at the time of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , a inflammatory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections develop , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ tor@@ ment is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune supp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , were reported cases by O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width as@@ certain may not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with minor therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with drugs , whose active ingredients are predominantly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma level with a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects of the liver were observed .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of vegetable dishes with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already taken cur@@ rant , the am@@ on@@ av@@ irus can be checked and , if possible to check the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ rant .
a dose custom@@ ization for any of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ at ir@@ ence below ) .
508 % increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the efficacy and un@@ think@@ able of this treatment schem@@ atic .
in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended that a close surveillance is recommended because the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the anta@@ stic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , no dose adjustment is required for the gift of em@@ ir@@ ation in combination with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with con@@ i@@ ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , because the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be hum@@ ili@@ ated .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data allow Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used at the same time , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bar .
when these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be performed , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) from Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in to 193 % and thus to an increase in associated side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with a@@ ase are required to decrease the dose of ri@@ don@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , however , the plasma level of both medicines might be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day resulted in increasing the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on the 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ sil@@ v@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to inter@@ actions together with a@@ ase .
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions , which are associated with these drugs , if they are applied in combination with as@@ ut@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower the plasma level of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ ni@@ di@@ pin , n@@ ni@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ ano@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medication .
simultaneous taking with a@@ ase can increase its plasma concentration and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ations , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study included in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended to use this glucose co@@ ster@@ oids , unless the potential benefit of treatment for the risk of systemic cor@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depend heavily on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive increases of plasma bar with the simultaneous administration of A@@ bo@@ ase .
since Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ire increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medication is not recommended with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
there will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the benefit of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral tra@@ jec@@ tively mus@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is required .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 @-@ fa@@ che .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ i@@ at@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are even more low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as the Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
in the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ inum , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of failure or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods to contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the simultaneous gift of a@@ emia ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied for the mother &apos;s possible risks for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is over for people in the breast milk .
a reproduction study of severe rats which was administered by the in@@ flow in u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , showed an increase in 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation .
the further development of post@@ age , including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive ability , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the un@@ think@@ able of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most related side effects related to the a@@ it@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , rose early and rarely resulted in treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with the in@@ gest@@ ion or other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects origin@@ ate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ants did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ dur@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , assessed by the investig@@ ational agents than in connection with the study medication , were listed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as the treatment of laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of small and fast sub@@ ret@@ inal fat tissue , prolifer@@ ative and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation ( bull ) .
having been treated with 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , only a case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study occurred in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin extracts were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and compet@@ ed spont@@ aneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
in particular , o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose was reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , a inflammatory reaction to as@@ y@@ mp@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of patients treated with PI had been treated twice daily with low do@@ si@@ red Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were treated with patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ red Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of overdose , the patient is able to observe an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .
Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and avo@@ ids the proc@@ essions of viral g@@ ag@@ - and G@@ ag @-@ pol@@ arity with the consequence of a formation un@@ irrit@@ ated , non infectious viral particles .
an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated by acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al hem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r vs. HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans are not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as seen in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ stered treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ sil@@ v@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic could be investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ants did not appeared in treated patients who were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , M@@ 36@@ V , M@@ 46@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M , and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and the extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ le@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients with four @-@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations on :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ative analyses , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ sil@@ v@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ sil@@ v@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / C / M , I@@ 54@@ A / C / M / M / C / M , I@@ 54@@ A / C / M , I@@ 54@@ A / C / M , I@@ 54@@ A / C / M , I@@ 54@@ A / C / M , I@@ 54@@ A / C / M , I@@ 54@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in connection with a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resist@@ ence ) .
conclusions regarding relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations , changes are subject to additional data , and it is recommended to move the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems for analysis of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resist@@ ence , clinical analysis systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ sil@@ v@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resist@@ ence tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ off@@ s ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to interpretation of resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ sil@@ v@@ avi@@ r resist@@ or , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients , a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the ob@@ taining of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders that can affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study ( 100@@ mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ y ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ two ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ in@@ security of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group compared to the period adjusted ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub@@ woofer wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of untreated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
in the same time there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) who ab@@ duc@@ ted N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients had included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
19 B@@ ased on this data should be considered at the treatment of treatment with PI pre @-@ treated children who are considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered &quot; un@@ ble@@ ed &quot; axis . &quot;
after oral administration , the medium duration ( maximum ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as a failure penetration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active ingredients in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ occupied Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of uncertain Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active part in the met@@ ady concentration of the met@@ ady concentration in the Ste@@ ady State of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore medicines that induced CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or in@@ hib@@ itions or sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are required if they are given at the same time with a@@ it@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of a@@ ck@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bi@@ over@@ able than the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and axis capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of ren@@ al kidney problems arise on the elimination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r plasma bricks comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne Aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ vik @-@ cellular Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of this observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
in the present position data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little advice for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial resistance tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ oma test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromosome test of human peri@@ ph@@ eric lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical trials with measurements of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously no significant tox@@ icity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase yet after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity at young , treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate during the control animals as well as the animals treated with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a systematic plasma position , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage while humans were , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and lower skel@@ etal changes were observed that refer to a delayed development .
24 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses have to be applied to a@@ it@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for axial capsules is 20 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with weak or light liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
a@@ ck@@ ase should be set on duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended that a close surveillance is recommended because the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this combination is not known .
the treatment with con@@ i@@ ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , because the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be hum@@ ili@@ ated .
when these drugs are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be performed , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with a@@ ase are required to decrease the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available .
the serum concentration of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ ni@@ di@@ pin , n@@ ni@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ ano@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medication .
in a clinical study included in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ inum , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of failure or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ thin@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the possible risks for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of severe rats which was administered by the in@@ flow in u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation .
the un@@ think@@ able of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of overdose , the patient is able to observe an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .
an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated by acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al hem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the ob@@ taining of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the treatment optim@@ isation should be considered to be considered expected to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered &quot; un@@ ble@@ ed &quot; axis . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of uncertain Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active part in the met@@ ady concentration of the met@@ ady concentration in the Ste@@ ady State of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore medicines that induced CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or in@@ hib@@ itions or sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are required if they are given at the same time with a@@ it@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the impact of ren@@ al dys@@ functional disorder on the elimination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be small .
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne Aden@@ ome with dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people twice daily gift from 1200 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ zel@@ ul@@ ary Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , out of the present ex@@ position data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little instructions for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial resistance tests ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ oma test , micro@@ processor test of human peri@@ ph@@ eric lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ on@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity at young , treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate during the control animals as well as the animals treated with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r animals .
these results indicate that the metabolism of the metabolism are not fully developed , so that Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , ash capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should follow as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the in@@ gest@@ ion of the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for axial solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the single and low dose @-@ kn@@ uck@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups may be avoided .
although a dose custom@@ ization for Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for being necessary , an application of as@@ cer@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene glyco@@ sides , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is a solution for infants and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ or of the metabolism of this drug may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should not be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ emia does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV on others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
a@@ ck@@ ase should be reduced to duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in h@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase of bleeding including spon@@ ge cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .

the cream is dil@@ uted before bed@@ time to the affected skin areas , so that it stays sufficient for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of patients treated . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , in which patients were treated for six weeks and treated Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times per week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in total 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area the total reduction rate of 66 % to 52 % were treated with placebo in all four main studies . • The results of the two trials to bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma showed a total reduction of 66 % to 80 % compared with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips or hair attachment was not examined .
local skin actions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take back in general during therapy or the reactions come back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the symptoms of the patient or for the sever@@ ity of local skin actions , a treatment break of several days can be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be evaluated after the treatment of treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates are available from more than 36 months after treatment , with super@@ fic@@ ated bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , other suitable treatments should be drawn into consideration .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experiences yet , the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , a lower probability of response to the is@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip@@ stick area within the Li@@ pp@@ en@@ r@@ ots .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ic places outside the facial and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application purpose , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin actions occur frequently , but these reactions take normally in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after placing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin actions causing large un@@ eas@@ iness or very strong , treatment can be exposed to a few days .
out of the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 entries had a lower healing rate . patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

the acci@@ dental recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 m@@ g. was norm@@ alized in Hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , an increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected .
in 3 l@@ ashing relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete balance of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ od is superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in total , 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients with in@@ doors . this was 20 % of the 105 treated with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI :

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the dos@@ ing doses ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum systemic recording of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream caused by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ als 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time half @-@ time period after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates a pro@@ longed re@@ tention of the medication in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the result of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low to top@@ ographic application of patients aged 6 - 12 years of low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fic@@ er bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .

in the study mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by reducing its effect in relation to reducing the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in the case of children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in the urine decreased by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion station .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be sensitive to patients who possibly react strongly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other ingredients ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) is every year all new information , possibly known , check and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients receiving Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a approval for the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ val , ov@@ ary of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ til@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial input rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient is wearing this , all 15 minutes in individual steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any interaction , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be monitored closely and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment , in the revival facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution in applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , has to be careful due to the theoretical increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ thesis ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be accounted for and / or reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction occurred .
in case of single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are taken drop , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering .
in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred , can be resum@@ ed .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate that has occurred before the previous reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ ference with intra@@ cellular recording of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exported over the breast milk over the breast milk is recommended , it is not recommended during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse reactions in clinical trials were ordered mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during the Phase 3 period or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tra@@ cts and lungs , in addition , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ a , breathing , and facial expressions ( see section 4.4 ) .
children &apos;s un@@ wanted drug @-@ effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe contra@@ cting form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , have been reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version , whereby it usually came to a ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version during one month ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a pre @-@ departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not det@@ ectable with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ hon@@ cip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients where it has never been to server version .
patients with lacking low @-@ body levels showed a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ ers a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n was observed .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal up to low @-@ neutral production efficiency on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ ide activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired drugs actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse events typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the en@@ m@@ ist therapy is located in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of acute sub@@ strate and preventing a further accumulation to recovery of enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells taken into the ly@@ an@@ os@@ omes most likely about man@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - receptor recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study included the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recruited for an open label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated an improvement in lung function and the sal@@ inity upon which is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and a group of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the expected pro@@ curement FE@@ V is not significantly significantly and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a non @-@ atomic treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear apost@@ asy of the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was found that remained constant until the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease mani@@ pulation between the patients suffering from using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes of the S@@ hou@@ l@@ ard AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
there was a one @-@ year @-@ old open Phase 2 study conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients who were examined at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe de@@ formation form and 4 with the mean age form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n .
in several patients , a size growth rate ( n = 7 ) was detected after the Z Score for these age group the younger patients with the severe de@@ formation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean failure rate , whereas in the older patients with severe de@@ formation form only limited or even no progress in the cogn@@ itive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , investigations were carried out to the co@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ atic on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a represented alternative in patients that represent difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of this two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent to .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug is being updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those in older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who had not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have already received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any treatment .
to decrease effects , the patient should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and folic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , before or after the administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally an &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid level ) .
in patients whose blood image changes or where certain side effects occur , the treatment should be increased , removed or reduced the dose .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ ed down the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer lasting effects in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not yet received chemotherapy against their disease .
treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer resulted in the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( other medicines against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival period with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients who were not diagnosed with cancer cells , during which A@@ lim@@ ta caused longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative medicine .

AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al , advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except during superior @-@ driving epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin transactions must be given a day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift , as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses folic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third load cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed before each gift should be created a full blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose of dose must take place under rec@@ ti@@ res@@ ation of the Na@@ dir@@ s of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre @-@ curing therapy cycles .
after recovery the patients must be treated according to notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are treated for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
should patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ 3 degree ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the treatment must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient need the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ ing , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue at the onset of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that patients suffering from 65 years of age or over 65 years of age , an elevated side risk @-@ risk of patients in the age of 65 .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ adequate data on in@@ fertility and effectiveness .
in clinical trials with a Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , there were no dose custom@@ iz@@ ations required for all patients recommended Dos@@ age custom@@ iz@@ ations .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance from under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bor@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limits and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the upper limit value ( with absorption of liver tissue ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver tissue ) not specifically studied in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ ck@@ - marking supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ es once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - zy@@ ten@@ ds has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ es , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as it observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2 ) .
lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was dis@@ counted when a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ eved with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , folic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y- lac@@ tic measure to reduce tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ atic logi@@ stical ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , to avoid breast cancer ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ term evaluation time for at least 5 days before the therapy , and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including D@@ eh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid @-@ collection in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion of the path@@ o@@ xed treatment should be o@@ wed .
5 severe cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of shadow fuels ( excluding yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial of reproductive ability is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted , advice on sperm mot@@ ions .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ atic logi@@ stical ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a dimin@@ ished p@@ em@@ et al ex@@ cre@@ tion result in a reduced increase of effects .
therefore be careful when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , should be avoided since the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens of 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the re@@ ac@@ tionary potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be mixed with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral antibodies and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ last@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient &apos;s du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation .
there are no data for use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed at pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected in an application during pregnancy severe birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , demanding and after careful breakdown of use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shafts of reproductive ability is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment beginning , advis@@ ing on the sperm convention .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , fet@@ ish@@ able diet .
patients who take all@@ i are taking no weight loss after 12 weeks , should take care of their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , some fats can not be abol@@ ished in the diet , making it a quarter of the fats connected to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had all@@ i 60 mg per year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study involving all@@ i patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( winds ) with chair crisis , chair w@@ rest@@ ation , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients who are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ in ( for prevention of transpl@@ antation in transpl@@ ant patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
it cannot be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which non @-@ sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and with pregnant or lac@@ ing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited of approval for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ ish@@ able diet .
all@@ i must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data regarding efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ated , with elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of dosage is necessary .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other ingredients • Equ@@ al treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ lac@@ tation ( see section 4.6 ) • Additional treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or fat @-@ rich nutrition .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can occur with an improved met@@ abolic control , patient should consult a pharmac@@ euticals against diabetes , prior to the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adapted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines against hypertension or higher cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if the dose of this drug must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional s@@ essive @-@ prevention activities in order to prevent the oral contra@@ cep@@ tion in the event of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study at inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed in a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ in plasma screens .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta car@@ otene in the standard range remained .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time to take a suppl@@ ementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a disposable dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed at a limited number of healthy volunteers , which simultaneously received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as absorption of dro@@ wned fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
the common areas are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ side effects , which were detected after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known , because these events were voluntary reported by a population of uncertain size .
+ It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i to conver@@ se in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal effects may result .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , excluding significant clinical findings .
at the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at revisions were either no side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on Human and Animal , based on humans and animal can be derived from a rapid recovery of systemic effects that are due to the li@@ pas@@ eving properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is used in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente Bin@@ ding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ al and pan@@ kre@@ atic lights .
clinical trials was derived that 60 m@@ g. of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled trials with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 measures the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ ish@@ able diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as proportion of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
at the wa@@ ist size , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value of 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , the therapeutic dosage could not met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at in plasma only spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study involving adi@@ p@@ ous patients who have been administered minimal system@@ ically stressed dose , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after folding of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) were identified , which presented nearly 42 % of the total pl@@ as@@ concentration concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ated potential and reprodu@@ ci@@ st@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data can &apos;t recognize any special danger to humans .

Alo@@ xi is used with chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are severe trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapist , excessive trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of an chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or excessive trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapist , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared with 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapist , 81 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared with 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the market of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ o@@ idal chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and vomiting of nausea and vomiting in moderately em@@ o@@ idal chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rec@@ tal cancer , patients should be monitored using an@@ am@@ orous ob@@ itu@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is provided with the benefit of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to avoid such an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists gift , Alo@@ xi is neither to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prehistoric studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five evaluated chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ an analysis ( D@@ ont Eth@@ ason and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ eit@@ eth@@ n@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Cor@@ iti@@ ine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not available , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is necessary to be considered by the treated doctor .
in clinical trials the most common effects were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least probably stood with Alo@@ xi in the context of heada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of excess ine@@ actions and reactions at the administration site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; no dose @-@ response relationships were observed .

in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received an moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received , that was given to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients compared to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderately em@@ ulated chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. effects of ker@@ os@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift , a slow elimination of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale period of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 per g / kg in relation and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean medium ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
derived from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , the total ex@@ position of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron achieved a total value of 0.@@ 75 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max after one @-@ one intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous period was 0,@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % of the kidneys will be eliminated , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron more than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effects on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 can be involved in smaller measurements , the CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 can be involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made some 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous placebo injection , the total body number 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in case of patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale elimination rate and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient on the maximum human exposure exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of these clinical trials showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which can be involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation , and extend the expansion period .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose of the therapeutic exposure during humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ mas ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , tri@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , however not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi used for a unique application , the relevance of these results are very small .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ ist Immun@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion , in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C the drug was recommended to use Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is to be similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ az@@ en@@ sely ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference phar@@ ma &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ persistent ) hepatitis C ( caused by a virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ opic survey the liver tissue has damages , also the values of the liver disease Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was produced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the effect .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data before the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) .
in the study enrolled in patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus found in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document , which led the CH@@ MP to the recommendation to fail the approval for the market ?
furthermore , concerns have been expressed , that data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the market @-@ market drugs .
the number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke on the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting up the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease was re@@ amed up with more patients than in the reference cancer ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from this , the trial used in the study on how far the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to treatment of im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a skin infection ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting ) , depreciation and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resi@@ sten@@ te Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because alarm go against this kind of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was taken after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar contacts : when the results of both studies were taken up with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients received both groups on treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused by the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ uba ( vain cav@@ ities in body tissues ) or of infection that have been proven demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the client site .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of al@@ ar@@ go over the short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections are over against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ary , depreciation or paraly@@ zed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with which there are no improvement within two to three days , should be considered even once and an alternative therapy is considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ isation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment was canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully caught and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections , which M@@ RSA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients suffering from infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) was in@@ sufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected site occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of retin@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved in human application to ste@@ ady skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 In the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be based on a smooth skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , dos@@ ages are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction elast@@ icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fine / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated , and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiot@@ ic .
in deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding is continued , termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued , is between the benefit of a breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the al@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , al@@ ar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration centre , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ opilot ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial cells of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
the data indicates that the Bin@@ y@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ Bin@@ ding area and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred centre .
by binding on this connection of inhibit@@ ing P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
in case of the local pre@@ val@@ ency of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some infectious forms , a consultation by experts should be targeted .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of strains with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was applied 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be a day under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were gained .
the sample took place in days 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic recording in people after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ low on 200 c@@ m2 = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabol@@ ism In vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily con@@ veyed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro @-@ check on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse lymp@@ h @-@ test or in cultures of human peri@@ ph@@ eric blood cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither at male nor female rats signs of reduced fertili@@ zing with oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby achieving an estimated exposure of up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of people ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) :
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study in rats were observed at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development sto@@ x@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and maternal tox@@ icity .

ambient is used to protect Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not yet immune to these two diseases .
ambient temperature is used as part of a two doses existing vaccine , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , ambient sounds can only be used while immun@@ isation is a lower risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the two doses can be reduced to an end of two doses .
if a ref@@ res@@ ent dose is required against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines affect the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , &quot; which can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ds since 1996 and has been approved by Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same illnesses , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix Children are administered under three doses existing vacc@@ ines .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as proof of the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ thesis one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injec@@ tions .
ambient temperature was between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the ambient temperature of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a 6 @-@ month gap between the injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache pain , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ isation ( ti@@ redness ) and irrit@@ ability .
ambient may not be sensitive to patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a approval for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic m@@ ati@@ zation with ambient ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a ref@@ res@@ sion is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combined fuel .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C surface anti@@ gen observed in accordance with the combination of anti @-@ hepatitis C surface anti@@ gen ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , which are addressed to a hepatitis A vaccine , as they are not protected from immun@@ ological memory as well as in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As in all injection practices , for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring always should be available immediately .
if a faster protection against Hepatitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation of hepatitis B is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ E and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injec@@ tion or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccination result , this injec@@ tor should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can in@@ jected an exception of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
when ambi@@ rix in the second year of a separate injection process , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ing , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , was given the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ og@@ lob@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ og@@ lob@@ es must be assumed that perhaps no adequate immun@@ ity is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gastro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ e- and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ines .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccine at the age of 1 and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the toler@@ ability of ambient sounds compared to the 3 @-@ cans combined fuel .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ism at a calculation basis per vaccination dose ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 50,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the test after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects were given to the ambient sounds , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ism was comparable high ( i.e. about the total vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects were compared to 3@@ 6.2 % compared with the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans combined fuel ) .
the frequency of pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ism was low and comparable to , which was observed after administration of combination with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old imports was comparable to the occurr@@ ence of local actions and general conditions in the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group with 360 ELISA units , formal in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was observed .
however , in the 6- until 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with ambient sounds a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported .
the proportion of imports that reported over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination schem@@ as with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen reported was statistically significant .
in clinical trials that were carried out at Imp@@ air@@ ingen at the age of 1 and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 ab@@ orted dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study performed at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined fuel with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was ext@@ end@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose imp@@ f@@ material .
the immune response shown in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , Imp@@ air@@ ings received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ines with a combination of 360 ELISA units and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambient temperature in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immun@@ o@@ gens observed in this study was comparable to that , which after vaccination of 3 cans with a combined fuel , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was observed in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
a clinical study in 12@@ - to including 15 year old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ inated in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ines .
if the first dose ambi@@ rix in the second year of life is combined with a combined seal , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vacc@@ ines , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical trial which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed the current formulation similar to ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ement rates such as the previous formulation .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred through viral food and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as in the waters of water through wast@@ e@@ water pollution .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that possibly need a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is infected with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uns@@ afe or ill / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver , or cause symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be con@@ veyed .
if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction may have occurred through it@@ ching skin extracts , short@@ ness or swelling of facial or tongue . • If you have oc@@ cured any allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has severe infection with fever / has .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the equivalent of the second vaccination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will give you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of an effective hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective stock will usually be given one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before the vaccination series .
sometimes , ambi@@ rix is in@@ jected with heavy blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in@@ jected into the muscle . if you / your child is weak@@ ened because of a disease or a treatment in your body &apos;s own defense , or when you / your child moves forward / down .
ambient may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can &apos;t be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how much reaction to vaccination is .
21 Do you take your doctor if you / your child may take more medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without en@@ roll@@ ment ) or if you have received / your child recently / has been given or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or that is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at ambient ambient , it should be vacc@@ inated on separate places and different lim@@ bs .
if ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficient .
usually ambient women is not administered , except it is urg@@ ently needed , that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you already have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 p@@ enn@@ ed cans ) : • pain or complaints at the input station or redness • Imp@@ act of irrit@@ ability • heada@@ ches • loss of appetite •
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 p@@ enn@@ ed cans ) : • swelling on injection place • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
further side effects , the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or individual imp@@ unity of hepatitis A and hepatitis B were very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 imported doses ) are reported :
these include locally limited or extensive extracts , the it@@ ching can be or bul@@ lock @-@ shaped , swelling of eyes and facial , difficult breathing , or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure and loss of consciousness .

23 Do you tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects that are not specified in this package series .
ambient temperature is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packages to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been announced since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the market , CH@@ MP grants the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambient temperature remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medication is limited due to the low patient ex@@ position .
Ammon@@ ites can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ton@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ i@@ ac concentrations ) in the history .
ammon@@ ium is divided - split up on several individual doses to meals - s@@ lu@@ cked , mixed with food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ite was not compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ dost@@ em , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also result in loss of loss , a degra@@ dation of acid in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid re@@ tention , fla@@ w@@ ess , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , irregular body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ium is effective in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary life cycle to high ammon@@ i@@ ak@@ ages .
Ammon@@ ola was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the self @-@ ten@@ der@@ ment of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme had already manifested in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late manifested form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which is manifested after the first life month ) there is an indication of the use if in the an@@ am@@ orous , hyper@@ ton@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ low problems , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration the protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthes@@ iz@@ asis or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ z@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ c@@ cin@@ at@@ syn@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ low problems , as an risk for the creation of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets enter not immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with contra@@ sting heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium re@@ prim@@ and eco @-@ formation , only with caution .
since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate an young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came into a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal displacement and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients underwent an adverse event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of these adverse events , it was assumed that they were not with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in connection .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ do@@ zation occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old small child with a good dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which showed dos@@ ing doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active link con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ating glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is separated by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram it is dro@@ wned in sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early release and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease led themselves to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analogue to death within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ position ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , protein reduced che@@ at and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate in post @-@ party ( however within the first life month ) diagnosed disease to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with the time with many of mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifested form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous scar@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with a hyper@@ ton@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet was the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in nut@@ riti@@ ous healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablets form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bet@@ ia , after varying doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate was det@@ ectable in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three individual doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations have been rated five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is divided within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 up to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets or patients with gor@@ ging problems ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ en@@ proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthes@@ iz@@ asis or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ z@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ ist were exposed before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ines of the brain rin@@ d .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tions of excess .
based on examinations on the ex@@ position of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram liquid sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentrations have been detected by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
the small measuring sco@@ op 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient must have received the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can &apos;t separate the stu@@ ds of waste products , which can not separate after consumption of proteins in the body .
when you examined laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you may have AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs .
during a breast@@ feeding you can &apos;t take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could go over in breast milk and hurt your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , flav@@ ours , desc@@ ending of obe@@ dience , dis@@ ori@@ enti@@ veness , memory defic@@ its and a wor@@ sen@@ ing existing neuro@@ logical states were observed .
if you want to determine one of these symptoms , get immediately with your doctor or with the emergency of your hospital to an appropriate treatment in connection .

you should also take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same individual outlets or via a stomach f@@ ist@@ le ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( hose that is run through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a measuring sco@@ op over the edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Ex@@ ample the recommended number of measuring sco@@ op gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the breast basket with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( an abnormal measuring value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ ox in any of some gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) compared to conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I .
while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - with preventing new events ( deaths , heart failure or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in terms of all indicators as well as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox should not be used in patients , possibly sensitive to patients ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other ingredients .
it must also be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as with people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an eligible replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the market share of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency relief , or when an early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by a in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in further sequence a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased , and in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by a in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of the intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously before application .
once the ACT value is worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al ren@@ al function of kidney ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which should be subjected to a PCI ( whether using bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient for testing and the ACT lasts 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval was the ACT value 5 minutes from the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low molecular Hep@@ arin .
• known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood @-@ risk problems due to a disorder of hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial disorder . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
although in PCI @-@ patients with Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine , most of the blood cells occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ cture can occur in patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle everywhere .
in patients who will take War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards R@@ atio ) should be used to ensure that the value after placing the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again reached the existing level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of antibodies ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ aggreg@@ ates ) can be assumed that these active ingredients are increasing the risk of blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ates or anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators , clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ akers are regularly to control in any case .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate in relation to the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development involving de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were randomised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ ar@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups of compar@@ ative groups , women as well as in patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease that does not have enough insulin to control the glucose ( sugar ) in blood or cannot process insulin .
insulin injec@@ table differs very margin@@ ally of human insulin , and the change means that it operates faster and a shorter response time has a short @-@ effective human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glyc@@ em@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at insulin pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amounted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be sensitive to patients ( allergic ) against insulin or one of the other ingredients , or in patients that suffer from a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH to grant approval from A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is available as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the sphere of abdominal wall or delta angle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ fusion due to continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal pain .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , insulin needs can be reduced with a limitation of liver function .
each change of real strength , the mark ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin requirements .
3 A adequate dosage or the demol@@ ition of a treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ induced diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ a ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient on an other insulin type or an insulin should be made under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the response time of a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia depends on the effects of insulin @-@ used insulin and can therefore change the treatment schem@@ atic .
the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , angi@@ ot@@ ine @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ph@@ al , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ actic , and sul@@ phon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ ers , such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ders are weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies in the reproductive @-@ ox@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ on@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ kind regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if insulin enters into the human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in the breast milk , it is still res@@ or@@ ated after oral application .

after a Glu@@ k@@ agon@@ ism , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the urine cause of severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the real time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes ( insulin @-@ ) insulin @-@ based dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , an increase in propor@@ tion@@ ed glucose effects , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a proportional increase in the glucose levels , just like human insulin .
insulin injec@@ tor has twice as fast active effects as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose effects of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
