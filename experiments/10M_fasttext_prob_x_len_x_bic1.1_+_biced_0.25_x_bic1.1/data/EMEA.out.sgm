<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European public distribution report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) evaluated the study conducted in order to achieve recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package format (also part of the EPAR) or turn to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and talking, hallucinations (listening or sight of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a psychological illness, in which patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal high mood) alternate with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to severe manic episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to rapid control of trouble or behavioral problems, if the oral ingestion of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution for inserting or the melting tablets in patients can be used, which the swallow of tablets are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who also take other medicines at the same time, the same as Ablify should be mined, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably affects the receptors for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitter seems to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine faced a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Ablify to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo who had been restrazed to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectioning solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which had been associated with increased agitation, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms of patients using a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies through to investigate how the body reprimates the melting tablets and the solution for depositing (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, the Abilify had received doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms as patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was effective in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the resuming manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered to an existing treatment in addition to 74 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses decreased more effective than placebo as placebo and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), fatigue hypersecretion (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee on humanist tenant (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify at treatment of schizophrenia and from mid-severe to severe manic episodes in patients who had been mainly manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of trouble and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disturbance, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">Recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, depending on meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of these patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justifies this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 sheet is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of antipsychotic therapy, even with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased superficidal risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, cardiac disease), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which can be applied for hypotonia (diehydratation, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure medications) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskies: in clinical trials, which one year or less, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol in Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyskies, it should be drawn into consideration to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If one patient's signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be involved in patients with seizures in the anamorous or with states that are treated with caution with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease patients had treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to unwanted prunting events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazican or hyperosmolarcoma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk estimations for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polymers, Polyurie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to Comorbidalities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as side effect is observed, respectively of unhealthy life, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore similar dosing reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the joint application of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common use of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, must have similar effects, and therefore similar dosing reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage at the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethoran / 3-methodological morphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethoran).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be given to inform their doctor if she will pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data security for humans and due to the reproductive studies in the animal, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned before, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were considered possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the downside below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total low incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripizol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study about 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients was under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term accounting for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 15.7% were treated for placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters were found, yielded no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">The CPI (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asympatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the adverse events that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted prunting events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or unintentional overdosients with Aripiprazol were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a pathologic with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely to use hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma processor.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripizol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance about the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect is mediated on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity for Dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenders and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg, the Positons emissions tomography showed a dosing-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the grid.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled trials (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-controlled trial, 52% of the proportion of patients who were involved in study medication was similar to study medication in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depression-scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in return rate caused by 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia, the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapiology studies with flexible and mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over 3 weeks to reduce excessive effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapeutical study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed no superior effectiveness over placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapists for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I-I, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over a week 3 and a replacement effect that was comparable to the lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disturbance, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks are not performed on lithium or Valproate monol a superior effectiveness in reducing manipulation in comparison to the monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 weeks in a placebo-controlled study over 74 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase during a stabilisation phase during a stabilisation phase on Randomisation, Aripiprazol showed a placebo in relation to the prevention of a bipolar repay, predominantly with the prevention of a bipolar response in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazol, catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal-life period is close to approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol at extensive metabolisation over CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as an pharmacokinetic examination schizophrenic patients showed no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation on pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the impact of smoking at the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe cardioid failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose of trial in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to pull out impacts on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive oxicity, genotoxicity and to the channel potential, the preclinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed merely with dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure during humans, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of dosing toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulating and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks from 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (which is 10 times the medium Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>

<seg id="98">However, in the human Gall found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11x of the medium Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical Maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactose-hydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased blood sugar, increased phosphor in blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dychagie, blamines, burning, dry mouth, sweet tooth, loose chair, ecophagitis, pain in the lower, sores in mouth, orderly pain, rektal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest pain, weakness of muscle pain, muscle pain, muscle pain, muscle pain, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the ghosts, muscle weakness Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Amhelplessness 1 The incidence of excess-sensitivity will be calculated based on a final in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and it was not established with such events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubuli ingredient that encourages the coagulation of microtubuli in the Tubular Indian and stabilization by inhibiting their depolysis.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubular network that is essential for the vitale interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin is mediated to the endothelial components in endothelial cells and in part of vitro studies, albumin promotes the presence of albumaxel's transport by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendotheliale transport by the gp-60-albuminrereceptor is conveyed and due to the albuminbic protein SPARC (reatted protein acidic rich in cysteine) is a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single-blind studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of the patients had an adverse general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had viscerated metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy, 27% had only a adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% for metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-line therapy are laid down.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral Neuropathy 3 degree during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to ban on baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and still is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute inputs of Abraxane with a dose of 80-375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The linear exposition (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration on multi-phase phases took place.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a wide range of extravascularized distribution and / or crossover network of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-quality Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift higher (43%) than after a solvent paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue stories, paclitaxel is primarily associated with 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean drug was 4% of the total total dose with less than 1% of metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal cleance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, over the age of more than 75 years, only few data are available, because only 3 patients of these age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine, which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and the same active ingredient (also called "reference helper").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood levels used in connection with a blood transfusion of complications, if the procedure is not possible prior to the procedure, and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be led under the supervision of a doctor, which has an experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be done by the patient or of his caregiver, if they have a reasonable guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per decilences in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are given prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency consists, and ice-energy, should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who have received chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anemia can cause anaemia caused by a erythropoietinmangel or thus, that the body is not sufficient on the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that has been brought into a gene (DNA) that it adapts to the formation of epoxetine alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration in a vein in the frame of a main study with 479 patients who had caused by kidney problems caused by the reference to the reference.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks before Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a vein before being transferred either to seseamed or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the study period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which effects of Eprex / Erypo had been investigated at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy alone.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who had caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed, were calculated in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems), such as sudden, stubble headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients that possibly insensitive (allergic) against epochetine alfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, since further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been achieved in accordance with the regulations of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the seamed, will provide information on the safety of the medicine, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except at pädiatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6,8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Angiogenic symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical development and disease advocates are required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to variability between patients, patients can occasionally be observed with individual hemoglobin values above or under the hemogglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) should be reached to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobster is more than 2 g / dmmol / l (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the long-term hemoglobster value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetine-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored in order to ensure that epochetine alfa must be used in the lowest-approved dose which is necessary to control anaemia and anesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher adverse requirements than patients with which the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher adverse events than patients with which the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin value, at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the recurrent number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value, the dose of 150 g / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the recurrent number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the output value, the dose should be raised to 300 / kg three times a week.</seg>

<seg id="401">If the hemoglobster value is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the recurrent number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value, a response to the epetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the pre-supply unit of ≥ 4 blood conservatives is required, seseamed in a dose of 600, / kg body weight should receive twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>

<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovasculular events were observed when erythropoese stimulate active ingredients (ESA) with a haemoglob- target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) were given.</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit, which is due to the gift of epoxins, when the hemoglobin concentration is increased to control of anesysymptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>

<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dosage must be adjusted to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapist-related anemia - dose customization with the aim of holding the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit risk reduction under the participation of their patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for larger elective orthopedic surgery, if possible, before the epetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values), probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretions about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the recommended dose is tied in urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body cleance is independent from the dose of 5.04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of interest rate acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced cleance by cytochrom-P450-enzyme systems metabolic substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolic, and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal cleance of the oldonic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It emerges that a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function can down to a Kreatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min, no dose customization of the zinc deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because of heavy renal problems (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-circular intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, individual doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC contains 6times of the recommended ex-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that is equivalent to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, which corresponds to the 7x of the Human-therapeutic exposure, which is equivalent to AUC).</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European public distribution report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee for Humanist Protection (CHMP) evaluated the study conducted to proceed to recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not indicated in patients (a diabetic medicine). • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonylharnstoff or insulin, the present dose of the sulphonylharnant or insulin can be retained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of the sulphurylene oxide or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better tolerated and the blood sugar level is decreasing, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetone in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonylharnstoff, in addition, they received either acetone or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar levels have been lowered with application of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study the effect of the additional gift from Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonylharnstoff in a lowering of the HbA1c values increased by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving the Actos in addition to insulin measures resulted in lowering the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were blurred vision, infections of the upper respiratory tract (common cold), weight gain and hypothesia (decreased sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acetone may not be used in patients who possibly react sensitively (allergic) to Pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoazican (high viscosity levels - acidity level - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos was used as an alternative to a monotherapy (in the sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission distributed the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to provide approval from Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and bear on one side the markings "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient to inadequate and inappropriate for which metformin due to contraindications or intolerance is inappropriate (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The application of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years are not available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are threatened by the presence of at least a risk factor (e.g. earlier, heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose progressively.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or ecdema, especially those with reduced kardious reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and eyelids, if Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovasculular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced progressive macrovasculine disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard division) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased, the liver amounts are as soon as possible again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developing symptoms that indicate a heavian dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, upper-condition, tiredness, loss of appetite, and / or dark Harn, are the liver values to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon is continued, should be led to the preliminary parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dosing-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can stir in fatty deposits and in some cases with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemogelution in therapy with Pioglitazone, a reduced reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by about 3-4.1%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction of hemoglobin um 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who received Pioglitazon as oral or triple combination therapy with a sulphonylhard foam or as a double combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, under the treatment with Thiazolidinons, including Pioglitazon, was reported to report an appearance or worsening of a diabetic macular dema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödees, however, should be aware of the possibility of maculaödems, when patients should report on disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic statement should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In summary analysis of undesired events concerning bone mares from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated freight rate was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were compared to 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if one patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs, the treatment is prescribed (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the analysis of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocousins and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolic from these enzymes, such as oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-reducer inhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with fibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazone to increase 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to due to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the parent and reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fine growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (derived from the data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the index of lentil, as they are observed in other hypoglycemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT margin over three times the upper limit of the standard range is frequently common to placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under Metformin or Sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing advanced macrovasculine disease was the incidence of severe cardiac failure under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely over heart failure under Pioglitazon has been reported but more frequently if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamorous.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of undesired events concerning bone mares from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PROACTIVE study, fractures appeared at 44 / 870 (5.1%) who were treated with Pioglitazon patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work with activating specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until the aftermath of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be calculated by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite the three-month optimization phase with insulin, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c value declined by 0.45% compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week investigation into type 2 diabetic states.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while under Metformin and Gliclazid decreased.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postpondial increased triglyceride level, this also improved via a effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as on the heavian triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovasculular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovasculine disease in groups were randomised to receive either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorated, with the top concentration of unaltered Pioglitazon in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution by M-IV represents the effectiveness in about threefold of the effectiveness of pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocousins and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazon with fibrous (a cytochrom P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive striking Pioglitazon, the marker was mainly found in the division (55%) and found to a lower level in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination life of unchangeable pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral cleance of the parent's substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxic studies, mice, rats, dogs and apes competed after repeated administration of plasma-volume enlargement, anaemia and reversible, excentralised heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to that, under the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the parent and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the fine growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) were inducted in male bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidinons led to an elevated frequency of colonists.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the markings "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated freight rate was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years in the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were compared to 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient shows a statistically significant decrease in the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postpondial increased triglyceride level, which is both on a effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as on the heavian Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckles, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, suggest the results that associated with the intake of pioglitazon not cardiovascular risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the markings "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In summary analysis of undesired events concerning bone mares from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon, increased incidence of bone mares in women.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study was submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, with the use of advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients where transplants was cancelled after a treatment duration of one year (by example, how often a new organ transplant or recovery of dialysis was needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter studies have been performed in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined, like Advagraf in comparison to Prograf / Prograft of the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immunosressive therapy and treatment of transplants, should make this medication or make changes in the immunosressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure by Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmune suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dose; settings of formulation or regime should only be performed under the engmating control of one in the transplant medicine (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosisadjustment has to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of deformation and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion of prograf on Advagraf the Tacrolimus level mirror should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks to change.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure measured as valley level, with both formulation and kidney transplantaneous patients are comparable.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus level mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in direct transplanted phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf Dosisschemas can last several days until the steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application for the suppression of transplantation must be calculated; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft transplantation The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose customizations can be later required, as the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilising the patient after the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplantation The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose recommended by Prograf on Advagraf have a graft receptor of twice daily dose of prograf capsules to a once daily taking of Advagraf, this changeover in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immunosuressiva on Advagraf once a day the treatment must begin with the transplantation of transplantation of transplantation of transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Carditransplant For adult patients who have been converted on Advagraf is an oral initiation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day at once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplantagoners Although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung cancer, pankre- and daring transplant patients in an oral initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplantlers in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose customizations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining bloodlines in the targeted area can be needed in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function, the kidney function has no influence on the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials by Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular provision of the serum-creatine-inspections, a calculation of the Kreatindia and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover of Ciclosporin on Advagraf At the transition from a ciclosporridge to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley level in the thoroughbred The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of absorbing and tolerability in individual cases under random sampling of thoroughbred Tacrolimus levels controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus level mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level mirror by Tacrolimus should also refer to conversion from Prograf on Advagraf, Dosage customization, changes of immunositive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tacrolimus perfection (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf have a drug with a low Clearance, customizations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State arrived.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible, if the level mirror in the blood is 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley level of Tacrolimus are usually found in full blood during the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent relief therapy of liver, kidney and cardioptics were usually used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplants or other side effects, which can occur in a consequence of Tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dose; settings of formulation or regime should only be performed under the engmating control of one in the transplant medicine (see section 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft detection that proved to be refractory over other immunosuressiva, there are still no clinical data for the retardent formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of graft reactions in adult heart transplants and transplants in childhood, no clinical data are still no clinical data for the retardent formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction in the Tacrolimus level in the blood and a weaken effect of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of vegetable oils (hypericum perforatum) is included, or other plant breeding agents during a treatment with advagraf. (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in blood is offered, because the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, as a cardiomyopathy, chamber or septumhypertrophy was observed, which therefore also may occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid exposure and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuressiva the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high degree of protection.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take the Tacrolimus, symptoms for pres such as headache, change of consciousness, seizures and blurred vision should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable healers, known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus and reduce blood levels of Tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood mirror with the benefit of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism to monitor and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintaining even more appropriate concentrations (see section 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction with Antimykotika such as Ketoconazole, fluorconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole, as well as with the Macroeyelid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV proteasiliers (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetikets showed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed Prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used for acute abortion actions, can increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabolic using CYP3A4 containing metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus increases the Clearance of steroid contraceptiva and thereby increase the hormone exposition, is particularly cautious in decisions concerning receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potentially decrease the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazon and extend their half-time period.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a minor number of examinations on transplants provide no indication that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunosuressiva, increased risk for unwanted events in relation to the process and result of the pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in conjunction with the Tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding to erythrocytes and Plasmaproteine may be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and the codynamic effects on molecular levels must be conveyed by the effects of Tacrolimus by its binding to a cytosoleic protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell.</seg>

<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In a interim report about a recent, multi-center study with oral Prograf was reported over 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosin as part of a 1: 1 Randomization study.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplantation, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less frequent in the first year after the transplantation (2,86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with Tacrolimus patients occurred in 21,7% of cases for the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly higher (p = 0.02) as the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosus (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases where there came to no acute transplantation occurred after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) and after 1 year (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the incidence of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterate was significantly lower in the patients with Tacrolimus patients.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-center study with oral Prograf was carried out to 205 patients who underwent a pancreas and kidney transplantation, which received a randomized process Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initiation (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently reached to achieve the targeted range level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplant The published clinical results of a monocentralised study with oral transplants showed at 155 patients (65 only gut, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multiviscous transplants) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone an updated survival rate of 75% to 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a lower hemateness value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of Tacrolimus, or caused by treatment with corticosteroid to run reinforcement of metabolism should be responsible for the higher Clearance rates.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolic in front of the excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly about the gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients treated by prograf (twice daily) on Advagraf (once daily) in relation to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was less than 10% lower than at Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application, if Advance is used to treat bleeding or preventing blood cells in surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII lack, which causes blood clots like bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but after a method used as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that was inserted into a gene (DNA) that is capable of supporting the creation of the human existence factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union. Recombinate, similar, however, is manufactured differently, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated by preventing blood cells and surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood vessels with "excellent" or "well rated" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyorexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to patients (allergic) against the human tinnacle factor VIII, mausoleum or hamsterprotein or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted a approval for the market of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy judge after the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1545">During treatment it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections an appropriate determination of factor VIII-Plasmaspaten.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and feature different semi-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40, of factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved, or if the blood pressure is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to detect an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic interventions must be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The evaluation speed is supposed to be paid according to the patient, where a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">This inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII in IgG Immunglobulins, which were quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Developing the risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk is dependent on the largest and other factors within the first 20 exposition.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposition and anamnetically known inhibitors, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, re-appear of (lowest titors) inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to be evaluated as a positive rating, but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of the ADVATE safety profile, which is necessary to submit an application of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the approval holder should apply to another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) officially announced that the company uses its application for approval for the transport of Li-Fraumeni-cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or soft arrows (tissues, the other structures in the body connects, surrounds and leans).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has genetically modified so that it may carry a gene into the body cells.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infections can trigger in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advent in advance could be injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to reform the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from which non-defective in the human body is made of p53 gene, usually contributes to restore damage DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undermining, in the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had tested the answers to the questions related to him, there were still some issues resolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the assessment of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP was created a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumors bring benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration, as well as the security of the pharmaceutical.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proven that advent in a reliable way can be produced and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient, harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company used the CHMP to be aware of whether the declaring consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered mode of effect" means that the tablets are so costed that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by allergy against pollen) in patients with nasal smudskin slipping (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment duration should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be impressing on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective dimensions were the changes in the swords of the hay fever symptoms that were reported from the patient before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours a diary and rated the symptoms of a standard scala how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported patients, the aerinaze reported, about a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% compared to patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal smucosa was considered, the patients showed a reduction in the symptoms by 37.4% to 26.7% in patients who received Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedycardia (cardiac disease), anaesthitis, headache, fatigue, insomnie (insomnia), somnolence (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be sensitive to patients who possibly insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenerge active ingredients or lauatadine (another drug for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer urinary or vascular diseases (hypertension), cardiovascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hyperfunction of thyroid) or already have a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a cerebral bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to the public transport of Aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, in the whole thing to swallow (i.e. without interrupting it, to break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data on infertility and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible, and should not be continued after closing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephehedrin can take off.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a reduction in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is based on alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrin such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisurid, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrin, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and not submit the data to address appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in occurrence of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or amplification of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In treating the treatment of patient groups, patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertonic disorders • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer or bronze enthusiasm in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, because antihistamines have otherwise able to prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, in which Erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients, irrespective of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine enzyme was not yet identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The infertility of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to pseudo-strictor properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients, however, should be aware that there may come in very rare cases to a drowsiness, which can lead to a impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS-Depression (sedation, Apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collage) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, Tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, shading Miktion, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tensions, euphoria, excitation, breathing failure, cardiac arrhythmia, thirst, margins, nausea, vomiting, preventive pains, dizziness, tinnitus, visual disturbances and hypertonic or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as Aropine-typical symptoms (mouth-drying, pupillary arre and - dilemation, hood, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of non-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / basophiles, as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the expression index P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose-trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of air capacity including reinforcement of subjectivity or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg there was no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachometer, or manifestations of a CNS detection.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients received aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined using the total cores for the symptom (except nasal smudskin swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in terms of degradation effect, determined using the nose slider skin, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose-trial for Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze at healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosing study, which was performed using the formulation of healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects were desloratadin bad.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure to a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, to toxicity in repetitive gift, to Genotoxicity and the reproducioxicity, the preventive data with Desloratadin may not recognize any special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its single components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-production studies, the combination of Loratadress / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to relieve allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets liners symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as riveting, running or itching nose and tearing eyes during simultaneous constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you can occur or diagnosed with the use of aerinaze following symptoms or diseases: • high blood pressure • palpitations, palpitations • cardiac arrhythmia • nausea and headache or a amplification of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Traffic noise and the operating of machines for application in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that aerinaze leads to drowsiness or raises the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze as you should download your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten the ingesture of Aerinaze If you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and turn the next dose at the time of time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin was very rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing, breathing, rash, rash and swelling) or rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Over cases of palpitations, palpitations, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach problems, diarrhea, hallucinations, muscle pain, seizure, muscle pain, seizure with increased physical activity, over cases of liver disease and over cases of remarkable liver values was also reported very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- Lyophilisat (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg- and 5 mg-melting tablets (tablets which dissolve in your mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children ages 1 to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of squares, booting the sleep and the performance in the day) and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body is used to take the syrup, the solution for inserting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms (symptoms number) by 25 to 32%, compared to decrease from 12 to 26% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria the decrease of the symptom after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius cannot be used in patients who may be overweight (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadine, or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted authorization to acquire SP Europe a approval for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should occur according to the previous disease and can be stopped after the sound of the symptoms and with their re-appear again.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended during the everyday use of continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinical relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets, in addition to which Erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study NSC 631570 intoxicated by Aerius and Alcohol were not intensified by alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients, however, should be clarified in very rare cases that can be drowsiness in very rare cases, which can lead to a impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with aerius were reported to patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events encountered more frequently than in placebo was tiredness (1,2%), mouth-drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse effect of headache was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadin and were treated with placebo for 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (ninety clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of non-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / basophiles, as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seless on endothelialcells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple outlets in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day was administered over 14 days a day, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study where Desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the neunfold of clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of air capacity including reinforcement of subjectivity or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the relieve of symptoms such as niesen, nose-secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacridity and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the overall cores of the questionnaire on quality of life in rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated by the underlying pathophysiology, because the underlying pathophysiology is uncounted in equology at different forms, and chronic patients could be prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histameless factor is an ursing factor in all urticarious illnesses, desloratadine is expected to improve in other forms of urticaria to improve symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the production of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to Antihistamine, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the youth up by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients with desloratadine treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients treated patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population was comparable in 4% of patients receiving a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no reference points for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine enzyme was not yet identified, so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty acid, low-calorie rich breakfast) does not apply to the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With desloratadine and Loratadine studies, with a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity of desloratadine and Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, genotoxicity and for the reproducioxicity, the preventive data with Desloratadin may not recognize any special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colour film (contains lactose-monohydrate, hymless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, jocarmin (E 132)), colorless film (contains hymless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken regardless of meals, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The exacerbated physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are proposed to support the treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, you should play a role in diagnosis, physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years, desloratadin restricted and experienced higher subtreble load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are restricted, is identical to the children who metabolic normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and Sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose-intolerance, glucose gactose-absorptionation or a sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency of this medication should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinical relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials involving Aerius tablets, in addition to which Erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study NSC 631570 was not intensified when taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">Overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the Aerius Sirup Group.</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine which could cause a strain of influenza, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks when a new strain of Grippevirus appears that humans can spread themselves easily because human beings have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects parts of the influenza virus in the vaccine as "physical foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes human body as body-foreign) is ununified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who have been diagnosed with diseases, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (extinction of bone tissue) or an immunreactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection that are caused by a relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerase has been used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">In general, Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokintical amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee set that the benefit of asutase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor is not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally admitted under "exceptional circumstances" since the approval of scientific reasons was only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited of approval for the market share of aggravase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">In combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1, protein inhibitors (PI) treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase capsules are supposed to be administered to pharmacokinethetic padding of Ambulavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see section 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambulavir should take into consideration the individual viral resistance and the patient's treatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambulavir as a solution for insertion is 14% lower than one capsule; therefore, ash capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram base (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Adurase capsules is 600 mg Amonavir twice daily with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (booklets), higher doses have to be applied to aitase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for axial capsules is 20 mg Amonavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amonavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy and Security of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protagonists were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data on infertility and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of aggravase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable dishes, the currant (hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk-reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambulavir during taking Ambulavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should not be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy do not lead to a healing of HIV infection and that it may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aemia does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV on others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules are supposed to be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneously antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the specialized information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy, and should be monitored in clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticason or other glucose syrup is not recommended, unless the potential benefit of treatment for the risk of systemic corsteroid effects including morbus Cushing and suppression of the triniotic function weighs (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the distortion of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended for the increased risk of myoma including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medication at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective for a reduced plasma level of Ambulavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ambulavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Ambulavir, patients should therefore be monitored at opiatric symptoms, especially if there are even more low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity, due to the high propylation content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution with certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Ackase should be set on duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitor, was reported about the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exererbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with medication that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hämophiles patients (Type A and B) who were treated with protease inhibitors, there are reports of an increase of bleeding including sponge cutaneous hematoms and hemmarthrosen.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections develop, which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorment is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immune suppression, higher body mass index), were reported cases by Osteonecrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width ascertain may not be given simultaneously with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with minor therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be used together with drugs, whose active ingredients are predominantly connected to CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes 82% reduction in AUC of Ambulavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma level with a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects of the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of vegetable dishes with currant (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already taken currant, the amonavirus can be checked and, if possible to check the virusload and add the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose customization for any of the medicine is not required if Nelfinavir is given together with Ambulavir (see also Eat irence below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambulavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg Ambulavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily applied to the efficacy and unthinkable of this treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="1968">In combination with Kaletra (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of Ambulavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ambulavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambulavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended that a close surveillance is recommended because the effectiveness and unthinkable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosin combination with Didanosin, however, due to the antastic component of Didanosin is recommended that the proceeds from Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for the gift of emiration in combination with Ambulavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with coniirence in combination with Amonavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, because the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be humiliated.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitor and existing limited data allow Nevirapin reduces the serum concentration of Ambulavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma bar.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be performed, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Ambulavir and Ritonavir is difficult for Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambulavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) from Rifabutin to 193% and thus to an increase in associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin together with aase are required to decrease the dose of ridonutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asthromycin combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma level of both medicines might be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosampleavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day resulted in increasing the Cmax of Ketoconazole on the 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fossilvavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions together with aase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions, which are associated with these drugs, if they are applied in combination with asutase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitor, it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can occur to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with Amonavir can lead to a lower the plasma level of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium-channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, nnidipin, nnidipin, Nimodipine, nanodipin and Verapamil can be increased by Ambulavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medication.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous taking with aase can increase its plasma concentration and with PDE5 inhibitors in related side effects including hypotations, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study included in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of fluorticasonate intranasal (4 times daily), while the endogenous Kortisol increased by approximately 86% (90% confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended to use this glucose costeroids, unless the potential benefit of treatment for the risk of systemic corsteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which depend heavily on CYP3A4, are distinctive increases of plasma bar with the simultaneous administration of Aboase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspire increases this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor to myopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medication is not recommended with Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with the benefit of Ambulavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be applied together with oral trajectively musdazolam (see Section 4.3) while the simultaneous application of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam around the 3 to 4-fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Ambulavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at opiatric symptoms, especially if there are even more low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historic comparisons, no recommendation can be given, such as the Ambulavir is administered at the same time with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anti-coagulinum, an increased control of INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of failure or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods to contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in the simultaneous gift of aemia (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be applied for the mother's possible risks for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk activating rats, Ambulavir-related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Amonavir is over for people in the breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of severe rats which was administered by the inflow in uterus to the end of the breastfeeding of Ambulavir, showed an increase in 12 body weight during the lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of postage, including fertility and reproductive ability, was not affected by the administration of Ambulavir to the parent.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The unthinkable of Agenerase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most related side effects related to the aitase treatment were slightly up to moderate, rose early and rarely resulted in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether they are used in connection with the ingestion or other medicines at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the disease disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects originate from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with proteasants did not pre-treated patients 1200 mg of Adurase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), assessed by the investigational agents than in connection with the study medication, were listed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as the treatment of laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of small and fast subretinal fat tissue, proliferative and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (bull).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Having been treated with 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons who had been treated with Ambulavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a medium duration of 36 weeks, only a case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study occurred in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Ambulavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin extracts were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and competed spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Ambulavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">In particular, osteonecrose was reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application for antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, a inflammatory reaction to asympatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In case of patients treated with PI had been treated twice daily with low dosired Ritonavir (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4), which were treated with patients who received Agenerase together with low dosired Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is able to observe an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures are required.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambulavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and avoids the processions of viral gag- and Gag-polarity with the consequence of a formation unirritated, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity of Ambulavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated by acute and chronic lymphoblast cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral hematocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of Ambulavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0,08 µm with acute infected cells and is 0,41 µm with chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambulavir vs. HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans are not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with the currently approved Fosampleavir / Ritonavir dosages - as seen in other Ritonavir-oostered treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the described mutations rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients who received 700mg of Fossilvavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred until week 48, with 14 isolates genotypic could be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the Isolate of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59, with proteasants did not appeared in treated patients who were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and the extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosampleavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) to patients with four-logical failure occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitor mutations on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical interpretative analyses, Genotypic interpretations systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambulavir / Ritonavir or Fossilvavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fossilvavir / Ritonavir defines resistance than the presence of mutations L10F / I, L33F, I54A / L / M / C / M, I54A / C / M / M / C / M, I54A / C / M, I54A / C / M, I54A / C / M, I54A / C / M, I54A / C / M, I54V and L90M in connection with a reduced probability of a virological response (resistence).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding relevance of certain mutations or mutations, changes are subject to additional data, and it is recommended to move the current interpretations systems for analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistence, clinical analysis systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypical data to estimate the activity of Ambulavir / Ritonavir or Fossilvavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistence tests have been developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs (release points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to interpretation of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amonavir associated samples creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross-resistance between Ambulavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fossilvavir resistor, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral patients, a resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambulavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors; the obtaining of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders that can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (100mg twice daily) and nucleosidy (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-two (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-insecurity of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group compared to the period adjusted (AAUCMB) in the plasma load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, at a non-subwoofer wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of untreated Agenerase is based on two controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was used in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">In the same time there was no low dosified Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) who abducted NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients had included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered at the treatment of treatment with PI pre-treated children who are considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered "unbleed" axis. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium duration (maximum) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambulavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Ambulavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambulavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on concentration of Amonavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as a failure penetration of Ambulavir from the blood circulation into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active ingredients in plasma, whereby the amount of unoccupied Ambulavir, which represents the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of uncertain Ambulavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active part in the metady concentration of the metady concentration in the Steady State of Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore medicines that induced CYP3A4, or inhibitions or substrate of CYP3A4, are required if they are given at the same time with aitase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of ackase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambulavir exposure, as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambulavir is a solution of 14% less bioverable than the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and axis capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammar base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the impact of renal kidney problems arise on the elimination of Amonavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemata lead to Ambulavir plasma bricks comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Amonavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity of Amonavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals benigne Adenome with dosages, which spoke to the 2.0 times (mice) or 3.8- times (rat) of exposure to people, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hevik-cellular Adenome and Karzinome was not yet clarified and the relevance of this observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">In the present position data on humans, both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application, however, little advice for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial resistance tests (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphooma test, microcore test of rats and chromosome test of human peripheric lymphocytes was amonavir, nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical trials with measurements of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously no significant toxicity in patients was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenerase yet after the end of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (by reducing its effect in relation to reducing the Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In the case of children under five years Aldurazyme the Gag-concentrations in the urine decreased by about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be sensitive to patients who possibly react strongly (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is every year all new information, possibly known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients receiving Aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to Genzyme Europe B.V. a approval for the market of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Oval, ovary of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicative for long-term enzymes in patients with safe diagnosis of a Mutilysacchariot I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial input rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased, if the patient is wearing this, all 15 minutes in individual steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as any interaction, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be monitored closely and infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment, in the revival facilities for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that virtually all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution in applying Aldurazyme (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, has to be careful due to the theoretical increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antithesis) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be accounted for and / or reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate where the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are taken drop, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen is considering.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the reaction occurred, can be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate that has occurred before the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracellular recording of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that were exported over the breast milk over the breast milk is recommended, it is not recommended during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse reactions in clinical trials were ordered mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, who were observed during the Phase 3 period or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs, in addition, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospa, breathing, and facial expressions (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children's unwanted drug-effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with mainly severe contracting form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, have been reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, whereby it usually came to a seroconversion during one month (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a pre-departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not detectable with radioimmunophoncipation (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients where it has never been to server version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacking low-body levels showed a robust reduction in the gag mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of Gag in Harn was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal up to low-neutral production efficiency on the enzymatic laronide activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of undesired drugs actions, even if the occurrence of adverse events typically fell together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enmist therapy is located in one of the hydrolysis of acute substrate and preventing a further accumulation to recovery of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells taken into the lyanosomes most likely about manosis-6-phosphat- receptor receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study included the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only one patient proved the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an ongoing expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated an improvement in lung function and the salinity upon which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme group and a group of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected procurement FEV is not significantly significantly and the absolute lung-volumes increased further to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a non-atomic treatment reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear apostasy of the Gag-mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was found that remained constant until the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manipulation between the patients suffering from using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes of the Shoulard AHI and visual acuity, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one-year-old open Phase 2 study conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetic of Aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients who were examined at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe deformation form and 4 with the mean age form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased GAG- mirror in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth rate (n = 7) was detected after the Z Score for these age group the younger patients with the severe deformation form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean failure rate, whereas in the older patients with severe deformation form only limited or even no progress in the cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations were carried out to the codynamic effects of different Aldurazyme dosing schematic on the Gag-mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a represented alternative in patients that represent difficulties with weekly infusions, but it is not demonstrated that the long-term clinical effectiveness of this two dosing schemata is equivalent to.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slowed down the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetremixed in its active form goes easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer lasting effects in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelioms, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had not yet received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer resulted in the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (other medicines against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (other medicines against cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin, survived an average of 12.1 months compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival period with Alimta 8,3 months, compared with 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>

<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin transactions must be given a day before and on the day of Pemetremixed gift, as well as the day after the treatment a corticosteroid.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose Pemetremixed must be taken at least 5 doses folic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first Pemetremixed dose as well as after each third load cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetremixed before each gift should be created a full blood image, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose of dose must take place under rectiresation of the Nadirs of blood or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the pre-curing therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery the patients must be treated according to notes in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are treated for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients non-hematological toxicity ≥ 3 degree (except neurotoxicity), the treatment must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient need the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dosing, a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- continue at the onset of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that patients suffering from 65 years of age or over 65 years of age, an elevated side risk-risk of patients in the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to inadequate data on infertility and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials with a Kreatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, there were no dose customizations required for all patients recommended Dosage customizations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance from under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times the upper borilirubin- limits and / or transaminasenvalues of &gt; the upper limit value (with absorption of liver tissue) or &gt; 5,0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver tissue) not specifically studied in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the Knock- marking suppression and Pemetremixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophies once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombo- zytends has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophies, thrombozytense and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as it observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hematological and non-hematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was discounted when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be relieved with pemetremixed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic measure to reduce toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous non-steroid antiphatic logistical (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylacid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, to avoid breast cancer (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, intended for treatment with Pemetremixed, must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-term evaluation time for at least 5 days before the therapy, and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events occurred, corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including Dehydratation, existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid-collection in transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion of the pathoxed treatment should be owed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovasculular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed occasionally when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of shadow fuels (excluding yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible cranial of reproductive ability is due to pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment - Ginn insisted, advice on sperm motions.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses non-steroid antiphatic logistical (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a diminished pemet al excretion result in a reduced increase of effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore be careful when patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in a high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, should be avoided since the day of therapy and mindes- tens of 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the reactionary potential as Piro- xicam or rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be mixed with pemetremixed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral antibodies and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Standards Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient's ducks with oral anticoagulation.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of Pemetremixed at pregnant women, but as with ande- antimetabolites are expected in an application during pregnancy severe birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, demanding and after careful breakdown of use for the mother and risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible shafts of reproductive ability is due to pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment beginning, advising on the sperm convention.</seg>

<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side-side effects, which were detected after the launch of orlistat, is not known, because these events were voluntary reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">+ It is plausible that the treatment with alli to converse in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal effects may result.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects, excluding significant clinical findings.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years is not recommended, since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of an chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or excessive triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapist, 59% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223), compared with 57% of the patients treated with Ondansron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapist, 81% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189), compared with 69% of the patients treated with Ondansron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the market of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicative: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emoidal chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and vomiting of nausea and vomiting in moderately emoidal chemotherapy due to a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding a corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colorectal cancer, patients should be monitored using anamorous obituation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is provided with the benefit of Palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or tend to avoid such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapists gift, Aloxi is neither to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In prehistoric studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five evaluated chemotherapists (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-static concentration of the CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based on pharmacokinean analysis (Dont Ethason and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Deitethnine, Cimetidine, Cimetidine, Paroxetine, Coritiine, Ritonavir, Sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not available, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it is necessary to be considered by the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials the most common effects were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), who at least probably stood with Aloxi in the context of headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of excess ineactions and reactions at the administration site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events such as in the other dosing groups; no dose-response relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume is a dialysis, but probably no effective therapy with a Aloxi- Overdodisation.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received an moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cxorubicin and 250 micrograms / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin (half-time 7.3 hours) received, that was given to day 1 without Dexamethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron received patients compared to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emulated chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ventricular de- and repolarization involved in the ventricular channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the ECG effects of I.V. effects of kerosonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift, a slow elimination of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale period of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 per g / kg in relation and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean medium (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Derived from pharmacokinetic simulations, the total exposition of 0.25 mg Palonosetron achieved a total value of 0.75 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days; however, the Cmax after one-one intravenous intravenous period was 0,75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% of the kidneys will be eliminated, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have in comparison to Palonosetron more than 1% of the antagonistic effects on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 can be involved in smaller measurements, the CYP1A2 can be involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron made some 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous placebo injection, the total body number 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In case of patients with severe liver function, the terminale elimination rate and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient on the maximum human exposure exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of these clinical trials showed evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels, which can be involved in ventricular De- and Repolarization, and extend the expansion period.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose of the therapeutic exposure during humans), which were given daily over two years, led to a increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasmas (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, trinierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, however not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi used for a unique application, the relevance of these results are very small.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee on Humanist Immunity (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion, in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C the drug was recommended to use Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is to be similar to a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same arzazensely ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference pharma").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-persistent) hepatitis C (caused by a virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic survey the liver tissue has damages, also the values of the liver disease Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) increases in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was produced, which stimulates this to the formation of the effect.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon laid data before the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study enrolled in patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus found in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed, that data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the market-market drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke on the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was reamed up with more patients than in the reference cancer; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the trial used in the study on how far the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to treatment of impetigo (a skin infection) and small infected infirmations (Riss- or cutting), depreciation and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been demonstrably or probably caused by methicillinresistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarm go against this kind of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was taken after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hautwunden, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar contacts: when the results of both studies were taken up with Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients received both groups on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was caused by the treatment of abscuba (vain cavities in body tissues) or of infection that have been proven demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the client site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of alargo over the short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections are over against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmary, depreciation or paralyzed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which there are no improvement within two to three days, should be considered even once and an alternative therapy is considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a Sensibilisation or heavy local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment was canceled, the ointment should be carefully caught and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections, which MRSA is known as Erreger or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials at secondary wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients suffering from infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected site occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retinamulin and other topical resources on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which were achieved in human application to steady skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 In the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retinamulin Salbe based on a smooth skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after topical use in patients, dosages are not required if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction elasticity after oral ingestion and inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fine / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated, and the use of retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding is continued, terminated or the therapy with Altargo continued, is between the benefit of a breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the alargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, alargo, the most frequently reported side effect of irritation at the administration centre, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pandromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilot (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action from Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial cells of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosomes, which differs from the binding of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">The data indicates that the Binyomales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomalen P-Binding area and the Peptidyltransferred centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this connection of inhibiting Pandromutiline the peptidyltransfer, partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">In case of the local prevalency of resistance, the application of retapamulin should appear in at least some infectious forms, a consultation by experts should be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin against S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus the presence of strains with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was applied 1% Retapamulin Salbe a day under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample took place in days 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording in people after topical use of 1% sallow on 200 cm2 = 238 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism In vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro-check on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse lymph-test or in cultures of human peripheric blood cytes as well as in rats-microkernel test for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither at male nor female rats signs of reduced fertilizing with oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thereby achieving an estimated exposure of up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of people (topical application to 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats were observed at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above), development stoxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the approval for the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as described in module 1.8.1, is present and works before the product is marketed as long as the product market is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the approval for the market is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates on the RMP to be agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for BEST," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Security Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place, you should end the application of alargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Don't turn other ointments, creams, or lotions on the surface that is treated with Altargo, if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, in the mouth, or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment consists of one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After rebear the salad, you can cover the affected area with a sterilen bandage or a gazing tape, unless your doctor has given you to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is available in an aluminum tube with a plastic bag, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag, which contains 0,5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambient is used to protect Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not yet immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient temperature is used as part of a two doses existing vaccine, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambient sounds can only be used while immunisation is a lower risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the two doses can be reduced to an end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresent dose is required against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines affect the immune system (the natural resistance of the body), "which can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix Adds since 1996 and has been approved by Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same illnesses, however, Twinrix Adults and Twinrix Children are administered under three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults are also used as proof of the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antithesis one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient temperature was between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the ambient temperature of Ambirix was similar to a 6-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache pain, loss of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, matisation (tiredness) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient may not be sensitive to patients who possibly react sensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a approval for the placing of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic matization with ambient ambirix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refression is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combined fuel.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C surface antigen observed in accordance with the combination of anti-hepatitis C surface antigen (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet completely secured, whether immunocompetent persons, which are addressed to a hepatitis A vaccine, as they are not protected from immunological memory as well as in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As in all injection practices, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring always should be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against Hepatitis B is necessary, the standardization of hepatitis B is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis and persons with disturbances of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAVE and anti-HBS antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccination result, this injector should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombocytopenie or blood clots, Ambirix can injected an exception of subcutaneous injection as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambirix in the second year of a separate injection process, Tetanus-, acellular pertussing, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus, was given the immune response to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunoglobressive therapy or patients with immunoglobes must be assumed that perhaps no adequate immunity is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, was the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in previous Thiomersale- and preservative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered at a total of 1027 vaccine at the age of 1 and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the tolerability of ambient sounds compared to the 3-cans combined fuel.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matism at a calculation basis per vaccination dose ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the test after the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects were given to the ambient sounds, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matism was comparable high (i.e. about the total vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects were compared to 36.2% compared with the subjects who received the 3-cans combined fuel).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pregnated pain and matism was low and comparable to, which was observed after administration of combination with the 3-cans vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old imports was comparable to the occurrence of local actions and general conditions in the ambirixgroup with 360 ELISA units, formal inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, in the 6- until 11- year old, however, after vaccination with ambient sounds a frequent occurrence of pain (at injection site) per dose, not per proband, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of imports that reported over heavy side effects during the 2-doses vaccination schemas with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen reported was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out at Impairingen at the age of 1 and including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% had a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 aborted dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study performed at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined fuel with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was extendable, the seroprotective rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose impfmaterial.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response shown in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds a month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, Impairings received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with ambirix or a 3-dose vaccines with a combination of 360 ELISA units and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immunisation with ambient temperature in 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunogens observed in this study was comparable to that, which after vaccination of 3 cans with a combined fuel, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was observed in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">A clinical study in 12- to including 15 year old could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies are comparable to immunisation in 0-6 months vaccinated in the 0-12 months vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose ambirix in the second year of life is combined with a combined seal, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of combined measles mumps vaccines, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical trial which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, showed the current formulation similar to seroprotective and seroconement rates such as the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both pre-inspected and / or physical visible changes after the reset.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (yellowing) and other symptoms that possibly need a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot protect completely from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is infected with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child may not feel unsafe or ill / feel) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause the liver, or cause symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">If you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may have occurred through itching skin extracts, shortness or swelling of facial or tongue. • If you have occured any allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e., within 6 months and before the equivalent of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will give you / your child from a vaccination with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of an effective hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a combinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective stock will usually be given one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, ambirix is injected with heavy blood clots, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. if you / your child is weakened because of a disease or a treatment in your body's own defense, or when you / your child moves forward / down.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can't be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how much reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Do you take your doctor if you / your child may take more medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without enrollment) or if you have received / your child recently / has been given or immunoglobulins (antibodies) or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at ambient ambient, it should be vaccinated on separate places and different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually ambient women is not administered, except it is urgently needed, that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient temperature is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packages to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been announced since the issuance of the first approval for the market, CHMP grants the view that the benefit-risk ratio for ambient temperature remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only launched in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medication is limited due to the low patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonites can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hypertonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniac concentrations) in the history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided - split up on several individual doses to meals - slucked, mixed with food or via a Gastrostomieschi (through the stomach-leading hose) or Nasensonde (through the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since ammonite was not compared with any other treatment or placebo (a pseudostem, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also result in loss of loss, a degradation of acid in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, flawess, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, irregular body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonium is effective in patients with disturbances of the urinary life cycle to high ammoniakages.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonola was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the self-tenderment of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme had already manifested in the newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifested form (incomplete enzyme defect, which is manifested after the first life month) there is an indication of the use if in the anamorous, hypertonic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallow problems, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early lack of carbamylphosphatsynthesizasis or ornithintranzamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallow problems, as an risk for the creation of Ösophagusulcera, if the tablets enter not immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with contrasting heart failure or severe cardiac insufficiency as well as with sodium reprimand eco-formation, only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat about the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous formulation of phenylacate an young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came into a slowdown of neuronal displacement and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether Phenylacetate is eliminated in the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the breastfeeding time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients underwent an adverse event (AE), and at 78% of these adverse events, it was assumed that they were not with AMMONAPS in connection.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdozation occurred in a 5-month-old small child with a good dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phenylacate, which showed dosing doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimited neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacate is a metabolic active link conjugated by acetylating glutamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is separated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram it is drowned in sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of meaning that the diagnosis is early release and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborns was almost always infist, and the disease led themselves to treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogue to death within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen exposition (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacate), protein reduced cheat and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate in post-party (however within the first life month) diagnosed disease to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it occurred with the time with many of mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifested form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous scarbamylase deficiency), which were treated with a hypertonic encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet was the survival rate of 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some cases a further deterioration of neurological condition occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacate which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in nutritious healthy adults and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">Phenylbutyrat and its metabolites were also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablets form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclical disorders or hemogglobetia, after varying doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning, no phenylacetate was detectable in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three individual doses), the medium phenylacetate concentrations have been rated five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is divided within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had been treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 up to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either by oral (infants and children who can not swallow any tablets or patients with gorging problems) or via a Gastrostomieschi or Nasensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">After previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serenproteins in plasma should be kept within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early lack of carbamylphosphatsynthesizasis or ornithintranzamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If Rattenist were exposed before the birth of Phenylacate (active Metabolit by Phenylbutyrat), there came to lesions in the pyramines of the brain rind.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactose, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretions of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on examinations on the exposition of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruptions of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram liquid sodium phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some cases a further deterioration of neurological condition occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations have been detected by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The small measuring scoop 0,95 g, the medium measuring scoop 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must have received the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare cases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they can't separate the studs of waste products, which can not separate after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When you examined laboratory studies, you need to inform the doctor that you may have AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During a breastfeeding you can't take AMMONAPS because the medicine could go over in breast milk and hurt your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, flavours, descending of obedience, disorientiveness, memory deficits and a worsening existing neurological states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you want to determine one of these symptoms, get immediately with your doctor or with the emergency of your hospital to an appropriate treatment in connection.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten the ingesture of AMMONAPS, take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2877">You should also take AMMONAPS on the same individual outlets or via a stomach fistle (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a Nasensonde (hose that is run through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • remove from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Take a straight edge, e.g. a measuring scoop over the edge of the knife to remove excess granulate. • Example the recommended number of measuring scoop granulate from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronarsyndromen (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable Angina (a form of pain in the breast basket with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "St- Hebdo" (an abnormal measuring value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox in any of some gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) compared to conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a shutter, and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without gift of GPI - with preventing new events (deaths, heart failure or Revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was equally effective in terms of all indicators as well as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in patients, possibly sensitive to patients (allergic) against bivalentudine, other miludine or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure, as well as with people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an eligible replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. approval for the market share of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndroms (instabile Angina / Non- ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency relief, or when an early intervention is scheduled.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by a infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in further sequence a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased, and infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by a infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one of the intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single Bolus gift from Angiox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes), a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed and administered intravenously intravenously before application.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is worth more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal renal function of kidney (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which should be subjected to a PCI (whether using bivalentudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient for testing and the ACT lasts 5 minutes after the second bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to the approval phase III- PCI-study (Replace-2), which led to approval was the ACT value 5 minutes from the gift of the bivalentudin-Bolus with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and with dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unfractionated Heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous gift of low molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood-risk problems due to a disorder of hemostatic system and / or irreversible bacterial disorder. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalentudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although in PCI-patients with Bivalentudine, most of the blood cells occur at arterial puncture can occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronarintervention (PCI) during the treatment in principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who will take Warfarin and treated with Bivalentudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Standards Ratio) should be used to ensure that the value after placing the treatment with Bivalirudin again reached the existing level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of antibodies (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozygaggregates) can be assumed that these active ingredients are increasing the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalentudin with thrombocytes aggregates or anti-coagulators, clinical and biological haemakers are regularly to control in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development involving debinding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalentudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalentudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalentudine group as well as in the comparative groups of comparative groups, women as well as in patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to the ACUITY and Timi measure for heavy bleeding, as defined in table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding came to less frequently than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY is defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, hematology with a diameter of ≥ 5 g / dl without an obvious blood flow, reduction of hemoggloomy level of ≥ 3 g / dc with well-known blood flow, reoperation due to a blood flow, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorations associated with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" Punching, retroperitoneal, gastropod, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study with Bivalentudine at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalentudin Group as well as in the comparative groups of comparative groups, women as well as in patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding came in significantly less than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organically in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, treatment with Bivalentudin immediately collapse and the patient can monitor engmaschig in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalentudine, a direct and specific Thrombinder, which binds to the catalytic centre as well as at the Anionenbinism region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or in straight line.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalentudine in Thrombin, and thereby its effect, is reversible because Thrombin turn slowly resplits the binding of bivalentudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby reducing the function of active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by bivalentudin with serum from patients with which there has come to heparininductive thrombocytopenie / heparininductive thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, bivalentudine shows an dosis- and concentration-dependent anti-coagulatory effect caused by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patient following an PCI, an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg Bivalirudine was given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is to be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study was administered unfractated Heparin or Enoxaparin (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / Not-ST-Hebdo (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalentudin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronarintervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalentudin as Peptide is a catabolic syndrome in its amino acid components with subsequent reexploitation of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metaboo, who resulted in the split of the Arg3-Pro4 binoculation of the N-terminale sequence by Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the upper thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease that does not have enough insulin to control the glucose (sugar) in blood or cannot process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin injectable differs very marginally of human insulin, and the change means that it operates faster and a shorter response time has a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two trials with a total of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the insulin does not work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycemylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes after six months, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% at insulin pro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration amounted to 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be sensitive to patients (allergic) against insulin or one of the other ingredients, or in patients that suffer from a hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to grant approval from Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is available as a subcutaneous injection either in the sphere of abdominal wall or delta angle, or subcutaneous infusion due to continuous infusion in the area of abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and the diminished insulin delivery, insulin needs can be reduced with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Each change of real strength, the mark (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelay etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A adequate dosage or the demolition of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-induced diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazia; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient on an other insulin type or an insulin should be made under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The response time of a hypoglycemia depends on the effects of insulin-used insulin and can therefore change the treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, angiotine-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitor, fluoxetine, monooxetine, salizylphal, salizylactic, and sulphonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympathizers, such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenders are weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies in the reproductive-oxicity showed no differences between Insu- lingonulisin and humankind regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin enters into the human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in the breast milk, it is still resorated after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the incidence of clinical trials are listed, grouped after system organic classes and sorted by the frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000;</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is failed to switch the injection place within the injection area continuously, can occur in a lipodystrophy on the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemics with loss of consciousness can be treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 up to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriate person, or treated by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a Glukagonism, the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the urine cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the real time is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes (insulin-) insulin-based dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, an increase in proportioned glucose effects, and at 0.3 E / kg or more, a proportional increase in the glucose levels, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin injector has twice as fast active effects as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose effects of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data, it was confident that an application of insulin-ulisisin 2 minutes before the meal is reached a comparable posterior glycaemic control, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin has been geared in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denial control was given as a human standard insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is deposited in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycaemic control such as human normal insulin is given to the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
