the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its low size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; consol@@ or ; by making this easier available .
further information about the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; register .
to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions .... Open the card tools and select the required modules .
this is a list of standard modules from the package K@@ DE ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that includes &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras stor@@ my . then you can view the side , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of stor@@ my , if present , extingu@@ ish .
you can reach the module An@@ gle Filter ( also called folder filters ) in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under the ex@@ tras . by module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s current working directory on different kind of filters .
to view the DO@@ M construction work in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as a default , the indication begins with the root notes of the document , example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root no@@ des .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text @-@ views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of a so @-@ called folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each item is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property of the larger objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or a folder represents the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries in it . according to this way , big files can be detected , even if they are far below in the folder hier@@ archy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be viewed as an graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View , is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of sensu@@ al colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on the view of color mode , can be either a depth for the light detection of the pollution or the image of another file association as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for any feature , you can specify if there is enough space to display , or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates can occur or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates can occur or if the surface is set out by limitations when signs of Tre@@ em@@ ap . furthermore , you can define the relative position of sign@@ atures in the rectangle .
in manufacturing algorith@@ ms for tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to display the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always available to show the exp@@ ir@@ ation of entries , and this framework need place , which is lost , then the lower entries is lost if the rectangle is square .
as the division of the area is done to the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left . in this case , it is necessary for the lab@@ eling and avo@@ idance of space losses by setting always adv@@ anta@@ geous to create spaces that are as possible as square . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second .
you can define the minimal area for one entry on the menu entry . instead , a sample pattern in the area of the ordered entry is drawn , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View , as a little test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ on@@ or ; menu below the ex@@ tras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

although &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management - workflow .
improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; an open source project . that means it is on the support of the end source . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ f came ; try the mel@@ on of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . if you use this link , your web browser doesn &apos;t open a page in error report . all required information are already listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l came ; is a project supported by a community . so , if you &apos;re a regular user of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , we would like to answer you any questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be English speaking , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ um ; visit the homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; to participate , registration is in the developers mailing list . guide to report in the developers mailing list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; .
if you come &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; for the first time , you will be asked where you specify your pictures and your database . specify a local , remote or remote file . simply enter p@@ ad@@ ames or click the folder symbol file symbol to select a folder .
in the second field you must specify a local folder on your computer . this path will be saved for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders such as you want to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; you will also use as a Al@@ ben@@ Library . att@@ itudes di@@ gi@@ K@@ am in addition to collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top file , the pictures , as base folder . &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; seen each sub @-@ folder as an album . no picture is changed with this folder . during the throughput of the folder you &apos;ll get a progress indicator as these :
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l came ; dur@@ a recur@@ sive li@@ ve@@ al li@@ ad in its whole depth . you can &apos;t exclu@@ de any sub@@ folder , unless it is in clo@@ aked file . this allows you to include extra@@ ordin@@ ation &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; do you complete a point in front of the name of the folder .
if you take a existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in my baby list do not have photos as symbols . you can change it from the album and put it on the folder symbol . this will then be used as an album symbol . further details will be found in the section albums .
once you configured the base folder , you can set in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; use your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to manage my albums and my sample list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can handle and di@@ gi@@ ate . if you need to figure out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help Roh@@ kam@@ i support .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera device is provided to you with your digital camera and you can download images directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reader is supported , supported by your operating system , and work together .
modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is used as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ z used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also a free , advanced software collection for digital cameras which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large and transm@@ is@@ sions about the serial port is slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras are available below this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the EX@@ IF support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be able to see any pre @-@ image or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; di@@ gi@@ val came , how easy to expand his functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint mod@@ ulation structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . target is to provide the modules all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a little module to supplement a function than the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; even to perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and lay out of pictures everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , on the horizontal cutting line or another application window . the only limitation is that you can &apos;t lay any picture in keywords , dat@@ alog@@ y list or search .
- A file selection allows you to recover the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields which are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar code . thus , the fil@@ tering is shown on the file name only if this ind the tool@@ view is also displayed . which fields are displayed in the dialog box .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single Alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be stored in a single Alb@@ um@@ tree , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ren@@ ames or after the date where the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select an image directly to an album . select an image directly to an album . select an album of Imp@@ orting Screen photo .
to move a picture from an album to another one or move , you can select the photo with mouse on the target album and exp@@ ire . in the then release menu , you &apos;ll need to post@@ p@@ one if the image is moving or copy . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to provide information about this collection . to access the album features , you &apos;ll need to edit and edit the album tab on the album and select File Menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums so you can select under a common name . if you are using a collection from the tool bar or view the albums after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , latest : this place the date on the el@@ dest , the latest image or the passage of the album . it is first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first opened an album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this is not the first photo in the album not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; as an album show insert quot ; select . in addition , you can pull the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be contained in a collection and collections may not be om@@ itted .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; supports the input of topics for individual photos in the field of my sample list below the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window shows you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fiers in the tool@@ bar .
if you open a album the first time , you must wait briefly , while the th@@ umb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid them in which you can generate all the th@@ umb@@ nails in the menu ex@@ tras .
information on each image are displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is this , you can change via settings . select the albums side and adjust the area prefer@@ ential images to your wishes .
the th@@ umb@@ nails have a help window , the release . if you have a moment to rest for a moment on a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photos . the image shows up in the main window , displays such a window .
photos are all that happened at &amp; di@@ gi@@ al ; go . albums and tags allows you to organize your pictures so as it fits you . you can reach all functions that are with &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you can reach the menu menu of the preview or the menu in menu bar . you have the choice between viewing the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F4 image editing ... or select the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and edit ... Select a guide , as you can edit your photos . you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button . here , and how you will be able to custom@@ ize your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; K@@ DE ; manual .
you should note that after processing through other image processing programs may come to problems with the image containing met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs store this data to save the modified image . thus , this information can be saved from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as Orientation , Bl@@ end , etc .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l came ; provides two ways to turn out . the easiest way to select and choose the right mouse button on the preview . in the lower menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can select the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you will keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc . ) .
if you remove a photo from &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; extingu@@ ish , it is moved in the tr@@ ash of &amp; K@@ DE ; moved . F@@ 8 Photo Clear or if you prefer to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; de@@ f .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organize your photos from the data . &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; used either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the dat@@ alog@@ y , so that you can only be shown the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords offers a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos . tags are stick@@ ers , individual photos or all groups . as soon as a keyword is assigned , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that were marked with this keyword will be displayed .
Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и can be arranged in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also login parts of the tree &amp; quot ; my keyword t@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; summar@@ ize , so you can find the tags that you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , stored . you can also use your tags in other programs . also , you can re @-@ imported your keywords in the loss of the database once &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; my keyword table ; or select a new keyword when you click on a existing keyword , this keyword will be added to this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a keyword , the photo is not extingu@@ ished . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu , which gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the characteristics of a sample by clicking it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
to select another photo as an album symbol , you &apos;ll need to select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to get &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; s functionality you have to deal with keywords : as soon as you have chosen the photos , you &apos;ll need to drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; you can also click here with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords : when you select one of the keyword to him , you can choose one keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was done , one for the event , where it was done , etc .
once you have a photo with keyword , this will appear under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you open to the photos and select the menu menu of the photos and select from the tags menu . the menu only shows you the tags that were assigned to the photo .
the time @-@ beam view shows a tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ ous hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time frame you need to select only on the lower rectangle of the box frame , which gives the time unit . by this , all matching images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . then this appears in the list below .
cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
fog Se@@ as@@ er search@@ box is a small lamp that is green if the search is found . if you click here the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all the pictures displayed again . if the search has found nothing , the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this search for a simple search box , as described above . you can search this search here but as a live search , which is always fil@@ tering what you have entered as a search crit@@ eri@@ on . after you have stored it a filter in the list .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and search will be performed . if you want to change your selection after the search , you &apos;ll need to select one name in my search list , select the corresponding entry from the view of my search list and select an option in his context menu .
if you are looking for searching , the form appears in search of search for the previous search . if you are looking for extended search , the dialog appears to change your previous search . here are more rules for finding your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Advanced Search .
if you want to delete a existing search , select the context menu in the context menu .
the Advanced search offers you an extended search form with many search param@@ et@@ ters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; s database can be sought .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search qu@@ ery in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . any option can be deleted by operators or delete / or delete any option . each option can link with others about the logical surg@@ eries all ... , A ... , No ... or min . furthermore , you can create search of the type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ; create .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . these enables images to compare these sign@@ atures . the lower the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they comply with them . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop to any picture . by means of a swelling can push the result selection or resi@@ zed . if you push a picture of somewhere on the icon of un@@ precise search in the left side bar , this will open and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : free sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and di@@ gi@@ ate ; finds the appropriate pictures . also here a swelling could be set .
this rider is an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull out a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this is of course taking your pictures ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filters . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . he works like a live geo@@ ord@@ ner .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ f came ; introduces a lumin@@ ous window at your disposal with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view of the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To the illumin@@ ant from the context menu . if you are back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ ous quickly with the L Extras table .
from the presentation bar you can compare the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you perform a preview of the tool@@ bar , you can select a look at one of the pictures , then you will compare these pictures from the other picture . you can compare the same area of both images .
another mode is better suited to navigate quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate pairs from the tool bar , then the two first images will automatically be uploaded into the areas of the same image . now , the right mouse button will be displayed in the right section . this will simpli@@ fy it through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal sol@@ ving actions work directly from the LEDs as well as the F4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both th@@ umb@@ nails in the illumin@@ ants . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each range , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function which you need to cross the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture , you need to click and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . use the zoom controllers under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel around in the picture and beyond zo@@ oming . this happens in both images when you are in the mode ahead .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital branch management considers any part of the process after the image has been made up to fin@@ alist output and permanent storage . each of the photos saves , sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make it in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how you can back up your pictures , protect , protect and use photos again . we look at the procedure for digital photographers of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; we consider downloading , backup , evaluate , stiff@@ ness , archi@@ ved , optimize , wait , and export images files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management adop@@ ts , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ tion@@ ed , sec@@ tion@@ ed , conf@@ ection@@ ed , conf@@ ection@@ ed and exported content which are a mon@@ et@@ ely or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data , information on or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I couldn &apos;t claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find any specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many shots you don &apos;t want to save both in a database and store very fast search and a safe archi@@ ving that you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you have to do and know before you need to be organized in your system . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be saved or on a network drive &amp; etc ; notice that you need to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly about your memory location . if you are able to take pictures on your disk . if you make enough photos , then you &apos;ll use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then you can print a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % Archives and 5 % work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the option met@@ ad@@ ata store in the installation page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ al ; this ensures that ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forgot this , you can subsequently save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? for this , &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; to them a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes available . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should select any photo keywords , labelling and evaluation . of course , you can then select all images that will need the same attribute and set the value then . it makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let &apos;s now take you with keywords , keywords , as you are frequently called by other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalog@@ u@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded keyword , then it is &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; automatically add the pictures to the right place . the revers@@ al of the hier@@ archy is not problem and can easily be done by using a sub @-@ tree on another . the modified keywords are being pursued by &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; updated during the sub@@ trees .
the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is exagger@@ ated . this is a very rough representation because each block of met@@ ad@@ ata exists in truth out of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data will show properties of all pictures .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to inscri@@ ptions or comments , the third important tool to catalog@@ u@@ ate your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to simply see most of your pictures simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y . Wow ! one starts to dre@@ aming , associations , the historical time span is present again , you might even hear the silence . the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others consider your photos look more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell you a story . remember , the key is the meaning of viewer to help Him to help Him understand what you understand .
it is fine , if a picture is not perfect , if it is the strength only with a let@@ tering for himself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you can also store a lot of text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export it for a selection of images . so you &apos;ll have to tell it for your wishes into the lab@@ eling and / or title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation is already with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already in@@ counter @-@ reaching and will be able to review your journeys with geographical data . you can also export your journeys with geographical data . you can also export the pictures on the entrance . you can also export the pictures by G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gle@@ e viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also available in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setting side of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l came ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should be your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not requested , the name of a company or organization can be used . after which the value was saved , it should not be changed . this field does not support nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : linked with the author . this field contains the description of the photographer . examples of this field can be titles , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ r@@ k to the author field , this must be also completed .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify who is the photo . if the photographer has been listed here as a Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then you can see the picture here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , here the group / agency offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than base knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator can use this , in the image embedded met@@ ad@@ ata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ f came to provide such a module for stap@@ le processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the street or a fire . this type of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , it is a problem with the so @-@ called new media .
Kro@@ ll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that have a loss of data .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous must be treated and you can &apos;t buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discretion .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you are good dis@@ ks and good attach@@ ments and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . therefore it turns the right to choose .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible for mistakes , even if you have just been writing . therefore , they use a control mechanism for use . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection it comes to chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster &apos;s apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux . it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to the damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drive , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which has been said to CDs and DVDs , of course , is also used for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good admission application on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also , you should leave the media with a description , date &amp; author license and then on a clean , dark dry and protected animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ppy disks keep your statistics for itself . their manufacturer details include a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field study about trou@@ bles@@ hooting of hard drives : flo@@ pp@@ ings
shortly : dis@@ cos keep the longest in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temperature scores the most common error cause , SM@@ ART can not determine this error . some of the SM@@ ART provided this error . this is especially les@@ bian and publishing houses . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a power output before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally made without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make up much , it looks differently with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processor . these can cause heavy damage , complete data loss , hard@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves before the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of energy resources absorbed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ bar contains even an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lighten@@ ing and thereby protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should also know that all peripher@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable fashion , which can also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable @-@ mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage guard your system protects your system before smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you . even a fall of a few seconds can lead to the loss of int@@ oler@@ able data . therefore , it may be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically set up to store the system if a power cut off . if you buy a US@@ V , you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare its security in electricity problems with the cost to avoid . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end you should always remember all the cables before you ride to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the correct configuration you can use this as drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destinations for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any data .
they are compared to the hard drives at home , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services which are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional version provides you more at your disposal , in the event of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . data transmission errors are automatically adjusted due to the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a partial storage . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably .
the diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are due for transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integr@@ ating between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you should have been destroyed in your computer . it is quite wor@@ r@@ ying that there is no protection to your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than the one in your computer .
reliable network parts are a further source for transfers , since they create interference within the data streams . in normal file systems these mistakes remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle drivers at lower level and is highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the tender and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
these two factors are not under@@ estimated ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . in Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most . it leads to a lower damage , as such as theft or new@@ install@@ ments . and it is currently being restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; yet no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ RC and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . a very good English article you will find here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the exam@@ ining process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic of all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xels . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , a sensor size of 6 Megapixel and a high @-@ quality look are the optimum solution for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you &apos;ll get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you make no problem affected by a data loss . so you can secure your data from a plan and test this backup before you can make anything dangerous like the re@@ installing your operating system , making an exchange of disks or the size of hard drives .
suppose you take your safety on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a lightning bolt hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget an aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect a whole room or the entire house .
hence , des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ing means no local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs up into the neighbouring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , is more common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a securing that is not immediately available , you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete restoration . this creates a complete moment of time to two time points : the complete set @-@ back and the last difference .
in@@ cre@@ ment@@ ing f@@ use : a backup of the files changed since the last backup . generates several moments ago . you can restore the original status at any time . this f@@ use comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it had been sam@@ pled and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily setup your machine . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions , or other types of file transfer script . copied to the difference of files that have been changed . this happens if compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come to a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment of the working files . at the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment@@ ary for each month . every other di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have done a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the internet .
so valuable pictures can survive the next 40 year , that is approximately the period of time you really interested in you because they are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ fore@@ see@@ able because of your nature needs to be careful with caution and re @-@ evaluate it during the time . unfortunately , there is no other option to be compatible with caution . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system , you can then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with the area and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put it on a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it on .
&amp; coding ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 , and Reis@@ er@@ FS / dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of motor@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day isn &apos;t able to read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard developed by GIF . but it is loss of loss , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata . the down@@ side is that it has a relative number of administration information , but not as many as T@@ IFF and requires a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely distributed as image format . T@@ IFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression @-@ free compression . however , there is more than 50 different types . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative File Format is a free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on T@@ IFF / EP format and required for use of met@@ ad@@ ata . it is a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer D@@ NG now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored in an extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format to archive archi@@ ved . however , it can be related to problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards and support the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera production , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your Ro@@ har@@ chi@@ v . this function is not implemented yet .
for an enemy processing , you can use external programs . if you return the pictures with &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in web galleries , add in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate . in the section , adding a photos to an album you can add a description , how you can already have photos that you already have on your hard drive , but you can add many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator will appear at the bottom and the presentation pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not appear on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to watch the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a details or met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information that are intern@@ ally stored on the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that there are not any information available with some digital cameras .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as EX@@ IF , manufacturer preview , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available with some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into one single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; . when downloading the pictures are not deleted , we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to delete the pictures from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired of the standard input methods of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos , you can download the button and then select the chosen button . the button will be downloaded long until you &apos;ve selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is downlo@@ ad@@ able . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; downlo@@ ad@@ here . if you choose this option , the new pictures are downloaded , of course only the new pictures downloaded .
if you can download or download the buttons , select a dialog with which you can choose the target album , displayed in the photos . list of existing albums will be displayed as normal files you can read in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after having selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; invites photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete any delete button . if you want to delete messages , you need to select it first and delete the delete chosen chosen .
note that there is no way to restore pictures you deleted from the camera . you should not verify that the photos are successful in one &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; -@@ album downloaded , before you want to delete it out of camera . if you want to delete the camera settings , you should make it much faster than this camera .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently not especially meaningful name . this can be deleted again after the photos from the camera was deleted . therefore , it can be sensible , the date and time when the image has been taken to integrate it into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and spe@@ ars of the picture and for dat@@ alog@@ y bases . if you use these latter option , automatically create a folder per day .
the options During the transfer opens three more options , which are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch to the option &apos;s date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ame into small case letters . or in case of capital letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name , displayed the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ ame will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; can use any information on the orientation of the camera to the time @-@ point recording , to perform a automatic rotation during the heart . not all cameras make this information ready . in the side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , it leaves &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
when your camera was done on the date , where the photo was made , it can be &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; this under@@ lines are uploaded to the image data . all cameras with the same date are uploaded into the same album . not all cameras make this information available . in the side@@ bar Meta @-@ Data , you can read what information your camera could be embedded in photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button extended and select the option of the date @-@ based sign@@ age at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button . then select the upload dialog box &amp; K@@ DE . you can then select the files you want to upload the uploaded file . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; you , where the images are uploaded . a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that is indicated in length and lat@@ itude , which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can link it an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environment plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; users want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is well to en@@ rich the position data of a photos .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 offers many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and maps are supported . directly with the correct hardware , via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera which integr@@ ates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recipi@@ ents . either as a card module or by transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . but you have to store these data in the GP@@ X format , as it is the only format to support the geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS used to extract the data from images and of the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs ordered by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , all the navigation details for Europe show .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ f came to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are many att@@ itudes to change the behaviour of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; to set up on these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu . you can change between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left .
in action , you can view or start image editing on embedded preview . you put the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ acy and copyright data . this data will automatically be written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option to download from the camera system . this data is also written with a database synchron@@ isation , this data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . these can be used as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description to the author , this must also be filled .
publishers is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to give the photo . this must not be the author , as such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group should be listed here , then the group / agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the respective IP@@ TC @-@ rim . thereby , the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; . this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; imported without lost .

the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse indicator is in the main window above one file . depending on option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; show , you can add the file expansion of this list and remove any file extensions , which has no one of these extensions , ignored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; igno@@ res .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ous &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; can be set on this page on the default values . any pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can obtain better visibility results .
by default , the image processing used a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ lined areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter color on the image . these colors are fixed here . in the image processing can be inserted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the pictures can be coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next declaration .
with the P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not reducing the image quality , because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time to trigger and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can use this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the T@@ IFF @-@ files option you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression bal@@ m for T@@ IFF files . this reduces the size of T@@ IFF images . it has no influence on image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm uses loss @-@ free .
with the loss of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can los@@ s@@ less store . even if you select the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; the image processing was only one image viewer for photographs . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the idle speed is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light as the pixel at odd @-@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference is a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the picture a bit soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 gene pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the bald is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the bald is not set . default is it a fixed color balance used on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD cameras . using the second sensors , the effect of the second sensors have the effect that sub@@ jug@@ ated images will get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top , so the parts of your pictures are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera shows up , because of the in@@ ability of your camera displays the top speed . finally , you can try to re@@ design some parts of the missing information from the top @-@ light .
this is possible because the blue pixels generally did not work as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ design the missing green and red parts out of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; to keep the time for the demo@@ s , you should be conservative .
a demo @-@ based algorithm is a digital image process to provide a complete picture of the partial image sensor that have many cameras and which have a Matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; and d@@ cra@@ w also put you three alternatives to you : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color documents in the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you will be performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions about it again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; information like the color content of a color space in the other are to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder S@@ etting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; examine these folders then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile to rear . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
the input profile should be used to use the camera manufacturer and model that you can use . not all profiles are contained in the same way . currently there is some , like Canon , which does not have any color ton@@ mapping or gam@@ em@@ correction . currently , it correc@@ ts that you need to perform the tone tone themselves for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are further options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer may have a smaller color area than your camera and some colours , therefore , you might correct , rather than leaving your printer &apos;s blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which paint profile for them is intended for what is intended . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially :
the Canon profile expansion can be seen the style for the purpose : F for an accurate style , L for Land@@ scapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image personnel and image processing is supported . many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , see a list of available modules . select the modules you want , and these modules are then loaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ f . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you can see some of them in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu below Settings .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is the time between image trans@@ itions , normally they are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes switch the met@@ ad@@ ata or out which appears at the bottom end of the pictures during display .
the camera characteristics show a list of all the cameras supported on the left side . if you want to use one camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in image display mode . at present , serial port , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage is supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire cameras ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s , specify your camera on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , remove them in the ad mode .
try out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ uss@@ ing , you can set the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photos and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down through &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without qu@@ eries . otherwise , you must apply changes with the button changes .
you can also sub@@ strate the display of the Welcome @-@ screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; sub@@ strate the starting point of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate under circumstances .
the start@@ up start looking for new photos are forced &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos came out ; if something from the base folder was deleted , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; you know whether it should be deleted from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can select under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in writing a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ sts ; to create , you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; contains a fast image processing with some base tools . you can use these to check your photos and to correc@@ ting and improvement . image processing can be started through a click on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of details / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them stand as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set up in section image processing .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
editing functions can change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before you save file save or the button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo once you have stored the picture .
so you should have a copy of your picture before you change it . this allows you to save file save than .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using from the menu file , or use the button The button restore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last store .
almost every promotion of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can return , by selecting editing or restored , by selecting editing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the key abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press a moment on the back or restore button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions will be re @-@ established or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can use between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar , picture above or the entries in the menu file . if you have made any changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ can menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlargement factor automatically
view Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode . usually , you can then use the tool@@ bar . normally , you can also change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can call it from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; main window . see the section for setup of the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture you can print in the menu file image and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print some pictures or whole phr@@ ases . all image files can be printed from your selection . you must only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exp@@ orting printer assist@@ ent . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected pictures are available . the same side@@ bar is available , also available in image editing . it is displayed if one of the five hor@@ semen is cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
in the venti@@ l@@ ating view , you can enter or insert the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2,000 characters . all comments are being cut off after 2000 characters and special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after which you have commented , you either use the button application or change simply to the next picture , the labels will then be saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this , you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . however , this will always be selected if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings , which is always written into the pictures .
the section review shows a rating sch@@ ema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can always be used with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the key @-@ abbrevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the assessment is written into the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows below the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keyword , the keyword and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; -@@ session installed positions .
the keyword is adapted dynam@@ ically . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom of the lower end is a further relief from the input at a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by trademarks of the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
if more pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword , this only applies to the highlighted image and not to choose the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter .
the side@@ bar code filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed . normally , the left side bar uses their album , - data , sampling and view@@ points . if in addition , one or several sample filter from the right side is used , only the cut quantity of these two are displayed . all keywords are available .
you can also pull out and lay down . suppose you have chosen several images in the main view . if the keyword exists , you can simply draw it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . as a result , a dialogue that you ask if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the sample filter is reduced to no keywords , which was chosen by C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that , a keyword from the right keyword will be taken into the selection and placed there . a dialogue asks if this keyword should be set .
these search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be turned off under settings .
if you have a rule with and create and notice that it should be a or , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , searching for the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or character chain that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a Advanced search via all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then button the button . see the options below :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to back the images in full resolution .
this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I was mainly adapted to &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you can print a color administered workflow , you can achieve the colors on your camera or scanner . with a colored workflow you can achieve that the colors print on your monitor from your camera or scanners are the colors that you print or in the web publish from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons does not need to make for the results he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tut@@ orials is to give you sufficient background information about color management . in addition to you , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired results .
if your image work@@ flows are fulfilled every six below , then you have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ color space . ( more information below )
your only other aspect of images are by e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB of the de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy , why should we use another color space and make your thoughts about color indul@@ g@@ ents ?
a visual example of the lim@@ iting from s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ff@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color flowers , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excellent site and then click on information and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB @-@ color space or not , you need to switch your monitor . if you &apos;re in the color space of s@@ RGB , you &apos;ll need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . use it before attemp@@ ting to try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic and contrast increase from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ating auto correction automatically try to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled down the whole image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible is often used without its color sha@@ ding . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for images which are dark or balanced .
equal : this method is adjusted the lumin@@ ous factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channels is as flat as flat . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contra@@ sts of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ ories .
contrast ratio : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous values of the RGB values of the image by post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new ji@@ re@@ ation of all values . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad pictures .
the tin@@ ge of &amp; di@@ gi@@ z came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white ab@@ duct of one photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is something limited to a color space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can carry out the tin@@ ge in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a tin@@ c@@ law of paste protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . it is starting with the menu entry colors white ab@@ stain@@ ing of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both original image and preview of the target image can be seen . if you want to see the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ ish , then it is enough to click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target audience has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pi@@ pes under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . sha@@ dows alignment allows you to improve the sha@@ dows of your photos or di@@ mming down .
to play with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned checks , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and later on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white @-@ circle . on this type , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the Weiß@@ removable with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ clock detector increases the colours if more than a color channel of the pi@@ per can be over@@ exposed . this is displayed as a pure indicator as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons save as and store just make this . any adjustment of the white plug that you have set you her@@ eby save in a text file and download again later .
the default settings will keep all the filter values back on their default values and corresponding neutral white @-@ comparison list . note that there are also neutral settings a different photo as your original . if you store this , your original picture will be changed .
you can adjust the co@@ effici@@ ents per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding requires also more record , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG for the formats .
this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw pictures . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the Hel@@ lig@@ ations . a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles you can draw the chapter of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu below colours . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so you can always make them the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you find below colours Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; tool colour defects provide you four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter available .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the picture was completed . the colour , dark areas shel@@ tered the delicate tones of dark and colours by the second illumination . this tool was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar panel . at approx . 50 % intensity , the figure shows what is possible to use chem@@ ically . another increase is finally a neg@@ ativity that is not to create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is handled ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contra@@ ction effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simply , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name manufactured by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . this name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strong saturated colors are also made in detail of the choice of natural photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strong saturated colors are also a few photographer , especially those who had hardly any landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on . in large pictures , the filter can lay the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color counter and the lumin@@ ance of your photos with the tools in the menu below colours . once you are satisfied with the results you can use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you can make a photo in bad light conditions , you can reduce the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to increase the satur@@ ation instead of increasing . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ ness / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve exposure of exposure . even if the dialog box is very complicated for this tool , you need to explain the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ o program .
the window contains a graph@@ er of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . among the graph@@ s are three sli@@ ders to change the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the regulator and to watch out how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture may be considered . the preview will be dynamic , updated on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is frequently represented . in pictures the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic distribution is useful .
three regulator : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium tones , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image used to automatically adjust the input of the shadow , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each range . there are also two controls which can be used in order to change the output values , e.g. , the compression of output values can be used as background , while making something different in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : this button will automatically set the images automatically depending on the values of the image .
store as and store : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and later loaded again . the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use these mode and use the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input will be automatically adjusted to all sha@@ dows , means and sun tones . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the preview of the history program for red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ating channels .
the Trans@@ lator &apos;s option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and you indicate the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere Channel : this selection box allows the channel to be used by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera . in this case , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short text to the right , for example , the bright sounds , you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dark pro@@ curement , and that are dar@@ ker imag@@ ery .
on the preview of the original photos is a red selection . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
store as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you can create this in the file system and later be loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p spa format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ ping buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ating curve .
the Trans@@ lator &apos;s option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result , meaning you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below , you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ating canal . shadow and sun tones was set with colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val came ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels , or change the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of the images . you can edit it from the colors @-@ to @-@ mixer for image processing .
you can select the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison on its own rider .
the preview of the target system has a red markers . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to use this channels . if you also activate L@@ umin@@ ance , then the channel bl@@ ender will enable the tool to generate great black @-@ and conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color appears in a visible smoke , which does not appear in the same place in the colour channel and whose sound pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the color@@ less first .
store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer adjustment can therefore store up and then load this file format . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Trans@@ lator &apos;s option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and you indicate the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in the blue channel newly adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step step , since color images can be converted easily on the machine . also with a set of film roll@@ ers profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good from all scen@@ eries and fits especially well to portraits against heaven . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Green filter .
orange @-@ filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and aerial photographs . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ tes .
Rot@@ ary filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ tic effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ eness to day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ary .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates warm bright and medium tones . it is very similar to the process of wearing a pressure and recovery in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture on your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting , a pop @-@ type portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the light and three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text is applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver , tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task . an option to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under image frame , the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter , select the desired frame type with a coloured line , Nie@@ p@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , cover it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : are the width of the frame in percent . the value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture at any spot . this also works at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type text , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need . the bigger the image , the bigger must be the character set . finally , select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . the picture is finished .
every attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool sten@@ cil can apply a template on an image .
the menu image templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates about a picture .
for the template there is no restrictions concerning size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add to maximum compres@@ sing file size . if you want to add your template of the template ; template file to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; mailing list di@@ gi@@ ver @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you &apos;ll need to put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you can copy the template files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder was set for templates , a tree view appears , which reflects the folder structure of the template file . the selection of a folder is automatically updated the template of the template .
below the preview , three buttons can be found with which you can change the enlar@@ ging factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . if you want to use the mouse position . if you want to use the template onto the whole picture , you must reduce the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to shift the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the picture will then be adapted to the front size .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; three different tools are available for sharp@@ ness . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
non@@ sense mask works on the contrast to the edges to make an image shar@@ per . indeed , it is not a little bit more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ geons and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , because he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the resolution , so that sharp edges are printed on paper . the same phenomenon will observe if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than normal cameras for the individuals .
JPEG image has often been used to use internal sharp@@ ening . images in the raw format will always have to be weak@@ ened during processing .
some scanners used a sharp@@ ening filter during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening interface . you can sharp@@ ens your choice with the menu entry .
you should deal with this , as the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening technology increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also intensi@@ fy the noise . in general , it is focused on the menu entry system . under Re@@ focus , you will find further information and comparison with all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a bit soft , is much simpler than it . use the tool to make your soft@@ mark with the menu entry . use the screen window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview can help the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect . if you make the non@@ sense mask , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will generate in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a channel by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radios . you should therefore make images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the promised image that is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is a rup@@ ture of the maximum RGB value and the difference . it can therefore define a minimal difference which is used for a c@@ aching of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen are exemp@@ t and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool Re@@ focus re@@ focus on an image by enh@@ ancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected filter algorith@@ ms from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing quot ; in which it makes a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . the traditional technique is used to sharp@@ ening a non@@ sense mask . re@@ focus is usually better results as un@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can launch it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focus on the image processing .
in practice , the circular f@@ ission is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; slide . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ill has a very long tail , which is widely dependent on the original box . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; spl@@ its in most cases even very strongly influenced by distant pixels . this causes un@@ wanted results .
circular support : this is the most important parameter for use of this module . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should place 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but watch out in Heiligen@@ pons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can be reduced by arti@@ facts . the correlation can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can be able to help arti@@ facts . however , values can be lower than 0.1 . however , values are very bad . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still be added to the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your non@@ sharp@@ ness filter is caused . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation modules . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select big values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters can be set up for later , and can then be loaded .
try all cut , colour and int@@ oler@@ ance c@@ tures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts left .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked results as sharp@@ ening . this could cause it to be bl@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ening .
in theory , there must always be dis@@ sharp m@@ asked . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of non@@ sense . it is practical , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least just as good as the non@@ sense mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters is often better with the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ sharp colour scheme has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for further information on the methods of sharp@@ ening methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator is the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the area that was ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated in order to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour tin@@ plate allows a customized color for the pupils . if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error is one of the most developed tools , to remove the arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the cast algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can also use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
fine post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of details . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass over the picture . a value of 0,9 should be considered that no sharp@@ ening is necessary . please note that the accuracy may always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you create a film gra@@ dient or CCD smoking a high value of the same pattern . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts are best removed at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum value factor via all@@ it@@ p then defines relative smoo@@ thing . therefore put this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is meant to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ b@@ ulation effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : is how often the algorithm run through . usually 1 or 2 is enough .
angle length da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . be sure that small angle should generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value so much possible and for your needs .
integral step length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step length in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you can get through the choice of this option is only low . but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to him .
buttons save as and loading exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later be loaded again .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still be very long and have a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button .
below you can see how pictures are removed with small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film camp during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the di@@ gi@@ ver came ; smoke reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Peter stern .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts which can be used by dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor smo@@ kes of the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of incoming images from books or magazines .
if you require further information about digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain at default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filters are needed and can be spo@@ iled by the radius , and the color in it is smoo@@ ther and thus smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to the front . if it is increased , smokers will change the edges - if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get more and noise or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong is not able to remove the whole space or noise tops can occur . put it to a value near the maximum if you want to lose a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the picture . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that will be controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the picture . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that will be controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ oler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas which are typically stronger , however , the shadow ranges .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the illumin@@ ance . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius can occur on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can appear on the edges . it can remove smokers and is the recommended method for it .
store under and loading : these buttons are used precisely for it . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set , can be stored in the file system and are loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a bit soft , is fortunately much simpler than a picture . use a tool to make your soft@@ mark with the menu entry to the dialog . it shows the effect on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographs .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts to remove any pictures in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the image con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the Tex@@ ture is developed with another tool , the image error correction , developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ .dll and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts Redu@@ ce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this attitude is to correct these problems .
buttons save as and shop do this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then re@@ loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still be very long and have a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button .
below , you can reduce like a photo with a formal noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film baskets on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which have been created by scanning lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot pixel pictures featuring a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw materials photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button . the tool will detect the hot and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you connect the dark directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the correct picture . note that the assistant re@@ not@@ ices the final image and re@@ load this automatically in the next meeting .
the picture section and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ ferences .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is an average of the neighbor pixel . it is assigned to all def@@ ec@@ ules in the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this will be taken separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels made a distance of 1 by Pix@@ el@@ block will be pulled to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel pitch will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less can be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correc@@ ting on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ation , i.e. sub@@ jug@@ ated corners , to correct one image .
wide angle lens , in particular the medium and large photo format , often the entire sensor range can not evenly illumin@@ ate the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ Ob@@ jective will also show this behaviour in circumstances .
but it has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise accidents effects are generated through movement .
with the large exposure of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by sim@@ ulating an equi@@ valence transformation of a raw material that is used without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correction applies to the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or randomly to compens@@ ate the density by a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ing , reduce it by a small degree of dam@@ aging .
leu@@ k@@ ness , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correction reduces the signal strength of the pixel . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target file with these options , as you only need to increase your settings .
if you want a more subtle novel@@ ty of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; image processing out of the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction for a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the v@@ icious p@@ adding in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture . an inhibit@@ ing and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the di@@ gi@@ val came ; lenti@@ cular dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . coloured dist@@ ortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is treated with the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of lens and can be corrected the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , fla@@ w@@ less to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the Ko@@ efficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion is almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion part of the second degree . with negative values can be corrected tons @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion and positive values are ho@@ ver@@ ized dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion @-@ degree . this value affects more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls the &apos; corners &apos; has the converted sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value is reset the image size and thereby decreasing a correction of first degree . negative values increase while positive the image resi@@ zed .
brigh@@ ten : this value is adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the dist@@ ortion correction . the values that you are using for your image are stored and the next start@@ up will be used as default values .
the cargo / or cus@@ hion Cor@@ rection should be carried out in front of all random or size changes . if you are best to cut this correction than all the first . if you have a painting new , the effect would be the effect evi@@ dently of fal@@ se@@ hood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool will show you a vertical and horizontal lines . move it to an important place , like the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in connection , you can correct the handle / ho@@ ver@@ le dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cus@@ hion dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the random tool in the menu transformer or remove them from the image processing or zoom control of this dialog .
for most pictures the cy@@ c@@ ous correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves , such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings is the perspective to correct the all angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the c@@ ann@@ ular correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of G@@ enn@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has an Sens@@ itive range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for a preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters set to sim@@ ulate footage and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO controls changes the amount of film baskets and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filters are mixed for the re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared profile based on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the light .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; filter film grains is a simple to use tool to re@@ produce film baskets on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , well @-@ known . to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer great sil@@ vers@@ ner of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny appearance especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for control of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of grains . the default value is , although higher values need to be used , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film body effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is equal to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are ideal for large pictures . smoo@@ thing the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and plain 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to define a carbon@@ ic@@ iz@@ ze . the lines whose gra@@ dient are slowly changed and therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you would have chosen what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch out . this would be good pictures to catch them .
there are two regulator with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon record filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result may still be improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; filters engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure , in which color does not use the most important on content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ umental landscape .
the depth allows the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effect . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : split the image into cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by accident effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the picture along st@@ ern@@ al lines that go out of a focal point . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the picture through rotation of the pixels around a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance protection : wi@@ ping the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera in@@ se . the object seems to re@@ sign back in the background .
movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the picture through horizontal movements of pixel . this sim@@ ulates the infin@@ ity of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft@@ ener un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ping the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or add a warm and subtle light .
Sag@@ itt@@ arius : wi@@ ping the picture through random shift of pixel and sim@@ ulates the non@@ sense of being arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent In@@ shar@@ fe : finds the paint basin in the picture and wi@@ ping them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time using the button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . as a result , it gives natural your pictures a fine appearance . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorith@@ ms .
drop size does not allow the size of the dri@@ p size . as the drop size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures . number changes the amount and density of drops . fish pe@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drops on the image .
you can hold with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; image processing is free of rain@@ drops . use the range of tools to select the area , e.g. a face that will be free to choose . if you have to run the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ression filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by s@@ ke@@ wer or turning into the right orientation . the tools you will find in the menu transformer , turning transformer .
photo flo@@ ats is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture of shr@@ inking is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture that can be found in an image ? how can you find the missing information , or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here , makes a good job here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm team has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider &apos;s new size and are listed below :
specify aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size will maintain the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is meant to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
buttons save as and store are used precisely . any deposit for photo can enlarge can be saved as text file and later be loaded again .
photo v@@ ases is very fast with what it does , but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see an example for photo v@@ ases by a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlarged by comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . in order to cut a photo simply just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw up the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle , while you move the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photos will cut off is out . as a result , you can change the size of the area to cut off the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the accessories , use the button of the button editing in the tool bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file save or file save under the menu file to save the re@@ designed photo .
in the presentation area , you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains .
in the tool , after the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross format . in the high @-@ size , the greater value of the height and the width is assigned .
the tool aspect ratio is an relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you use centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below the dialog , you can set with the Max . ratio button for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation , place .
the tool , according to aspect ratio , saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you are stored for the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will be re@@ mir@@ ro@@ red and not the original picture .
the settings of the gathering help allow help to set up your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden center : the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus , or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to design your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you combine your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the un@@ standing divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule will be regarded as visually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center provides liqu@@ e@@ fied aux@@ iliary lines if you connect a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ re@@ gel , the golden spiral is generated a liquid line of the eye through the picture , this type of composition leads along the line of spiral and creates on this type a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something to create the golden spiral . it may be a line or different objects . this thing can only be there without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden triangles are also derived from the top of the golden spir@@ als . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the golden tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to this lines can place an static object .
if you are using golden triangles in order to break up your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ section and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ ally mirror and vertically can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color you can set the colour of the aux@@ iliary lines . if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast , the aux@@ iliary lines can be invisible . on this type , you can adjust the colour of your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . you can repair it with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; image editing and tool @-@ free rotation . select the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ p@@ angle . the values on this sli@@ p@@ case are indicated in degrees . with the button settings you can set the sliding again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right .
to help your help , the module is available free rotation a horizontal and vertical line . after you move it via an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot a picture , you &apos;ll find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility to repair it is the function transformer cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tra trans@@ formations are carried out to a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the top : shows the current angle at the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right : shows the current angle at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after the adaptation of the perspective , the picture will be a little bit . for individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments produce twice as strong effect , and you should avoid it if possible .
after reading the perspective , you get unbe@@ atable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is the image with transformation cut out of the image processing .
the tool is used to shift a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side . this is no turn , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformation sciss@@ ors .
attach your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you are on default , the angle is displayed at zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the presentation area .
to help your help become a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after taking the shots , the picture will wi@@ ping a bit . for a single loop this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots are twice as much dist@@ ortion and therefore you should avoid this .
after dra@@ ining the image has un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with transformation cut out of the image processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ f came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , of the type like this libraries comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on their system . but they are always JPEG and T@@ IFF on them .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; displays only files in formats . this happens by file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list , you can change this list of file expansion up &amp; di@@ gi@@ . . in the section , you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras can even be used to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression method on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ thing results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IFF on the raw material converter ; you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports the store of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; with her@@ eby more than 200 raw file formats supported . all cameras can be shown below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but it is not a movie processing program and is therefore not able to view or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies to launch the program for playback .

K@@ IP@@ I Module can be exported to a series of pictures into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you fit the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four adjustments with the white module .
many tools you need to work in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; contain their description here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft signs , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc . use a single dialog type that will be applied in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the incident . these Mo@@ di are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected pre @-@ viewing area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pre @-@ viewing area .
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the screen area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to display over@@ - and under@@ floor . used colors to be adapted in the general location page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from a preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the picture and take the part of the picture you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all entries from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
this rider is an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull out a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this is of course taking your pictures ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and to select and ren@@ ame colors .
the pall@@ ets files installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined colors and last used colors .
in the dialogue range , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or bro@@ wse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse at the pressing lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the check box is insert to cur@@ sor under the button color , the colour is inserted either or translated one another ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode allows you to adjust the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection which was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end character , if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the pal@@ let and output of colour selection can be pulled with the mouse .

&amp; graphical viewer : a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize Graph@@ ene &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions .
the &amp; graphical viewer ; -@@ project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program .
&amp; graphical viewer : a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s and graphic programs ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a modification of the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s re calcul@@ ates and in &amp; graphical viewers ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graph@@ s in &amp; graphical viewer ; open in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component
loading of big graph@@ s ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to depic@@ t more than these knots )
additional required software : &amp; graphical viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program that requires the &amp; graphical ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s are required . in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in its own window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; co@@ graph@@ er ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen . in this case , the tool bar contains only the icon file and the ( blank ) list of last modified files . Click on the first icon to display the dialog file .
after you have a or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
when the file shows in &amp; graphical viewer ; charged file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; graph@@ er viewer . if you want to change your decision later , you may want to change your decision later , you can use the menu Settings menu . use ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; graphical viewer ; file instance open , &amp; eg ; in file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphical viewer . instance , want to open or want to pose the instance of the graph@@ s in a sub @-@ window .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but these can also change with the setup dialog .
when program starts , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can change your choice as well as later .
you can also define how the Graph should be split up to several sides . the number of the horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be attached to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph@@ s .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head @-@ line and with another font
the page again gives the possibility to determine the behavior if a file has changed on a hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening speci@@ fies the behaviour of &amp; graphical viewer . when a graph is opened outside a current meeting . you can open a default behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window or in a lower window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked .
the site seating management gives the possibility to determine the starting behaviour of &amp; graphical viewer . you can set up a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you start afterwards .
the context menu , usually with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; appears , further possibilities are opened :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorith@@ ms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graphical vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for related graph@@ s . the algorithm uses hierarch@@ ical or trained represent@@ ations of related graph@@ s . the algorithm lays down the edges to the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce short edges and few edge measures .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ Algorith@@ m is the standard for Hungarian graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the jumping class model . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm created for Hungarian graph@@ s a spr@@ inting model layout . it uses Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ fs , and includes a multi @-@ trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ Algorith@@ m as@@ signs the node @-@ shaped to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . he is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures .

image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you cor@@ related to the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialogue appears . in order to load a possible correlation with GP@@ X file , you &apos;ll need to download a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data from the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , an automatic cor@@ correlation was performed in red . GPS track data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera is to be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the deviation for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera . lies the deviation , among them the data are merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one place , you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large difference between camera and GPS lies , you can place this limits and then cor@@ relate the button .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialogue set the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data at the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and fill in . select the right region and enlarge it again , until you have a passing accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite images and a mixed mode .
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML page . the character set is encoded UTF @-@ 8 to enable a possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders which can be adapted to HTML . these albums are allowed to select all albums . these albums are not hierarch@@ ically indicated . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the record look and the text of the lyrics of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self explained . if you click on a picture , a new page will also be displayed on the image . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer , cover ; screen show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated pictures . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a base image file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled on the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can use a background colour for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that will be packed into MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can launch the module via ex@@ tras MPEG di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting to the list or contents of the list .
after you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are selected using the video format , select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the image is defined . the speed of the image is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth surface change .
the background colour can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file can set you under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , this is integrated into the film . after you can boot all settings your wishes , you can easily drink the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can easily drink or drink a coffee , if you are back again .
if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button below .
the printing assistant allows several pictures to print on a paper paper together in standard phot@@ oc@@ ulars . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g makes sense to improve or print using the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import / or convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file , and then select the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can consider the effect of your current settings to the image .
you can now reset the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white . the main parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion value . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file size .
the tagged Image format , T@@ IFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W Com@@ pressed .
in case you have to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format , since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG image format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file , in the JPEG image , are stored in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to break this process again , you can use it .
the stack @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode therefore if you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , it is helpful if this is created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix to set the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amps .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image and increase the image of the image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . width or height of the picture is automatically chosen , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : magn@@ itude change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option to adapt your image to screen format .
not proportional : non proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , boundary size and background colour is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before . more pictures can drag and place on the list of pictures .
after you started the module , the pictures window with the pictures displayed in selected images are displayed . you can add more images to the displayed images . for the last selected image , a preview of the page is displayed .
you can also drag images to the picture list and add in order to add a list of images to sen@@ ing pictures .
remove pictures from the list of visible pictures from the list of imag@@ ined pictures .
after you have selected all the pictures , you can open the New message windows your e @-@ mail clients . you have to add only the addresses and the subject . these pictures are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure to send a lot of pictures on once . most e @-@ mail accounts recei@@ vable restrictions on the size of the e @-@ mails . there may be a good idea to send emails when you want to send a lot of images .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is stored and returned every time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ Mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format among the menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best to use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures of file format and the original files in JPEG format will then be added to the original ex@@ if@@ config to sen@@ ate images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed , in search of errors , you can view . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically shut down at the end . with the button lets you get this window sh@@ lie ? en .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have presented your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions in the presentation use very elegant image trans@@ itions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own an appropriate graphics card , otherwise the di@@ ves@@ au will be very slow .
the file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop indicates that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can manually start using Es@@ c .
the images are randomly chosen to choose the pictures displayed in a random order . so it won &apos;t be the sequence of images in the album .
in delay between the pictures you can set the temp@@ oral distance between the single pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should try to show the presentation of your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . random in each transition between the pictures a different effect .
during sealing , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
with this tool bar you can stop and launch the presentation , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
on the left lower screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

with the options in the lower part of the window , you can bro@@ wse all the pictures on certain names as you can see in the picture . here , in pictures , in which Jes@@ per but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user guide for &amp; photo album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and watch the quick entry , screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo album ; and select the demo album , if you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry to a photo album ; -@@ demo . as a result , some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this glue you can see here : . as the name suggests , this surro@@ unds you give you data about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . you can then change another unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the LEICA only 10 @-@ minute @-@ sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively using the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview of the database ( if you select a date , the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview ) .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the sched@@ ules , you &apos;ll only see pictures of this period . you can break the selection , by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo album ; offers you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures ; the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other than module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user guide , the integrated version is written to create the HTML ...
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area will be described more accurately .
first , enter the title of over@@ lap and a description that should contain the HTML @-@ file later . on a photo album ; HTML example page , you see an example of this settings .
next you choose whether a &amp; photo album ; -@@ Export file is supposed to be created on the review page . nour@@ ishing information about export files can be found in .
last you can select what information on the HTML pages must be displayed . as a result , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , that all pictures of a party are obvious . for example , you can &apos;t use all pictures of a party . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewer .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages are to look like . most installation possibilities are unique , which is why not specifically received .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . thus , those you have to consider using your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no images can download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer at your site can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore be fixed your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as well . if it wants to be a larger image , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this installation area , place the various folders and the URL , where your website is stored .
best you choose a base folder for all your HTML files and each subsequent set a new sub @-@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder , in which all your pictures are stored . this folder will be saved and select the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can verify that this really can choose all of the viewer . if you have been created for the base folder , a web browser has started . the URL , which you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files are not yet in the final destination folder you need to copy them manually . thus , the import function , see , correct , you need to specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all sub @-@ folders are located .
the settings described above are related all three on basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ folder was created , whose name is set up in output folders .
if you are looking forward to a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can , of course , you might need a HTML page to view the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work is not even going to do .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import and imports others in your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether the images can be stored in the file , that you may have all images in the file , and this file can be so independent . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file from either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file search the pictures on a double way . first , images are not found in the folders of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , you are searched for creating the HTML files . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for the export of images is described , which you can export via the menu file .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
in case of manual the .@@ k@@ im file , you &apos;ll need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo album ; images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it normally doesn &apos;t want to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit . if you are sending your friends pictures , you would like to send the pictures maybe not in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can say that each image is to be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impulse ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo album ; the exported database as described in written .
the assistant to import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want , after that , in which file the import images should be copied .
it can be that you can person@@ alize the category persons to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is required for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialogue window and comply with what categories comply with these categories in your database .
in the fourth step you can get the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture .
it must be simple to search pictures and look at : when you look at pictures , you often want to watch out of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you are looking for example images of your Italy holiday and watch a picture with your friend to discover , you may want to see all the images that this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will receive the various steps of ( 1 ) fixed information on your pictures , via ( 2 ) the search and pre@@ stige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
photo album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been expanded and today your videos . at many places in this manual will be talked about images , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top file of their pictures . this is an easy XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male securing tools , copy to a disk or revisions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; photo album ; not@@ ices the folder , in which your pictures are stored and use this with future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo album ; for example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry ( photo album ) you can set up to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album . in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you the various settings options .
to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call for a preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , you can install a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option .
it was described in you how to create different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , e.g. all members of a group on once in a group instead of all groups of a mid@@ town .
in view the settings options available to you for fixed the membership groups . you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; divi@@ des his module system with other graphics applications , such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . nour@@ ishing information on this site you can find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves .
since the modules can be used together with several applications , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo album are only very little tested . so you should use new modules first with the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ box \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I can be very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you shares functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order does not support , it will sim@@ ulate the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo album ; the current album , which is just the current view , thus all the pictures you look at the picture preview .
besides the current album , &amp; photo album has to be handed over ; the modules also has a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category you &apos;ve specified in the application dialog as category for virtual albums , for example , if you want to use the category people , will do &amp; k@@ photo album ; so do you want to add persons to view and give it to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the module dialog , and select the modules , which modules are to be loaded .
in the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo album ; with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the above one menu and tool bar . at the moment we see no information about your pictures . in the section we will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will now click on this window , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo album ; is the opportunity to view each image with notes on the image , where the image has been recorded . you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all images , Jes@@ per and all the images were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and bro@@ w@@ sen as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in see three lists with a text box by setting up persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; since you will always use them when you enter your pictures .
the following idea is based on the list of images within the list . if you are depicted for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be found , so you can find the names mentioned above , find the persons faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to receive a alphabetical list , click on the icon for sorting according to the list below .
if you have chosen notes for each image individually , you might need to edit all selected pictures and have these images with comments . Click in this case simply click the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture above .
if you have several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all those pictures and use the menu button more than once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the United States . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as an over@@ line . to show you , it is a special symbol displayed .
in the context menu of the association dialog@@ s it is possible to add a record to a existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry into a category and take this entry to this entry . attention , this is predicted that you just sort your categories of alphabetical order . see also .
you can move the individual elements of the association dialog@@ s to form , click and move the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by drag him outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs to be satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also send a frame completely out . if you want to get this window again later , use the button options ... and then click window a / out . this process will be shown in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with the pictures of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you do not have a filter . for example , you can see the size of th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply after pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it just times .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is decorated as background picture for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window is created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and press either the remove button or select in menu Edit . now , you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures stored on the disk . of course you &apos;ll have to record the images somewhere , so you can download images from &amp; k@@ photo album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo album ; if not all required pictures of the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut off , the pictures are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the th@@ umb@@ nails are present , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can view this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see , you need to copy files from the folders and to copy them again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid the insert of the right CD . if you want to avoid trouble , like the passage of your images , please buy a larger drive to store all the images .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy you would like to stay in the end of those who want to see for others un@@ accessible and click all the pictures you can see your little sister , control and select the menu entry everything except for above view .
thus , you have set out what images are hidden in the case of the case . if you put the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry into your little sister . if you want to select the pictures you need to be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click to lock out .
it is also possible to establish a password that must be entered for un@@ locking the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this image protection is not very safe . to one , you can read or delete any pictures on the disk and to the other can read the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this kind of password protection is only used to illustr@@ ate those who have with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to resist the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; of course , and hours over hours there@@ with , of course , you want to consider them sometime . for this reason &amp; photo album has a picture _ and video link . this can be seen from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the viewer . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all information you have on the image , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is shown on the upper part of the picture you can see this easy with the mouse , you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is shown . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then you can see the context menu , you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this show . if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several pictures in the viewer , you can easily switch between them and go back to jump the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; photo album ; how often it can press a new image after a few seconds . as often it can press a new image by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus the buttons through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of viewing &amp; photo album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can use in the picture and zoom out with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button you can check out the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . it shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point @-@ button you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the balance links the zo@@ oms , so each pixel is equal to pixels of a picture of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ a@@ ste are .
with the context functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the actual picture with the menu note from the context menu .
if you look at pictures you can pass a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . but you &apos;ll probably prefer to mark the image and look further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what pictures you want to start with the pictures and see them as good or bad , while you &apos;re looking one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you are viewing . features include the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in view , you &apos;ll see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have placed features on your pictures , you &apos;ll be able to print them in your browser . if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be shown in the presentation view . if you can view the categories in D@@ re pre @-@ view , you can press features to the pictures by simply press the characters for the feature , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint &amp; k@@ photo album ; on the picture .
the painting is not stored in the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your painting later .
in case you can see a picture on the painted picture . in order to switch the painting of &amp; photo album ; turn on the painting with the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top on the window .
in order to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ vy ; you have to rule the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you necessarily have read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model view .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously , but not the object &apos;s object already selected , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position you want to insert the object and select either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple locations , the following line @-@ up menu is embedded , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have properties change , click on users to take these changes . if you invali@@ date invali@@ d values , a message appears with an error description . then you can ti@@ fy the input command and click on users or cancel the changes with break .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; application documentation in setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you are a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of the self @-@ economic view .
press a preview of the scene and a small example of the scene is added to the chosen texture . if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element . if you only want a part of texture ( for example , texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
the screenshot displays the camera control points . you can draw these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling through the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visual set . you can specify this value relative to the viewing level of the above object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level of smaller or equal to the scene chosen in the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object properties will be displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can also store multiple window orders and change between different arrangements .
to insert a window via or under a view , drag the text to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , head to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends across the total height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , you prefer to change the text in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card bund@@ les above in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , go to the top in mind or click on the small , pointing to the top right arrow .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the shape bar . to prevent the cup@@ board , click the small square between arrows and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sh@@ amed , you can also anchor them in any location .
the current window view can store you with view window order ... store . it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window order below an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering this program must be right installed . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool bar or select the menu entry in the scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . it determines image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you may agree to many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of full pictures .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender ( in the tool bar or in the menu view R@@ ender modes ... ) , the following dialog will be opened :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name to detect the properties of mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the check box section and enter the image section to ren@@ dering into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ction lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a painting with just one beam per pixel is en@@ ched , different errors may arise . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ ffed effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these mistakes . generally , pictures with this feature better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam of pixel . if the difference between the color values is checked , both pixels are calculated by tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you comp@@ utes the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated on a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel will be shared into 4 sub@@ pixel size , which can be examined individually and further details . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn j@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern .
the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a very long way to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object taken .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file impulse ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet not the complete command @-@ range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ vy ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from object @-@ tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it adds to the source file in the editor file . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source text editor and drag him to the object @-@ tree .
with copying and insert into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er is ren@@ ders ; usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the Own view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . put here the path to your re@@ tention and version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ tim@@ ings ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you enter files , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points .
the color of the rectangle of the view@@ point in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
you can set the catch @-@ catch of points on the buttons in the context menu of the wire model @-@ view . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and rot@@ ations .
larger values give up a more precise wire model and thus a better se@@ wing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detail stage for two directions .
when you cross high accuracy for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection , all projections with exceptions are the perspective and vertical projections . this feature makes a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is placed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a soil is enclosed below the objects . the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate cant@@ een , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering scenes is used . the values for the depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window frames will be explained , as you can create window orders and store .
the Combin@@ ation field Standard window order : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of window frames shows all existing window frames . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear , and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views on the selected window order . new views can add and select select views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the available window , with un@@ folded , you &apos;ll receive a card bund@@ le view together with the previous view and sli@@ p@@ end . view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; inst@@ alls and now you want to follow without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this tut@@ orial , you should create the ultimate but easy to use : a ball at one level .
but you should consider following war@@ nings , before you compl@@ ain about it that you can only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied as a result , you will receive a black picture .
if you do not insert a light source , your whole scene is in the dark and you will just receive a black picture .
if you have any faul@@ t@@ less installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable presentation of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you create . in particular , note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object @-@ tree now includes a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , see the contents of the view object properties , in which the various parameters of the camera find . in user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved . but note that the camera can change in view of the camera , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left mouse button and drag him to the desired position .
if you press the button application or the input , the wire model views and the object @-@ tree immediately change this settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could set up a cube ( insert end@@ able body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a reverse way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as bottom :
a good advice : choose the plain in object @-@ tree , change the name and then press the button application or the input lines . in the object @-@ tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view now shows the level even though at the moment only as limited data level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object @-@ tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal line , just so you can meet some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows :
select the floor only to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog can be placed in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose the name in object @-@ tree view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you &apos;ll see how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a m@@ ist black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities for the pig@@ ment . however , there are again many possibilities , but take the easiest way now .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you ren@@ dering your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you have to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this once , but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the object @-@ tree jed@@ es@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should already be able to run , as you have the basic working mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; already understood . the ball is just as easy as the floor create :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the entry button or to push the button ) , so the ball has delayed contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would float above the floor , as you have moved the floor to bottom .
of course , the Ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears as a m@@ ist black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you select the ball , you can now prove a material now . as already in the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
dial the main object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . Click on ball pig@@ ment , then select disposable and put the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to put some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input .
the brightness she@@ en effect and reflection result already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal are not selected :
you should have a good impression now , which possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you capture a scene , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical Ra@@ ys from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources are reflected in the scene and as atmospheric effects as for example fog . so the scene is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye to see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be ger@@ ated , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the Standard file dialog , you can select one file that you have with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and a disk space .
sets the scene again in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry , if you are not yet stored in the scene .
repe@@ ats the last back@@ sliding command . you can only select this menu entry , if you use Edit properties .
stores the current window order and opens a dialogue in which you enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the keys and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can add to this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog for the tool@@ bars . you can add to this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a possibility to make rough surfaces , without any bending on the surface individually modeling and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as a colour card .
&amp; cozy show ; is a comfortable image courtesy and browser . the application has a file browser which you can select pictures to display .
pictures can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or image mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return will display .
you can set if any picture is displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures are always supposed to use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the file in the browser window . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is emphas@@ ized . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog setting - &amp; result show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General , and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work@@ ings of &amp; check show ; set in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the keys for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area with the background colour is filled , which you can set up below . default is not a full screen mode .
if this point is activated , downloads &amp; comp@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in folder , while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; show show ; when ordering the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , opening &amp; show show ; this folder in bro@@ w@@ driver window .
Click on the coloured beams to select a background colour . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , also the background is filled with the selected colour .
you can &amp; reduce show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is switched on the full screen size . this option is switched as default .

the best start to join in &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions for entry to the developers mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options to change the behaviour of &amp; show photo ; to set up on these settings you need to set up in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings , press on the symbols of the left side .
in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the colour that is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ bel@@ ive resistance should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ry should display the colours with what you should indicate , in contrast to a bright color , and over@@ lay a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also view this page , in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; it is an application to scan images that no more makes images to scan and add .
&amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that can no more makes images to scan and save the images . if you can open a dialog to save or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images prior to the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane @-@ project page by insert the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; qu@@ ite ; with the command line -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is un@@ opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog will be opened to selecting the scanner .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop breaking &amp; qu@@ int@@ ite ; stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not apply these options .
to can@@ ve a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ ju@@ can and then select scanning area for the final scan . the Pre@@ she@@ et@@ can start through the preview button .
to get the picture better , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview can fit into the window .
when the picture was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you have chosen a preview of the Settings option , the picture will appear in a preview window , as shown below , then the picture will be saved and lie ? en leads to a break and you get back into the main window .
through the button , the ep@@ onymous dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can look at the picture if desired , before the Save . in this case , the option must be selected on the store . if this preview of the user is not requested , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way to them . dialog for storing any image opens the dialog before each image file . if &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined file , then you must ask save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored in the option save without after a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder is used as standard for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture @-@ pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for storing . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric view@@ mix of every time when an image is stored . the string bag # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value changes the compression value for storing . if you select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; - Hand@@ book . the button above starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings will be used for the settings and connections can be used to end &amp; qu@@ ite ;
&amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; may be used under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; use such a list of these cuts and its function . below , you can set up a list of these cuts and its function . you can set up with the right mouse button in the player window and select the button of button . select the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... select .
you may also set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . thus make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP function could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ sharing options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check your script as if all required modules are available and use it dialog , so the user reference why a script is not running .
beginning of the &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in folder scripts / templates , you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ a and Amar@@ a . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; function is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here , an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts will monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use .
configure . configure the script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder on the folder where all data are stored .
tra@@ ck@@ change signals that a new piece is used . the script will now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : sub@@ mitting the path to the selected files of play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be used to remove the script to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 If only the script packages can be used with the extended amar@@ oc@@ script . from this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang the link to the Viking scripts page of &amp; amar@@ ok . you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio Player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can easily pull music into the play@@ list instead of moving through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos; s Colle@@ ctions browser and the quick @-@ search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if your choice is still difficult to select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , you can choose to hear your music . this and still many more useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
typically you have to enter the following folders from Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok to comp@@ ile and install :
da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have any difficulties when compiled . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; just like most applications you can activate or dis@@ able the configure time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met , so that they can be used . details are required in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates deb@@ ug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can set up without trouble on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cart@@ on cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok .
in addition , the player window switches off to the play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed .
voting barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . the option turns the experimental function of the voting barrier .
adap@@ table full : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . therefore , the used color scheme for the mood barometer is changed .
place files from the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folders of &amp; amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : allows you to choose the browser of &amp; amar@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
other brows@@ ers use : you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
play@@ list when saving , save the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , it will use &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage place of the play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
each piece of the piece changes are visible , that the play@@ lists window is up / rolled , to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
when changing the context of the context @-@ browser , automatically shows the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is used .
in the section appearance , you can adapt &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part in three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok . you can choose writings for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press on ID ... , so you can choose any font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom colour scheme , you own even the odds of choice and you can design@@ ate your own color scheme . in addition , use them activated color sel@@ ections for front and background colour .
play at the start , that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program starts automatically , playback the piece automatically , with which it was stopped for the last notice .
the sub@@ panel on @-@ screen display allows you to insert the inser@@ ts of the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , it is displayed a preview of the O@@ SD and you can consider the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . Click on selecting ... to choose from dialogue the desired font to be selected for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow is shown that the text in the O@@ SD is displayed .
in own colours , you can use the option to adapt the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color faces open the dialog for color selection . if you don &apos;t activate the colors , the default &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used .
the input panel display shows the text in the O@@ SD , which can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available space available and what they mean .
the screen size is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can set the screen to which monitor a multi @-@ cav@@ ity environment should appear to the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the radio box . some drivers will enable further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to search for a folder to the collection , mark the check box in addition to its name . this section also includes check@@ boxes , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder re@@ ital@@ ic : this causes &amp; amar@@ ok , both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folder to music .
change changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on modifications ( e.g. if your music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all @-@ related play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ omas and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection , then later added to play@@ lists .
the part of the collecting database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another setup is required in the MySQL facility .
the MySQL database is used for entry to the database for &amp; amar@@ ok . under machine : the computer is set on which the MySQL database is used . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is achie@@ vable . name : is the database name to which the connection is produced .
use your us@@ ername : and password : specify the data for the connection to the database .
the card @-@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server , and when needed music recommendations concerning the current volume .
here you will enter your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces and updating the profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar per@@ formers : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list with similar per@@ formers will be retri@@ eved in each piece . note : you can see the list in context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio Player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen photographs .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained , because &amp; amar@@ ok ) . we have written a small guide , such as K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD is predic@@ table that your window manager will work for fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to assist am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang out the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of this is the fact that Tag@@ li@@ b is part of reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then you can try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , but Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this means that the met@@ a @-@ information can be compiled .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able you automatically turn off when in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is the fact that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 to met@@ a @-@ info , but this is not known as Unicode files . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &apos; The $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ day &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ day = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ day ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ E &apos;s install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can fix the status disabled in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . please note that in some cases up to three times you can click on a symbol until this setting has its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : cy@@ c@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel .@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ ec@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
in order to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .conf so that am@@ aro@@ K will find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are ligh@@ test among the help of experts your uni@@ x or Linux distribution . you can also seek help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error , if there is something in the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok , only a blank play@@ list appears . how do you come into musi@@ c@@ els there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it in ex@@ tras .
the importance of these icons has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 fast For@@ ward : stars are available for the review by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces in the play@@ list the assessment list must be displayed . Click on the title track and select column display . Click here to set the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button to your selection and then select from play@@ list from the boot menu .
drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them drop it there , just as you would do it with other files . so easy is that : - )
in the play@@ list , directly next to adding button , you can save the button . Click on it .
presumably you are missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; re . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . moreover , you can find it via the menu bar at ex@@ tras Equalizer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s right ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question are supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty much more possible audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG !
it may be ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default no MP3 decoder can be supplied ( from patented reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input a@@ ste
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ mb@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be used simultaneously . this can be used by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . check the help mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may have to specify another S@@ ink ( e. g. oss@@ sink ) .
that &apos;s done &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media will need to de@@ code first . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little Over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly on AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper is set to :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause gest@@ ure playback . read this mistake report . the En@@ large of the sound d@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analytical and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less applications react the visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok off . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Z@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Store ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ ad@@ am@@ big@@ config file , and perform G@@ ST @-@ register again . now start &amp; amar@@ ok .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of stor@@ my and thereby causing a lot of trouble reports .
presumably &amp; amar@@ ok was compiled ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you need to recon@@ figure &amp; install .
now I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
presumably use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developers are missing . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you have to re@@ comp@@ ile &amp; install again .

under the tool bar , you can find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folder with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which correspond not your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar which allows you to enter music from a set URL . if you can access music from a set URL . now you can pull music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can draw the music from there to the play@@ list .

if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; amar@@ ok will look for entries , which contain all search terms . if you enter two three entries , search will find all entries , one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , it is sought after entries , which contain either the one or another search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , the spaces include , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ go@@ ings : Mike Old@@ field . thus , following entries , Mike Old@@ field does not contain , but not after entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search engine , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : review : &gt; 50 This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece which does not contain a certain search term , make a minus sign before the search term : - something looking for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ men@@ ities according to each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then get a label with a number . number is the order , in which the pieces will be restored .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program is burning audio or data CD @-@ Rs in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ Rs . therefore , choose &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically sel@@ ects &amp; cd@@ record ; usually automatically achieved &amp; cd@@ record ; usually reached &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; but a higher quality at burnt audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a perfect open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a well developed MP3 decoder used to compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial encoding . lame is used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD .

V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a featured system @-@ equipped car system for editing , assem@@ bling and analyze video CDs and Super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of different albums may cause un@@ beautiful effect , which will be different according to the music pieces .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and play automatically all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . Click on a record opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog box is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same when you &apos;d cry for each single project file .
closes the current project . if a project changes and still not stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then switch between stores and modifications . furthermore , you can also stop off and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should happen to happen , the same as if you had called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each of the stored project , it is asked what to happen if you would have called on the file .
if you call this entry , you can select about the upcoming dialogue files to the project . that &apos;s the same effect when you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear at the base folder of the CD .
the dialog &quot; burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button of burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burning dialogue lets only open when the project contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is this ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry is only published on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD . it is always thought to be used for you to see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature demonstrates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
open the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows you to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a picture of a CD which you can then burn sometime later . you should also prefer to copy c@@ ann@@ ons if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this also allows the possibility to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the help of copying dialog . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the help of copying dialog . furthermore , the target medium has to be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source of source in the original form .
open the dialogue to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
open the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to write the choice between writing modes and create .
burns a previously featured CD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning dum@@ b . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously tested DVD image . the dialog asks you after an * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning bend .
a previously sold DVD video can be converted to you . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used straight below . it contains information about the read video , co@@ di@@ bility settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black ra@@ iling .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is shown in the table view and contain properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small glue will appear at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
sh@@ uts the folder view or from . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking of the drive or dis@@ card of the media .
sh@@ uts the content view or out . the remaining view allows the select and drag of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder .
switch the head @-@ edge in the project view or off . the cop@@ ste is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view is open projects . the cop@@ ste has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window for changing the keyboard arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key arrangement below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , the correct per@@ missions are required for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , therefore you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . here , general program settings can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on hi@@ fting . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alise and to adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ Interface . with the help of this interface , parts can be controlled via a sh@@ utter script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions for use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which one of the technical programs will give you .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to make the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be used to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have created all &amp; K@@ DE ; the program supports , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts are described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ dible Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) , D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) , D@@ COP@@ C@@ d ( ) , D@@ COP@@ C@@ d ( ) , D@@ COP@@ D@@ vd ( ) , D@@ COP@@ D@@ vd ( ) , D@@ COP@@ D@@ vd ( ) , D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f .
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can generate a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) . using this reference , it is possible to modify the project via using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference , it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface , which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
half cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String ) , P@@ add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String @-@ ) , P@@ add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ string path ) , ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) , set@@ default ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT case / fo@@ o / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ o@@ ily : is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; K@@ DE ; . with him , you can read the audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder of the computer installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ ily : is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders , which are supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) . other co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile yourself . but if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary for example . if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
which code / file format should be used ? the Chap@@ ters Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction about co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sive factors .
a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , it is not possible to cra@@ ck the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid simply the purchase of Cop@@ ier Audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained to the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which body programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ D@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands from the main window . on the page , step by step is more information , such as this program is used as well as screen photographs with descriptions of the tab for configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the device on request in the CD@@ DB register . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first must be connected to the internet . )
starts out and - when an encoder is configured in the code tab at the setup tab - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the option can be read with another encoder as the standard . it is to be noted that before the Encoder has been configured in the tab setting settings .
open the file manager , so that an already selected file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and add .
opens the alignment dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
open the main setup dialog of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ ily ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as encoder , for setup of the encoding ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes ton@@ ic quality , co@@ effici@@ ents and compression rates , and helps you to choose the proper body .
if no audio information is supposed to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , possibly available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ aries are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues
+ High until very high sound quality ( at high level rates ) , but compared with OGG easily deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play devices exists .
MP3 - if music can be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special Auto @-@ stereo . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices are mostly supporting the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to the audio quality and of the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ ug for music by young people , portable devices and auto@@ die @-@ plants . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that entered manually or run by the program automatically from Free@@ D@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used to create file size and file names and the code of file names and the properties of the music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ aries , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ aries and these parameters here . the manual or help to the co@@ di@@ ers declare the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) add to MP@@ 3@@ s with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameters of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ thing ; added . the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ thing ; parameters which can be used ( = button of a button in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , where people can download the audio CDs into the machine , so that all the other information can be downloaded from itself into the machine . it is to be noted that here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ tus : that &apos;s the author ) is not attor@@ ney . however , nobody can prevent from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so you can neither do nor any artist nor the music company harm . any information can be obtained from a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ ily , it is active a check box . in this type of configuration , it seems to be used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used in the server ( this can only know the programm@@ ers that has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ ily is set up ; intended for use of Free@@ D@@ b , the geographical nearest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of refle@@ ctions for online delivery of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates on the database .
what kind of reading is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that to use cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to be more precise , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
to store the ex@@ chang@@ able WAV files , the code can be selected and thus the desired file format is selected . during the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for the setup of the code . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab .
the co@@ di@@ ers package must be installed by the running lin@@ ux distribution before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ke , further information on its switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . there must be &apos; lame &apos; by the name of the installed Ko@@ dian .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read @-@ on of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) , please try to enter both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might be something wrong .
check if you are not a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; you want to read . check the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give it tips how to go ahead .
did you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow do not always understand what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , setting everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use &apos; lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 fl@@ yers ( tags ) .
it must be installed cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame on your computer . both programs should be available as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software for example . in any case , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to have it ( eg ; by copy to copy a copy ) .
the first section is the basic setup of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ thing , something that probably will be done only once and
the second section describes the presentation of a &amp; CD ; to be repeated for every purpose &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the co@@ di@@ ers used to compression the music ( lame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet download .
although we can change this settings at any time , we probably do not change with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is delivered to the readers program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your run . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is possible , you can also find a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card of the card details . here is not much to do . here , an additional transformation is defined . in our example , everything will be displayed / entered as shown in screen photo .
just ask for un@@ complete information , so you will be informed if data are missing to the record of keywords ( tags ) .
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and can download the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b computer .
note : calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet to access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found , once you are un@@ happy with the database name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed with conv@@ ex file name and file names and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter all the box and Free@@ D@@ b is not used . however , this is about 620 MB large , you must be selected to use it twice . in order to select Free@@ D@@ b in off @-@ mode mode , you must be selected at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cardboard card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data inquiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ D@@ b @-@ Server via the Internet . how does the system know what data can get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ D@@ b . put everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we just want to work on the Internet server only .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and check it out after a mirror server in your area . on this path , the load between the machines is distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , but as many Fire@@ walls uses the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf in the internet .
in this example , we do not want &amp; CD ; transmit data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be dis@@ able .
simply take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure that the file / tmp is available on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same drive with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this on the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you can specify this file , then the file / file can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored . if the box is not crossed , the files will not be crossed in private folders . do not forget this folder if you want to make a bit with the WAV files .
everything you enter as it is on screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances , something must be sto@@ cked out to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
the number of WAV files at the same time : when a dual @-@ core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ thing ; ends . this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the file structure is described and set up . first , a connection to the internet is organized , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ D@@ b will pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each purpose &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD ; the screen photos are not contained in Free@@ D@@ b , see the screen photos a little different than the one &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter instead of taking them from the internet . comments are to be found on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD now must be inserted into the drive which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD can be picked up successfully by Free@@ D@@ b , all tracks are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; you will select a window , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits perfectly .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic qu@@ ery of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) you can also solve this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , you need to get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; top@@ ical title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the &apos; top@@ ical title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ quities per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which are valid for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ D@@ b , the CD editor is not blank , but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor , so that you do not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ ired comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , this option is set up at the tab at the tab . throw a look at the section &apos; basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ zer to obtain more information .
simply select one entry , obviously with the style of the permitted CD ; this example is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the listed data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information that you wish .
Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
note that it has a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected on the line . a simple click on the line switches the selection of each piece or select the button All pieces select the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
when clicking on the button selecting the reading process , this window appears on confirmation . OK , and then we &apos;ll see a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
Click on the riders orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you are trying to work with a code which you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the client list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in an example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the reading of the first piece .
assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is improved now .
the author of the program has no configuration settings found to read this behavior . the only one thing seems to be configur@@ able is the result of parallel . the used machine with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded and a third order in the qu@@ eue at the qu@@ eue . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ ily ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ fer ; today , you can download an anonymous copy as part of the co@@ sting media package . however , you can download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions , however , can already be an exempl@@ ary copy of your distribution . if you read this package you have already done this package from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is directed to persons that comp@@ ile the source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help with the program your needs can be adjusted once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls out many different programs , has many variations on settings . at the best you can read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
Hi , always read on ? even if only the help menu after the first @-@ time frame of the program was cli@@ cked , without any reference point as it is to pass from this somehow empty screen from ( especially if there is no audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ?
why is it ? who reads this , probably started the program already . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t keep this manual . it is as the first version for a manual and audi@@ o@@ thing . if you also want to add something useful or change , let it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has understood this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange if it has managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ ace of &amp; K@@ DE . in addition to others he did not have a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ time presentation of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ support will work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project drivers , which is used for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as there is a Sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of each MIDI channel ( virtual ) keyboard by typ@@ ing the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can draw in &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI file from a &amp; constellation ; windows to K@@ mid can be moved .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the process .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE , while playing a song , kick off the next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... select from the menu file . it appears to be the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; constellation ; windows to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows may drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and install the button in the tool bar , select the entry pick @-@ up from the menu or run the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play one another . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any site by using the middle mouse button and drive away with the regulator and drive .
if you find that a song becomes too fast or to slow down , you can change to the arrows at the left and to the right of the template . to get the speed speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry pause in the menu , interrup@@ ts the playback . plug@@ ging the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are expected and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you have to adjust nothing manually . if so , in the menu settings , you will need to adjust nothing manually , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries text events or property events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are the series to be played after . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to place a collection , first open the collection manager . this is located in the menu collection under the point . Click here on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then add the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set up the desired format option .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns it if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by adding a song . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the automation automation collection .
if automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection ( using File , or drag &amp; Drop ) .
when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removal .
you can select the order in which songs are played off . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be set .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , record next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
in order to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the delete collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection cannot be extingu@@ ished . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not stored on leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favourite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece .
each section can only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . the requirement for this is , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
they see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map @-@ file as an email , so that I in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you must not change the order and no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now an MIDI @-@ file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fl@@ ation ) it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Tro@@ uble patch of the patch is meant when each tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone the pitch of the same drum means ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how sounds are depicted on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
like in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you must only use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to cover sounds onto the Per@@ c@@ tee channel . check out as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , make it simply in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the pattern :
n is the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the corresponding Key@@ map is to be used again in front of the file ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the Per@@ c@@ tee patch on the Per@@ c@@ tee channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio will be multiplied , in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to have no dec@@ imal place in the Map @-@ file .
this setting is needed , because GM suggest that there is a keyboard that is supposed to be a pitch benchmark with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some keyboards up to one oc@@ tave higher . in order to find the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI settings dialog . this can be found in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole number of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ vi@@ atures , you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a instrument , the button doesn &apos;t appear green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the can@@ al@@ view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view the Settings menu below the point of can@@ al@@ view : settings
the temp@@ o LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD .
an MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so it can result in two different devices at very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes on a very different way .
well , I can force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . in an MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you compiled a binding ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; it has happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you have to download and install a source code ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files separately .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; de@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , you can absolutely automatically activate the collection automation collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can double the arrow keys from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o , click on the LCD double .
I have on one &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; Connectivity ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this Desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or I want to play a file , merely go to the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; Windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen quickly a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automation automation to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you want to play the first file . so , set the setting automation to the collection and open A.@@ C. Your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then join us , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do it ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all many thanks ! if I listen to these songs or postcard , anim@@ ate me that , continue to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my Hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions prove .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge anticip@@ ation if you send me a postcard from your residence or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or an MIDI file , then I will record a MIDI file , but you should contact me when I &apos;ve got the file .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality is essential from your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you &apos;ll need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can not hear music .
if difficulties pers@@ ist , please contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD or TV and camera .

for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User mailing list .
the application window is created from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is in it .
it is possible to add the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you would like to create a list of entries you should be played after each other , so you should use the Category long play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archy . if you are looking for an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the requested entry .
the categories &apos; News &apos; , TV and continuous play@@ list can also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files . of course you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player , but also through the application itself . just click on a name of a category click on the menu view and next edit mode . by clicking with a sub@@ group , the XML content is displayed in this section .
after changing XML files , you must select from the menu with play@@ list and select either the processing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost , when working mode or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when cutting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; kiss player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml will be aware of this format .
the animation does not need to be short , it is automatically completed by opening another source . however , this would be dis@@ rup@@ ted by the end of the animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; indirectly ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ ; &amp; lt ; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported in the tests / several examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this r@@ end@@ ition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played by the special field of Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
in order to use the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in setup dialog file assign@@ ments of K@@ DE will be specified .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consol@@ es application and to search error messages concerning the store of brows@@ ers module library . if there are no mistakes , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order to always be taken a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined also ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner can be configured to use and the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) , the dialog can be found in settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be found to be found ( for example , it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DVB .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably the only one works ) should also work on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . )

are there hints as I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as user root after mounting the device . it is absolutely certain to make that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine just starts slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked on their performance ?

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used on the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux . distribution list . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the c@@ ile ; - Website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions concerning documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or the documentation should be desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; - website .
if you have any questions or if you want to comp@@ ile or are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the ability to complete , comp@@ ile and tail@@ or @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the ability to complete , comp@@ ile , editing and trou@@ bles@@ hooting are required . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities was to learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can work directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate &apos;s chapter .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the correct language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H . it is difficult to use , also a La@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros use . a less demanding but more realistic setting is that it desc@@ ends from the last name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
there is not only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book . to allow &amp; lat@@ ex ; a guide to &amp; lat@@ ex , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ wned .
just like other drawing languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction , with which the gener@@ al@@ ous properties such as paper format , side control and text box should be fixed with the command \ \ &apos; class , the kitchen begins with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a large function for rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . selecting the assistant ( menu ) offers some possibility to create a document . it can also be made some of the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : this will replace the type of document documentation : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , Articles &#91; letter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , page ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom defined .
coding : this is set the character encoding . it should be used to use the coding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . it should be defined as UTF @-@ 8x ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used pack@@ ets for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they have only to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used for creating German text .
new users are now not worried anymore . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is possible that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is possible by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by the time of getting time and saves time .
with the automatic closing of the environments , a new command ( e.g. \ \ manually { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for inser@@ tion of the text ) and the da@@ in@@ ous line to close the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in volume settings ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ strate element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on each other .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ many @-@ dependent File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer at the appropriate row in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; -@@ file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the package look , the elements of the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked on an element in DVI ; -@@ file @-@ click is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked on a section in DVI ; -@@ viewer is spec@@ kled .
Master document : this function is used for work with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
file security : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file is connected to the output of the complex and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after high @-@ speed .
in consideration of the editing tool bar , the three large selection of selection sectors should be developed into the document . the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The simplified &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the division are :
the selection field is further for inser@@ tion of articles such as keywords , fu@@ sions , notes , or references .
designation : with this command , a name for one section , an image or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection field ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; this only works if the file is needed to create a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand written .
the final selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the creation of the font . it can be defined as scrip@@ ted instructions for the main text , the joints , etc .
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and legend of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by the bottom of the hand .
the bra@@ ckets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font color . it is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the volume building or the button of the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; storing the storage automatically .
if the compilation of the document should be searched for the errors . when using quick construction should &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
an environment ( engl@@ ish@@ . environment ) is a text which is different from the other document . for example , a report with the font size should have been created . the command \ \ reference { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } encour@@ ages the possibility of written down within the area of the area of the &quot; Out@@ side Hu@@ ge &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
in the area only within the environment ( from \ \ to { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) , there is no limitations ( number ) for the changes within a environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fatty printing , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either added to the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ The { emp@@ h } : this command is available for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as it is closed , until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; { qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; evaluation language is displayed , then follows a step @-@ to @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the wi@@ z@@ ard a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . for example , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in fat and short printing and a poem to the application are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be turned into the editor by editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E ( at the internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to one &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a non @-@ dependent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ .2 ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for reading of some drivers on the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screen .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after the click on DVI - you can then print the document using file printing ( in the viewer , if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar conversion the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin to change other formats using the button P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary search encour@@ ages direct jump from the editor to the two @-@ door position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . only Modern under settings can be set up ... tools to be used .
to select the preliminary search , the mouse indicator has to be positioned in a line of source tex@@ tu@@ bing and close to preliminary search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is so@@ aked .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , one click on the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; used and related to the corresponding line . to this one must be specified as text editor ( Settings ... Editor )
if using quick @-@ structure of the &amp; DVI ; the viewer can not be used , a mistake may lie . if an error occurs , this will appear in the log file or in the news window .
the log@@ ging file is the source of error in the source code . the log@@ ging file always gives the line to the error in which the error appears . to look at the wrong column , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging , navigating immediately to the err@@ one@@ ous line .
once you cli@@ cked on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the presentation template for the document . the pre @-@ provided toll are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can be written either of the reason or the assistant to create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates are made in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new model , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file to create or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file template file ... create .
in creating a new document using a file , new character strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... settings General .
in creating the own template , it is necessary to know which character strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ PT@@ I@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by the input in document class . typically it is used as such as : \ \ Cl@@ ose &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ PT@@ I@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to creating a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard and that is associated with the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document , its own template may be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers of reading and her@@ e@@ jection of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be done directly in the menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his enthusiasm should learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; go directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate &apos;s work .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command re@@ ference , which can be called for the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you will reveal an evaluation description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with press C@@ tr@@ l key to run the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , in the click \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ \ par .
when pulling the text with dr@@ illed lin@@ ker mouse , the selected text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , you can fully select parts of the source code in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; the possibility to bro@@ wse the wide variety of source texts and emphas@@ ize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants invites you to create an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu brand or the corresponding key stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that this jumps is also highlighted in the first input of a character automatically .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code for their selection . under editing the following commands are contained to the text of the text :
when a complete paragraph consists of ( group of lines that contained on both sides an empty row ) . this extended meaning is not given to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only prevent@@ ative thing in &amp; k@@ ile , is that the shut@@ down are separated by two empty lines .
when the word is below the current Cur@@ sor@@ ter , this selection has also an extended meaning , since this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a separate star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to make a part of a part of the document , this first can be removed and removed by pressing the key . &amp; Kate ; offers its own commands here . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands for a faster user . under editing , the following commands are contained in the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a section in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing descriptions .
it was already clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under operating environment for one m@@ ely simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , the current environment is spec@@ kled ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ of { surroundings } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of shi@@ fted environment commands it can quickly be lost . this command close the last modified environment , so that the scra@@ p structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Be@@ en Te@@ X Group are a few important commands , which correspond to those working environment .
with this command , the current group starts ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the closed cl@@ amp .
with this command , the current group runs ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closed cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the so@@ aked cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is spec@@ kled ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many welded groups bra@@ ckets you can perish quickly . this command close the last modified group , so that the scra@@ p structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not dist@@ orted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple follow @-@ up characters are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character is used for two simple suits . also for the end of the arrivals the character is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and apply two sleeping spaces for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic installation of double contact code can be set up under the att@@ itudes K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and out .
it can also be used as specific settings ( e.g. n@@ t or French ) and to be used for German or French investors . there are also many other languages available .
when entering the shift , cap@@ itali@@ ze &amp; c@@ ile ; a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. , enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , is available , not only a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close in a tables or environment ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ with a close line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ score pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added below settings ; take up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users are able to arrange the columns in tables and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . if this tab@@ ulator is not to be encouraged in the dar@@ ing line . although this tab@@ ulator is not being added , it is added to the column position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate is already a good source code , it was added in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to include special commands ( usually available for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) three to need and the other two are available for different working settings . all these modes are set for different working settings .
when you start a new environment with the command \ \ of { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty row ( for the text ) .
when pressing the selection , the last character of the input will be removed and completely de@@ emed by the ful@@ fill@@ ment list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be submitted to the selection of a command . alternatively , jump to these positions , so that simply jump to these positions by editing the bl@@ acks of spr@@ inting stamp , and the mixed parameters will then be frozen .
among settings are able to set up ... k@@ ile ; ful@@ fil@@ able settings to these lists are made . they may be able to choose different ways of bet@@ s for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ abs of the general language used .
the command mode is to be entered for the completion of environments . on the other hand , the environments will always be entered into a few letters with \ \ . on the other hand , environments become so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of environments is used .
when calling for the completion mode , the order entry is automatically sorted and it appears \ \ of { s ) . after that , the ambient sound will continue in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and will be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way through the input of input .
after this is completed , the environment will be closed once again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is available .
among settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; ful@@ fil@@ able settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the list of ful@@ fill@@ ment mode for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ scores custom @-@ defined lists of ab@@ rupt strings , which can immediately be set up immediately by clicking K@@ ile . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word of process mode is inserted , or the key code of tr@@ l + Alt space bar is introduced , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
great views are not helpful for the automatic delay . however , it has been noted that many whales are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion of all is already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile ful@@ fill@@ ment . here , the swelling can also be set for display of completion .
the ful@@ fill@@ ment files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / / / mode / or the Persian @-@ home folder . mode is available for use ( return ) , ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to make graphics as simple as possible . for example , the basics of the basics should be considered as graphical .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is fully arranged , then the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are newly arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to improve the result of work , the source must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu of Cre@@ ate , creating and summar@@ ize the creation .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewer as &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used with Alt ; 3 times , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file is converted and using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command quick construction , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ ile . if no embedded viewer should be used , every time a new window will be .
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... Hier@@ in will be asked for the project information :
when using the fil@@ en@@ ames window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ MAS@@ cript code . the scripts are managed in the vertical glue .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even further .
first of all , the scripts environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite unusual system to be expanded in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to under@@ wear the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; texts ; are delivered with many documents . there are a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
there is not only one description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands contain and is thus ideal for the search for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very rough document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three key book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / texts will be delivered , the Find of the right document is not always easy . as a single help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all of &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied by documents and hier@@ archy .
all documents are sub@@ divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for par@@ et@@ names or r@@ ammer . from &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space of space bar the viewer for the document .

everyone who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has said that this is how it &apos;s still a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer depend on the terminal ; simply click on the XML processor and finished !
this application expects an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be attached to the current working folder . if not , then remove the current working folder and give them in the field of other folders to the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted each time when I have started .
as already said , everyone who worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ um lus , there is now a great graphic interface .
if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply select the current working folder . if not , they then select current folders , and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a copy on the screen , your file is in@@ correct . please check the reported error and try it again .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative system ; Even if the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . this allows you to benefit from the additional functionality , and must not wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; quant@@ um system ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used further down .
to install a plug @-@ in or any part , we start the plug @-@ in menu with the menu plug@@ ins . in this way , the following dialog will be opened :
this dialogue allows all plug@@ ins to manage and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place is used &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; this path to searching the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quant@@ um ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties @-@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the name of the user and serves to identify clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team manager and Sub@@ project Manager .
the user can look for itself from the list of Team Members who he is . this is done by looking for the team member of the list and expresses the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of your own identity are important for news and notes . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of their team , there is another advantage of the capture of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders if something is happening . see in further information .
event actions are promotions that are executed if something specific in the project happens . an example would be the opening of opening and closing of the project , so that later , if a file is secured , or a script that will play a file into CVS as soon as they will be added to the project , etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the mailing lists in the receiver list . the address satellite can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such conduc@@ tors .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note to your comments is simple . it can either be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary area followed by calling ext .
notes can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where the name of the newly appointed nick@@ name of the team member is a role in the project from the following ways : team leader Head Project Manager , According to the transfer and sub@@ project leaders , as in the following examples below .
top names and roles names are independent of large or small , but spaces around bra@@ ckets and note : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ um lus ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ no@@ stic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; quantitative lus ; specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends across some sites that will be treated with one another .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car weight , can be changed . the entries are :
large / small description of tags : large / small @-@ description of automatic tags . normal large / small @-@ case means , the tags are added as added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small @-@ description of attributes : large / small description of automatic attributes . normal large / small @-@ case means the attributes will be added as added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if attached , is optional for tags for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
no optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update the start and final day : if switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of accent signs : controls the automatic conversion of accurate characters into the appropriate coding during the ti@@ pping .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the standard , the default results can be restored .
standard string coding : the coding of newly created or in other way as with the opening of opening files ( where the coding of the file can be transp@@ osed ) , but this setting is inserted from the same in the project properties , if a project is charged .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files that DT@@ D is not recognized by the same in the project properties , if a project is charged .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ um lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that during a blackout or crash when you start the program the document can be recovered from this f@@ use . this is not the same as save the file . even for not stored documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edit@@ or@@ area or an own view ( or documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful when changing the user interface through alter@@ ations of the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range serves for the taxes of possibility to switch the display of war@@ nings by complaints by no longer .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; change symbols instead of scripts instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source output in shared mode . in terms of different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change through the structure of the structure with the mouse buttons .
in the structural tree settings , the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically , and how deep at a change in the structure will be opened automatically . blank knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in which there are no element found in the current document .
the range for creating abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be classified for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s valid , it can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP . this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ config command will mean anything else than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
plug@@ ins are managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from the third side that can be used by any K@@ Part application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be explained :
address : the path to plug @-@ in if it is not on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file to the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the repository .
component of the &quot; Only @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to store the store if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then tested &amp; quantitative system ; if the given information is correct . if the plug @-@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the d@@ b@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quantitative ; insert .
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with the selection of a matching deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the option options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in box , the specific settings can be changed .
when a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ um system ; user interface :
a view , displayed in the content of supervised variables . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view , where all holding points are listed , with we@@ dge numbers and conditions listed . usually appears in the lower do@@ ck .
a view , shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appears in the lower do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on deb@@ ug@@ gles . this promotion is being used by default if a project is opened , that will not be respected in the normal case .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the leaves for requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to address a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . this request is displayed in the deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and the current line on the over@@ saw variables as well as the current line up . if this happens while the script is started , the execution will be resum@@ ed , the script begins with the request .
indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without information about supervised variables and the current line number . if this is done , the execution continues . if this is done , the execution date is given , the execution starting as soon as a request is provided .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , without entering into the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes included in@@ correct .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to go to the instruction and to go to the next way as if there were not the current .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or expression can be entered , the super@@ vis@@ ing value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quant@@ um lus ; custom@@ ize your needs , and how you can help &amp; quant@@ um ; help to get better .
document types Edit@@ ing packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ um ; used to make support for mark@@ up@@ - and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes up of &amp; quant@@ um trees ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files are handmade , symbolic bodies of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can insert faster into a document than a user .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be built @-@ in ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DT@@ D . see details for conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bars enable a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing as folders . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to make other users a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limits is provided in simple manner .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about itself .
the tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( Family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
valid only for the type Method . gives the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( Family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is a only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . in addition , it contains the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains further tags to describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
is the source used for filling the source used for the attributes in the tag editor and in the attribute tree .
requires resource = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires resource = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ name within &amp; quant@@ um system ; used to achieve the data source .
requires resource = d@@ co@@ p , a cut @-@ section and a method@@ ology . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % day@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of any tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in the &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; window to start and checking Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is not available yet . currently , the audit is carried out only by the store of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ um ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this day XML file is to be Schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; drawer function is described . the file name of this day XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be handled via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings ; with editing a &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = users 1 for &amp; quant@@ um ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name as nick@@ name is used .
a promotion can set up actions with settings ... created . Click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button of this promotion is defined . by clicking the User button , a button should be assigned ; with K@@ one the current ke@@ yst@@ anders can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the Det@@ a@@ ili@@ ated settings and inserted in the document the document will be inserted at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications can change or use as input ( or parts of document ) . examples of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; even are the quick start -@@ dialog or the various see ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ anta / scripts local script file : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replaces the current document &apos;s URL . in case of a local document , file will be removed : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ um system ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ um system ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script exec@@ utes can be received from &amp; quant@@ um ; at the default input . in the box input , input can be determined , which is to be send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected document of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to input , the output of the listed application can also be implemented . there are two types of issue : normal edition , written on the default issue ; error messages , on the default issue . it can be specified , which will be set to the default output by default :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create an own tool bar . in the case it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and , if the day attributes , and you plan to use their use , activate dialog &quot; Day &quot; when available , so that a input will be possible when using the action .
ignor@@ ant ! is that a domestic symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating an symbol that the promotion is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; drop menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all the other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually regarded as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should be sign@@ aled down to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; ready to insert the tag in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it must still be linked to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
choose the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue using other tags , so there are still which are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be divided to a better overview by some tr@@ denom@@ in@@ ator in several groups . open the tool@@ bars on settings tool@@ bars . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tr@@ enner ( top left ) for my tool bar . after the choice of the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by tasting of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
save in the correct file . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ pedi@@ gre@@ ed , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is open from the appropriate folder .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; for normal users the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ att@@ ing language , which you like to like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory whether someone has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create a existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second part we treat you here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top element = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 3 = day 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Sec@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = a age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents file is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ;
the table section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed as writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ fet@@ ch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ aid would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file distribution lines .
a simple list of different context @-@ related context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply store your do@@ cr@@ c file and save $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you have this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copying your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth it , please send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have been involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the remaining resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send an email to friends , partners or else to whom . in different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; quantitative users can download it . the contributions will be checked and only available for publication . in order to make a useful contribution , we recommend that there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is ensured , both for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are required according to their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have to pass one . in the dialog new resource you must remain empty ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading can be started .
the up@@ loading can also upload the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload tool@@ bar , and will begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; the authenti@@ city of the resource is warning and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears , stating the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; but it can be used simultaneously , because hundreds of day files could be necessary in day XML format . there is the easier way to convert DT@@ D to a DT@@ EP package automatically .
converting from the DT@@ D store and convert a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ d file with DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
destination name : newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition : the string that appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d should be released
fine adjustment of DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quant@@ um ; according to conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these fundamental concepts and quantitative benefits . this chapter one has to bring about these fundamental concepts to them , without their understanding and quant@@ it@@ lus ; little use would increase .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quant@@ um ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ um ; use , available in common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; saved . this allows the Group of administ@@ rators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and samples in the global tree that will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local items provide a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be done with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees inside the project .
the &amp; quantitative system ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the builders , the cart@@ ei@@ vers with information and the tool@@ bars . please turn in , and for further information regarding these areas .
you can click the flash@@ cards with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current doctrine , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click menu in the Edit@@ or@@ area lead to another context menu regarding the processed documentation ( copying / copying / paste / paste / inser@@ ting ) , editing of the mouse po@@ inter , or opening the file below the mouse po@@ inter , or opening the file below the mouse po@@ inter to a file .
at the upper end of the Edit@@ ors are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; quant@@ um ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional is shown as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ um ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really light . if they want to insert a simple day , for example , &amp; lt ; then click on the symbol that the day represents , then you can insert the data for this just one day . if they want to insert several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the supervision of construction ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; to navigate them to open and cross @-@ strips . in the presentation of flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample positions , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building devices .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ um tool ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project using correct mouse click . actions like adding , removing , upload or delete files from the storage media can be performed with the console menu .
another option of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , all web site &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be sub@@ divided into three categories , depending on what connection it is used . the category depends on &amp; quant@@ um ; the working range are always available , local templates are only usable for the appropriate users and templates in projects only in the project . more to templates are found .
here you can find information about the available scripts in the Global , Local and Project here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , further functions can start to edit , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links to one element , the cur@@ sor is set on the position of the element . by right @-@ click of a element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and ref@@ us@@ al of the tree is opened .
this tree appears among other devices . with it can change sorting and nam@@ esp@@ aces , which allows you to change the content of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it can be downloaded from quantitative documentation for &amp; quant@@ um ; it can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc into a project can create project @-@ specific documentation , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; two cart@@ ei@@ on@@ ites at the lower end of the window can be reached via the usable information : the news window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes on DT@@ D are displayed .
this cart@@ on shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ um tool ; tool@@ bars are extensively developed and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate making of the tool@@ bars is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ um ; to define .
another function of &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; is the ability to send an tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; quant@@ um ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; quant@@ um ; how to secure and load any other !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ files on your system . for this , Auto@@ conf might get a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with the st@@ ems of &amp; quant@@ um ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is located in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quantitative lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative complex ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editing the developers of &amp; quant@@ um ; what would be when &amp; quant@@ um ; a stand@@ alone , ext@@ end@@ able mark@@ up language editor would like ? well , this would make it an absolutely fantastic web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE . so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then the appropriate &amp; IDE ; for that , the appropriate &amp; IDE .
now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; quant@@ um ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; the company is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; it is not only possible to expand this , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; to extend how they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative monitors ; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can enhance productivity almost every task . by the program Kom@@ i , they can expand &amp; quant@@ um ; without any scrip@@ ting scrip@@ ting @-@ language support must be noted . ( more about it in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for rapid development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L cen@@ sored version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of this documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; de@@ quer@@ or ; enter or in@@ help@@ centre help : / qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta has been developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time if you open a file , which is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and entire files as templates for the later use . check in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project pre @-@ level file , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there included special characters to &amp; HTML , preventing them correctly and not be understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing assignment .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ app@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day uses .
switch the block selection to or out . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key ; please select .
go straight to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are available !
searching for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not on . that &apos;s the window , in which you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
spin and Swit@@ ching of the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ um system ; the problem journalist is activated once you move to the structural tree .
displays the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to set the Bookmark with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will be previous in the menu together with entries or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sors in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quantitative complex ; -@@ projects are saved with file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that enables to copy graphics files into your project folder , or a sub @-@ folder and then add it to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded any additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quantitative lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ projects you can find details .
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project management / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it creates only the name . actions must be saved by settings actions . tool@@ bars will be saved via tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the visible area . this del@@ etes it not from the hard drive . if you don &apos;t have saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
thus , you can send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ team , so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu option opens up a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where any other can access them . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or any other made and convert them to the &amp; quant@@ um system ; own PA format .
charging / stimul@@ ants from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is sensible if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP is to renew without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP . if this is global and write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog , when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific accommodation .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quantitative inser@@ ts ; the inser@@ tion by tool bar is ref@@ using if this day is contradic@@ ted to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the top of the menu points . please click . click on a activated plug @-@ in disabled .
select the current file value for the current file . the list of available her@@ ni@@ zation schem@@ ata depends on the same ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external use tidy .
immediate change between different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can cause or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the bottom line mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu for each open under@@ window contains one entry . with a selection of entry , the appropriate lower window is activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ um ; main f@@ enst@@ ers .
the changes in this dialog can be used in any application that use the HTML @-@ part , including the &amp; counter web browser .
jud@@ ging the behavior of editing a . in documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find detailed information .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , add which you can change and follow the sequences .
this should create a help in the environment &apos;s environment , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free to use , but as with every open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , for example , after filling the project name , all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ th@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine to which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you use this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocols are used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you can download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you need to proceed differently .
note , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will not be involved . if a project is started ane@@ w , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to vou@@ chers .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or by removing the skins , out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wi@@ z@@ ard contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu profile , or upload with the button Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) to re @-@ read for projects such as project folders .
suppl@@ ementary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can read more about project views .
with this , the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently , G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be set in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in this , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described .
in the bottom @-@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the advertisement for the content of the server for each profile by showing a separate building services for each profile .
in the lower window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the lower window configuration , one can change event actions and add these actions , change or delete the actions . event transactions are executed if a certain event occurs , such as the sick@@ nesses of a file . see details .
by default &amp; quant@@ um lus opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior can currently not affect .
to open a different project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ um lus is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative files are changed . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open to open ... in the context of the right mouse @-@ up menu menu :
various profiles can be chosen here . the profile contains information about the place of high @-@ allow@@ able files . see .
allows for removing the current profile . if there is only one profile there , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing removing .
the password is reserved in the core memory and forget about programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password stored on the disk option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; many high @-@ load profiles have been created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creation of a profile , this dialog will display :
this is the name of the server that will be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS can choose .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not to the usual port .
depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . if your password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read on the plate , but everyone with programming language can be easily seen in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simply exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the project or the project tool bar , available via settings tool@@ bars project tool bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ um lus , with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ um ; to your own work@@ ings .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; best through the menu tool@@ bars can be st@@ ack@@ able . use and add . adding tool bars will be treated below in the section of adding tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set to adjust either via context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a New tool@@ bar can be executed , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool bar , in addition the entries must remove and processed action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .
templates are in essential document@@ aries , code sni@@ ps and files to link . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any existing file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move one or any of the existing directory in the pre @-@ level file . templates have in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you can set up for the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their applications . please read the conditions before using any template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents by lin@@ king ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the pre @-@ level file under global templates .
documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ level file under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a presentation but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final score to a complete menu system based on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the pre @-@ level file under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
as the name says , these templates are serving as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there is no examples in &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; .
design a document structure to popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and save file as a template as a local template ....
once this is done , notice that ( even if it has been saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the Project tree . look at the pre @-@ tree in the project .
select text in your document and click on file as a template to store selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged along with pulling and arrange on the building view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a pre @-@ file folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and insert or inser@@ ting on the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can choose a folder in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , the project folder is secured , but of course it can be saved as local or global presentation .
project plans permit a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link with them . in addition , you can retain some things using templates in projects very profound in mind .
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / editing / apps / qu@@ anta / editing / apps / qu@@ anta / editing / apps / qu@@ anta / editing templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as stated above .
to determine the behavior of a folder is in the level of file , click on the folder and select the context menu properties below . the following dialog appears :
a radio box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led , as soon as el@@ ter@@ al attributes is disgu@@ ised .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except for the stem @-@ folders . if a stem @-@ folder would be dis@@ able , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of normal folder , the B@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ builders . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder .
allow you to set previous or set text for templates in this folder . this might be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
in addition , you will feature context menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative system ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which are available via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source editor through the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second divi@@ des the editing window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and when needed to edit the source code Editor , in which the changes in the V@@ PL file format are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor at a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ours .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that , at the same time , the cur@@ sor in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor synchron@@ ously runs . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , this mode is already active in the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , whereby the position is kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . if you choose from synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is set to be adjusted . basically applies the recommendation : a small pot for fast computers and a great span for slow PC .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose the title of un@@ visible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created . this allows you to change the h@@ ash of h@@ ash .
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document themselves , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list enables the change of the content , such as key words on the column names and keyword sub@@ stit@@ uted 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the list below the list or delete . a change on the list is possible as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS style by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor use is as usual in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the mark works as usual . text can be inserted through single tap and deleted by back@@ sliding or distances .
the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor , is done . it is to be noted that the inser@@ ts of tags are not removed earlier , e.g. an anchor @-@ day , comp@@ assed with text , every other one @-@ to @-@ date must be removed .
some tool@@ bars as the tables assistant or the lists are disabled . you will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used for tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; a tool for analysis of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements can be followed , and the design of style can be tra@@ cked .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had corrected many changes and corrected the submission to many places . another programm@@ ers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts with mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ es to the places where perhaps only the objec@@ tion had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences in one line and modifications to white signs . later , many further useful features have been added .
if you would like to compare the text quickly , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ known file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two people can work independently of one piece of co@@ de and make modifications at the same time . in this editor you can even edit the outcome . in this editor , you can even edit the results directly . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files when merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you get the same and merge folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with folders :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the precise differences and adap@@ ts to the possibilities of current color monitors . if you need to check code often , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the column in the column at the left side . ( no anger more if any one changes the return . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates that the file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the Ti@@ pp@@ work by scanning the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
diff@@ use folder and diff@@ use folder in diff@@ use folder , diff@@ use folder in diff@@ use folder , diff@@ use folder in diff@@ use folder , diff@@ use folder in diff@@ use folder
the opening dialog allows manual setting of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the list . the opening dialog will give you a third file again . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be done .
above the button ... you can also select one folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ ing or merge file will be introduced , for B and C , however , use a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging crosses , the input field is active for the target and process it . however , it is not necessarily required to determine immediately an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the setup button gives a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text compare . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to pull text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison of opening dialog must not select any files , you can easily connect the dialog using the button .
you can also use pulling and use : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from a editor and let it fall on a compar@@ ative window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file for e.g. several similar functions . if you need to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to upload and compare it into &amp; diff@@ 3 ; and now you can simply copy the relevant sections and then compare it .
note : at the moment , you can &apos;t pull out anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the changes of text into a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some Edit@@ ors interpre@@ t the goat and insert text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source code contains the character A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that windows C is optional ) . ( if the path has to rest for a bit , let the mouse will rest for a while above the line . then a small aux@@ iliary window will display the full name . )
the three source code contains the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one can see on the color which file differs . if both files are distinguished , the default color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good .
left alongside the text is the merge column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comm@@ ent@@ aries , for the processor and in a few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column of the text , is interrupted by the digits , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison list ) also has a information line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic mer@@ ging already text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next dissolved / un@@ rest conflict to find out the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , any difference is also to be solved manually at the same time .
through one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows selected , the first line of group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this group will also be displayed at the beginning of the group ) . this group will then be emphas@@ ized with the color background colour for current area and on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes , through the automatic mer@@ ging or manual mode , no further line remains in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you might change your opinion , and maybe select another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er that you may copy and insert it differently .
the text &amp; lt ; matching conversion flow ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if you select the sources the options ignore or use Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs .
this will navigate mainly with the image processing and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys to the right , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . you can also click here to navigate .
in the eye @-@ window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and transfer mode . ( default is the insert mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button to synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already stated in the section and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture back@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture downhill ) or to the next / former conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture downhill ) or to the next / former conflict . therefore , it must be regarded as a conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflict must be distinguished .
to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this option is enabled , automatically copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and copy copying copying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ ing are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ in @-@ feed \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line of the source files \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not using binary files .
the options and the list of the last used files will be stored automatically and restored to the next start . ( menu entry equipment - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a type@@ face with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides a variable width of variable width , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ic writing . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this presentation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems the button settings are automatically an odd color .
if this option is activated , when pressing the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you enter or return , the reset line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , each selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the way to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select what Z@@ eil@@ ing type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system .
while compar@@ ing files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all complete identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . also , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a vehicle @-@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , others again save a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ eck &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; however , if this option is activated , but then you could be disabled with different sizes . during the mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) igno@@ res . in the outcome , the differences are still displayed , but they will be treated like white signs .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in automatic mode @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next ung@@ el@@ dest conflict will continue .
dis@@ solves auto all conflicts in white signs by the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That is useful if white signs are less important in many files . if you have this only from time to time , use conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and mer@@ ging a mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . this option does not affect the current running program . you need to finish and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option , the default setting is used for all entries .
over the selection areas for the coding , a short notice appears what is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influenced how special characters can be treated and interpreted . as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which code should be used for storing .
if you define pre@@ fabri@@ cation commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files might handle 16 bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can define the coding of the edition of pre @-@ fabri@@ cation commands .
turn this off in order to supp@@ ress her@@ ed@@ ations of changes in text or visions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a colour @-@ coded survival column are indicated . according to selecting from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; C ; C or B &amp; lt ; C ; C is displayed next to the normal additional trans@@ itional column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . just feel the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the same window by side or over@@ lap . this may also be useful for display of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together , then if you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and use the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will first be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out parts or to correct use .
when reading a file it is given to the external command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is given ( see above ) , then the command of command is used only when the line is used . you can write your own pre@@ processor that fits your own processor . each input line needs to have an appropriate issue line .
the idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , there is an external program needed , and most users want to program it . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command to convert the input into major letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s found in the found text in upper case letters .
CVS / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ fabri@@ cation command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ . sed &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character set between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each showing will be replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform some impressions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the translations between each other . example :
instead , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are different from per@@ l some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to normal pre@@ processor will maintain for display and mer@@ ging . further operations simply change the data that sees the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ processor will see the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . from this reason , you can compare and assemble complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes , without it really perform ,
... lead selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you need to open only folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders can be merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target file specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the mer@@ ging . to select the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
during the in@@ reading of the folder you can inform a little news window about current progress . if you start scanning the file , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folder was found during scan , displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can click on the + / - click , or to double the arrow keys for the left / right . the menu @-@ menu contains two functions , fl@@ aps and collect all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
if you click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these guys are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action is not automatically selected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black are used .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical when its total content is identical . then also folder the same color . when folders is the age un@@ equal to its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. , if A folder and B one file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such err@@ one@@ ous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( such as A folder and B one file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such err@@ one@@ ous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ise is active when only two folder and no explic@@ it target file specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then cho@@ oses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary promotion will be identical to the file . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : mer@@ ging and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be combined and the option of new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. sol@@ es such mistakes can not be eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folder may not be started .
during the mer@@ ging you will have a file after the other . it status column displays Fer@@ tig , if the merge is successful , and according to other messages , if something is expected , you should make a final review and see if the status is fine everywhere .
when in alignment dialog , the file compar@@ ative method is chosen , K@@ Diff@@ 3 further columns indicate . these contain the number of un@@ conscious , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can select either the selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you don &apos;t have any target file , then in the three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode C , B is used as the target , when the two @-@ file merge is selected and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a target file , please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target file , even in the folder structure . there are some options to ski@@ pped the specific entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to bring together all entries : select Directory Settings / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the Tast@@ ing button ) to put together only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exists invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the err@@ one@@ ous elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you put together all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , sim@@ ulating and break out .
choose sim@@ ulating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a full list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge to a single file ) , then a merge window ( see screen photo ) .
if you are finished with a file , select another directory to start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next post continues .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on one error , there &apos;s a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you may want to try to ski@@ p the problem of any problem . if you choose to choose the problem , or make the problem to resolve the problem or solve the problem in any way before you proceed with the mer@@ ging .
if some entries were individually operated , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and lead them together at the later session . even if the merge is over@@ loaded , these entries are considered active . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree . there can be several patterns . put the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . folders must not comply with this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be entered in elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be entered in elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that are also ignored by CVS . many autonomous files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files are selected attribute . in other file systems you have marked a previous point . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on the default .
in case of links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic lin@@ s are compared . if the option is switched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal files will be treated and recur@@ sive . ( note that a link to a folder should lead to a final shift , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file by and shows statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ equal , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( specify an appropriate Anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folder on a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only changing the date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is activated in default .
similar to the date of change , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when copying the date of date . please use caution . please use caution . this option is available in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target file specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are identical . also the results of merge files are stored in both folder . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of merge the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this will be considered uns@@ afe , because it is believed that the other file has not been changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is checked in default .
if a file or a folder is replaced or deleted , the original version is renamed , and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file is already deleted , this will also be deleted without additional backup . this also applies to normal merge individual files , not only the mer@@ ging whole folder . this option is switched on the default settings .
normally , the folders merge list is visible to the mer@@ ging single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the / text window between the two views .
probably , you prefer to compare a file simply using double @-@ click . yet , in the directory menu , you can also use a single file directly , without only the folder command to run . as soon as you save the result , the status will be dealt with and the file will not run once again when you run the folder .
this status is however lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . that is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated if a link indicates a file or folder . then it will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change of change from the original . ( note the option of trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as the differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start the built @-@ in differences . in order to launch K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a piece , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch begins to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . also , please note that this does not work if no of the original files exists . also , this is un@@ reliable when the original files has changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the compar@@ isons of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ ist ) exist already . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 out of the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot , I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone this way or let him go .
you have compiled the program from sources compiled and the configure script probably not the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE can not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . you can find more information about this topic in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are identical as the same ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be identical as not identical . i@@ F similar lines from next to Each other , this P@@ is , but this is often the case .
the editor sign up for any difference in the files where he starts and where he is ending . however , this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply saved as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design an extra file format which could store this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text does not extingu@@ ish . what does this and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already used many colors to raise under@@ taking . even more her@@ e@@ dence would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .

cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switch @-@ switch ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switch @-@ switch ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all files are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore does not appear in the target folder .
( in the current program version you will need to re @-@ read these options on these options with the Update function . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are indicated that identical files will not already be copied into the target folder . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior is likely to change in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group . if the lines are already available , they will be removed from the button on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ slide in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ atures of all virtual workplace . it is quite practical to view the current programs on the working areas to change their size , to end or move it . it works both within a desktop as well as with several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas , as well as those in the current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop .
with the middle mouse button , windows within &amp; p@@ ager can be moved . the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty hole of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked on , the context menu and the name of application as well as entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , in desktop and end . the commands effect the following commands :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of mind . it appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . it appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the medium mouse button on the desktop and other working areas .
when this field is crossed , will appear in the &amp; K@@ p@@ camp ; the names of virtual workplace are displayed .
cross this field makes the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . view the numbers of virtual work areas . it is crossed along with name , the names are provided with ordained figures , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work@@ areas are displayed in order to enable their selection .
here &apos;s the view of the program window . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program layout . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main windows are determined : traditionally known as P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal , shows all virtual work areas in a horizontal and vertical range , which is very good for displaying the side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their contents . moreover he runs out of the control bar .

&amp; mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly expanding to new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; k@@ mag ; appears , a window as shown above . the enlarged section of the screen . in the following window , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window , is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a select window .
in the standard settings enlar@@ ges &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around mouse po@@ ds like a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can visu@@ alize a selected screen area in the screen window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse pointing screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , please note , the &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointing . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter .
in select mode mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrows and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse po@@ inter to the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can shift the contents of the magni@@ fying glass . this also goes with the arrows keys .
if you are in addition to the &amp; Shift ; press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; select the box window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain firm and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy to a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
starts or stops the updating of the display . the stop of the updating results that the required CPU time is 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; stimul@@ ates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse po@@ ds for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain an inhibit@@ ing syndrome ) and which every single mouse is pain@@ ed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; stimul@@ ates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse po@@ ise a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people to em@@ ulate pain on the repet@@ itive operation ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and can em@@ ulate the mouse using the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that leads to the mouse to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also depend on pain associated with the use of your computer , you should search for a doctor if this is still not done .
to make it clear@@ er again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid pain when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that applies due to the mouse , us@@ eless . and , as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be adjusted for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you break the movement short .
is the intelligent shifting enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is executed by pressing the mouse button . in this way , you can run the mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
this failure must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the set time shift shifts ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , before the mouse button is waiting again , when the mouse button will release again if no problem is done for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now , this function is enabled , followed by a break , followed by a break , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slow drop to the right and returns a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the response time , you can add the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the rider . there is a sl@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer , which you adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this attitude is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started with each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; now , this function is currently under &amp; K@@ DE ; please go to the respective documentation to find out how to automatically launch a program .
set all the settings back to the values that when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button application , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the default settings . in particular , intelligent shifting should be turned off first . if you then click to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the intelligent shifting .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; at sounds too .
first , you should be aware of what places is a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on jobs in the browser window , which doesn &apos;t represent an Link , does not lead to un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . you can therefore park the mouse to such positions until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first of all , you have to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse is different from mouse . it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball removed , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can scratch easily with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are going to use the intelligent shifting , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation doesn &apos;t stop by rele@@ asing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem consists in it that you do yourself a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse click and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the Curs@@ or to place where you want to make him . but par@@ ked the mouse on a neutral area of mind , if you encounter any key mouse click un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . safe zones for the mouse po@@ ds are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines from windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is a more advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you get to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board or move to any other promotion , when you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse button . however , there will probably be some problems with them . here are some advice on it :
do not use intelligent shifting , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . mark Text instead of writing a mouse button and hold the switch button , while you move the mouse po@@ ds to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is done every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressing a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent shifting , even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most system .
the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; actu@@ ated the mouse po@@ ste once the mouse po@@ ign@@ ant . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and which the mouse po@@ oping pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is released . in this way , pulling and locking with the mouse can be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program to talk with the dum@@ b user to talk to their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; they can talk a m@@ ute user to talk to the computer . the user can choose from a list with the conversation sets which should be spoken again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left screen photo ) enter the command , which will later be used for the voice output of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s .
on the second page , select the standard text box book . from the text box books , you often use text pass@@ ages to have to do without them . the text pass@@ ages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the word use . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can get the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elling words can be absorbed into the Wor@@ ter@@ ine .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically a input field for the keyboard circuit of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in screen ) and a running memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in screen ) .
if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the phr@@ ases you want to listen to the phr@@ ases you want . each spoken set will be attached to the default memory . you can select the phr@@ ases that will be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings c@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ th@@ ation and the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service .
in the input field of the card language issue , enter the command to call the language . in the box below , insert the character encoding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be distributed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the order for speech output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in documentation on your language generator . examples of this command can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
as the first attempt to use as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if that is successful , the further settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ uses a standardized interface for speech output , which is currently being implemented in SV@@ N . this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key passage or by selecting a text passage in the menu text box or in the memory of text box books .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the elected text passage is spoken directly and in addition to the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is initially only entered into the input field .
with the second selection box , edit the edit box for text box book , you can define whether the text box book will be stored automatically during processing the processing box .
with the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ ers , the book will be saved . if you pick up changes , the text pass@@ able book is not stored . if you select changes , the text box is not stored . please ask whether the text box is to be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ell also contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ds . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the latest online dictionary .
with buttons on the right on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add to the order of the books or export it into a file . below the list you can set the name and select language for the dictionary .
select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation one . the frequency of the individual words is determined simply by means of occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to just insert the written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these weights are to be done .
with this option , create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window for processing text box books is two divided . in the upper part , the text box books are shown as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can select a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key settings . if you have selected a text box , you can only change its name .
actions like new text pass@@ ages or books add or selected text coll@@ ages and books can either be deleted via selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
the order of text pass@@ age@@ books or text pass@@ ages you can change by drag by mouse to the new place or the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button change .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the default .
the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the default .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text in the input field is used , it is used otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the default .
if this menu entry is crossed , a separate tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged by default on the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by click on the raff@@ le left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow glue in the lower part of the main window with signs on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shift for text pass@@ able books will be displayed directly under the tool@@ bar directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the stu@@ ffed left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably have the command for the speech output not right or not fully entered . open settings c@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for language output at the card language output . ( see Settings dialog for Language Learning for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the Edinburgh University . currently , English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch is supported . the license allows to use the Festival for free to spread and without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that Festival in folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to the language issue is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently he supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free to use and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the language output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ eb@@ ie . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard entry . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it turns a list of phon@@ ills into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes the last sign of the text , so an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / / usr / local / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option data can be switched on as default input .
the speech @-@ d@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ on language support , of all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the voice of the language only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you must only use c@@ ous as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which is released in the installation dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .

&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a part of the modules existing service which enables any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . also users offer interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the Text Editor and Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications are embedded .
the language issue takes place via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the generation of voice spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech @-@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language issue service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .

in addition to the bug@@ z@@ illa @-@ database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility . you can also find the developer in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops , you &apos;ll need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust it correctly . see also
for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card size is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ izer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that differ in volume or speed . you can set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should use at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker .
different spokes@@ persons for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several print expect@@ ators for the same printer .
if you click on the Cart@@ ridge @-@ card speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the flash@@ card speaker is displayed automatically , when you launch the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , and yet no or@@ ator is set up .
the preferred speaker appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for the voice output if an application does not exist any speaker .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines its priority .
Click on one of these buttons to turn your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl@@ s.@@ ch@@ enst@@ im@@ me to choose from .
if you click here , the new spokes@@ man on the board card spokes@@ man . to change the settings of this speaking speaker , click on Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is already almost to use . go back to flash@@ card General and check if language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed , so that the T@@ TS service is able to read and manage to read text . Click to create text orders to create text orders and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the play@@ list of &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the card bund@@ le of General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this start succe@@ eds , and you can create text orders and read records . see . remove the mark , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ on ; continue to activate the box output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is complete .
with buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop , stop and absorb .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; read or read a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
Click on users or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card size and activate language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ on@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if you want to read the text , read and select in the main menu tool@@ box . after a short time , the language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ tension lines and other invisible brands also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text before . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then mark the text that should be read and select in the main menu tool@@ box . then the language output starts .
this also works if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta .
K@@ emer@@ e is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you notify you of fixed events . you can read the text of this news from &amp; dict@@ ts ; read .
in &amp; context ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can send different types of messages . you can notify &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation , for example , if you arrive in a IR@@ C channel , in which your nick@@ name comes first . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message message .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ emer@@ e , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . here are possible settings for K@@ emer@@ gen@@ cies depending on application .
filters for the character chain design provide a good opportunity to correct and correct messages . it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages sent to the mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be accepted in most cases than provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in fil@@ tering the text is edited before being sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to replace the speech or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of language tra@@ ilers and their voices .
to understand the references of fil@@ tering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen reag@@ ents has the highest priority . it will be prec@@ eded to all other orders and holds these orders . if the issue of screen Reader is read , the orders will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has prec@@ e@@ dence and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Not@@ ations are also news . read on .
the rest are simple text orders . any order that you get from the card card orders is a text job . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special pressures .
all four order types are processed in qu@@ eue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; dict@@ ts ; just such an reads , this issue will hold and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reag@@ ents . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , text orders and on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ messages .
filter edit the text and add it to the next filter . at the time there are three kinds of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there can be more kinds of filters .
character chain ten@@ sion@@ er replace parts of a text by other text . it is supplied with pre@@ defined strings chain filters , which can be used with pre @-@ defined strings chain hardware , such as : - ) through text or for the form@@ att@@ ing messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) um &amp; XML ; provided by a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker systems , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ops , send to a speaker . if you have set a female voice , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about this . sie@@ ve about it .
each of these various filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a language output . if the filter is fixed , it does not apply the text to the next filter .
when a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification on &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent to them by all activated filters , which were set up in the page below . editing the filter is performed in the order in the list below .
this displays the list of incoming normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated , and is not used . filters will be removed from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following entries are displayed below .
for the establishment of character chain filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns are exchanged in text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and small @-@ mail will not be considered compared to comparison .
specify a name for your filters . you can choose this name , it must only distinguish between the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown in the shown order from top to bottom .
Click here to shift the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions to store the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text contract is one of the registered languages . Click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button .
if here is a value registered , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , mail
you will receive the q@@ d@@ bus application program with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must leave you . if , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID cou@@ pler @-@ 34@@ 32 is possible , you can only copy copying .
the string chain filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if agreed . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character chain filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited on both sides ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; check out in the package am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ form@@ ulations . but it can only be used on well @-@ shaped XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program must be installed on your system .
enter the path to the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achie@@ vable via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
speaking with the Speaker filters you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board card speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can set for example , that text of k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before reading a text on the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker will send a speaker for the text , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops , and send the characteristics of the speaker @-@ speaking speaker . with the Speaker filters you can write the chosen speaker .
if here is a value registered , the filter is used if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; check out this with one click on the button to get help from entering .
in order to achieve a faster processing , you should try the regular expression at the beginning of drawing chain , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the requested speaker system . if the text meets the above @-@ shown filter conditions , the speaker is chosen , which matches the desired requirements on the one button , click on the button to display the dialogue selection .
use these buttons to store or delete any settings , or delete any settings .
the speech recognition filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the language output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with language and synthes@@ izer ; these synthes@@ izer can use these synthes@@ izer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the language issue API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is will be available on K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of text to read and option to read language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , please enter
open two &amp; console ; window . only run tom@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
no one of the mentioned language synthes@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ former@@ filters are set , but when using the module for festival will not read websites .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to install S@@ able at all . if you don &apos;t have to do this voice for reading websites . also , make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found via the P@@ AT@@ H environment .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation symbols seem to cause errors in synthes@@ izer , so that the phr@@ ases are over@@ spr@@ inkl@@ ed or only Kau@@ der@@ lo@@ in . what can I do against it ?
first make sure that the option is set on the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this possibly can be fixed by a character chain filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with each language pair , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , select the description of synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for language and synthes@@ izer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops , for use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , set up with the team team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filters is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages c@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ops , from the source text for k@@ icking , or have downloaded the target of Tar@@ ball to each night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first whether you are using your speech disp@@ at@@ cher with your language and synthes@@ izer correctly . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which will be used for the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script SPD conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sets . the user can re@@ go or return , repeat the output or break off .
if an application goes on &amp; kt@@ ops , for example , if you have set up a female speaker for the output . if you want a speaker , the language is English and his sex is female , this is automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker cho@@ oses to see you in after .
if you click on the flash@@ card speaker on adding , and to insert a speaker into the list or click on edit , the card card speaker facility is displayed . as an example , the module is shown for Festival Interactive . details on the modules you will find below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path comes to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter a festival .
select the coding for text that will be handed over to the festival . if votes , the &amp; kt@@ ops are known , this setting will automatically be done automatically . in general , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or slo@@ vak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of control and displayed this grey , the chosen voice will not be chosen from you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded after their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are loaded already at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box can not be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forget to click on users ) .
if this check box is marked , it is displayed at the launch of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system stage , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system stage to display the program window .
if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area when K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the opportunity to read or control the opportunity .
here are all orders in the qu@@ eue , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just processed proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can choose sat@@ in in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system stage . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
here only text orders will be listed and administ@@ rated . issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News will not appear . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or comp@@ ress ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you &apos;ll need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PCM device . see also
put the talk speed here . 50@@ 6 ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ g ; % about the double normal talk speed . thus , these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
to use the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ops , click on application .
the list of AL@@ SA devices covers all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions , which will always be executed if the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four kinds of language contracts :
the output of screen reag@@ ents has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ gged to all other orders and holds these orders . after reading the screen reader , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web site , you can read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you could enter the room .
a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning , or copy of a Screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; dict@@ ts ; the audio output in the qu@@ eue a long time .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text contract is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card @-@ card are only valid for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings , and expenses of screen reag@@ ents , there are no special actions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; read K@@ emer@@ e messages , restart kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the card messages appears .
mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Let them turn off . if this attitude does not marked , the rest settings are disabled and run ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
if this attitude is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , by &amp; dict@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation , when someone menti@@ ons your nick@@ name in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; dict@@ ts ; igno@@ res .
use this selection field to determine what &amp; dict@@ ts ; if an event meets , you have the following selection :
if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the properties of the requested speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on flash@@ card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . is executed for a specific event of a specific application , this is executed . otherwise , the promotion has been implemented for all other events of the specific application . as the last possibility , the promotion has been specified as the standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list ) . for this , you can define the pre @-@ ending noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button to store the settings for the messages in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with a blank list , click on del@@ eting . all entries except All noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language output . this standard contains marks for the control of voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ation . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or pitch is set at the festival configuration dialog , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and sat@@ in @-@ recognition filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start reading text in single sets , as only the first proposition must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text card . thus , you can also jump or stop or stop or stop , even if the language of the language does not support them directly .
here you see the recognition filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , it is automatically set up as a pro@@ positi@@ onal filter system automatically . you can change its settings or add other sat@@ c@@ lim@@ it@@ eration filter , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
in the easiest way , you will learn the setup of speech choices by selecting . switch on the card selection , change some features and check out how the choice of speaking speaker is changing . you must , of course , have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading faster with the fore@@ reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last a long time ,
you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card @-@ card order , even if the language of the language does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filter is automatically set up when you launch the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , unless removed . do not change in this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
sat@@ in @-@ recognition filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the proposition limits ( tabl@@ ature files are removed from the text ) . note that the default set @-@ up filter controls the character composition .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ ) , War@@ nings , News or the Edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you are removed out of default , you can insert this again by setting the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file ; it contained standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card reader , you can write the speech settings for the application . the card size is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the board card speaker ) . in other words , no inter@@ related features are specified .
use of the most suitable microphone , which has all characteristics of a furnished speaking speaker . if you don &apos;t delete the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; dict@@ ts ; this speaker is chosen ; otherwise it cho@@ oses &amp; dict@@ ts ; the speaker , which corresponds to the originally introduced properties .
select the method for entering the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if your language synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer which is open source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you need to install at least one language . help to read the instructions that will be supplied with Festival . would you like to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to limitations in the transfer .
this voice uses Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / russian / . if you enter the Russian votes , you have to enter for the Vo@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look at the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of the network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center is displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting from the contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; drop menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical equipment and their drivers have already functional and configur@@ able , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all and allows the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed on installation hardware and Linux . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network setting is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when connected network settings , this used platform will be automatically recognis@@ able .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the different selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release will be best . by adjust@@ ing the setting of non @-@ rest@@ oring , the fixed setting can be permanently taken . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings can only be viewed in system management mode . previously , all options are grey , which means the settings can only be considered , changing system management mode at the right bottom of the module mode . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode the whole functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interface serves to manage the system &apos;s network devices . all available network devices will be displayed . from the tab network interface , the following tasks can be carried out :
the connected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button of the button ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking on Advanced Settings displays the dialogue with further possibilities .
with the option Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is performed at each system start@@ up , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the select list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the option Manu@@ ally , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , TCP / IP configuration can be performed . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not requested , this option should not be activated .
the values are displayed in this dialog as characteristics of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network should not be used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch @-@ up of a designed network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and click interface ...
specify the IP address of the computer in local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for the TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is connected more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway Computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . that &apos;s necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name solution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNA entries can be arranged through a selection of a contract and back@@ drop or table @-@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons or to be converted to priority .
by clicking the button add ... from the group machine to name the name solution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first , you must enter the IP address of DNS server and then click the button . then the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button . it will display the dialog Edit .
the list of known hosts describes host @-@ to @-@ IP address mode for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server are available . in small , sealed networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally contains the list of known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this still in the testing version of IP is to replace 4 in the future Version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The New alias is displayed .
add the name of the well @-@ known host and add the button add . if the well @-@ known hosts has multiple alias name , button add several times and enter the other alias name .
select a version of a well known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings specified in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console , with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical user like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE are sufficient ; but in addition , development packages will be needed with libraries and other things .
this will only be experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental networks are given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; trans@@ changeable configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . number 5 has never found large spread . from IPv6 , it is expected to pass through in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is to as@@ sign a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the contact site that will be used to be a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be selected as any event .
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from one specifically for this purpose reserved area to avoid IP address associated with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below will not be for@@ warded by the Internet . therefore , their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks usually use addresses in the 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 area . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard Route , the second one lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is needed for the IP continuation .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed in DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is defined there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a safety program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was to create a surface for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer does it take when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen on three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; put the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the band . recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the incident on the band will not be asked whether the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ell , it is searching for the appropriate index on your disk . can &apos;t be found , you will be asked whether the band index should be re@@ created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the band was integrated . in the Status Bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band .
before throwing the tape , the inclusion must be solved initially . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; announces a change in the symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be thrown out without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not need to form@@ at@@ ted that a band can be form@@ at@@ ted before use . Flo@@ ppy @-@ tape drives usually have a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape , DA@@ T drives cannot be form@@ at@@ ted .
after entering the band called and the capacity is &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the band are lost , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the saf@@ est files . this can happen on three types :

mark files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
Click on the right mouse button to the local file tree and select in the She@@ chem menu ...
as soon as the backup was introduced , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears backup . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folder are checked .

once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking .
if you confirm the settings for checking , the dialog appears checking . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process , as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can restart the restart , the files must be restored , selected . this can be done on two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives listed for the tape drive . it &apos;s only restored the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives mit a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders will be restored .

once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears to restore . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
when you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog appears re@@ produce . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process , as well as data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band &apos;s content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
this ensures a coll@@ ision profile with just selected files and default settings . you can make for a safety profile the following settings :
the current working folder , in which the backup should be done . the list of the saf@@ est files is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored in the same file system , such as the folders . folder , which are based on other file systems , you can set separately on backup files . each entry is viewed from tar ir@@ respective of the others .
conducting an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last minute backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files saved have been changed since .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ cre@@ di@@ ment@@ ary f@@ use .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set you on the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... settings in the menu settings . make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must be distributed to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the band &apos;s device .
this attitude is active , communic@@ ated &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command load load on the drive . in some drives it is necessary to be performed before reading or writing operations .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the cast off at tape drive . possibly this attitude does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when sol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically cast the band . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size is required for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is set together as follows :
( n bytes ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is host : seconds , whereby the host name is the full name of the system , on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which have been form@@ at@@ ted since the period in which the band was form@@ at@@ ted .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives , which can operate directly with &amp; GNU / tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act to create incre@@ mental coll@@ ages .
check the contents of a backup association . this icon is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer viewer for in@@ experienced users can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system or where the system allows quick access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer works in the background . is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems which appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some extended functions , with their help the protocol files can be filtered and analysed .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of protocols , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g Ser@@ vers and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included , and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , presents &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; features available , with whose help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file can easily filter and sort out . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after start &amp; ks@@ system@@ log , first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , and it will be held instead of a small message window . the protocol files are usually found in folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not own permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter out a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to set the strings in the filter bar . in the default settings the selection box will be displayed next to the filter line . then , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included .
you can also select another record , of course , only with entries in the set file system protocol , then select the column process in accordance with the option of a process , and choose the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; all protocol @-@ lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level error will be displayed with a more striking colour than protocol lines of the stage . the colour display of protocol @-@ lines can be posted .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command , such as for example , to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ types . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you select a window , select a protocol to display the menu .
&amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ System@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ . D@@ ort you will find further information about the source of &amp; ks@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; also in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; Subversion archive : ks@@ System@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system is rapidly developing as standard for programming of programming in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ der file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because anyone could try to set a machine on System V In@@ it , without any re@@ installation and re@@ form@@ work . that &apos;s why you need to be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub @-@ file of / etc are directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service to start the system or change to another lap level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services are not having such items such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie below / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not require a lot of use in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something when you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a row like the following :
at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably notice that the default set @-@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can manually repair it , then you will manually repair it by restart the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no right files are available . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts are so written that there is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish you a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running , that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index is simple to say not tri@@ vial : simply draw one entry from the range of availability of availability to one of the six laps to start at this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or move the position within one level by going to go somewhere else . this is not only removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they draw one entry from the field of availability .
note : entries are moved if you select this in a new range . to select it only on a new Run@@ level , you need to select explicitly copy from the menu Edit or add to the target range -- even then , if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries in the tr@@ ash . be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the different working ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection Ober@@ - or below the previous .
to shift one entry into another lap level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change sorting order or change the name of a entry manually , press the tab button to change between different fields . connect the dialog through re@@ pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings will be saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; again . changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine will start constantly ane@@ w . what can I do ?
enter the li@@ lo Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have planned some systems services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you have to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the way , such as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , but does not simpli@@ fy the configuration of proprietary systems from the distribution , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply complete without news if your configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have done modifications , you have to store them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry save in the menu file .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . first if you can make extended system settings , you will be able to make individual settings , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uniform .
the flash@@ card password administration appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uniform .
this card Card appears only if you have to activate and initi@@ alize in at least one @-@ connected fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) , and initi@@ alize ( recogni@@ zable to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for any user , whereby the plac@@ ements are available in KB .
these parameters can be set individually , for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field of file system .
the card groups inform@@ s information about the category of selected user . the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the primitive group . furthermore , users can select in other groups by mark them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , create this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the user or group or click on the matching adding button of the tool bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the li@@ lo boot@@ manager , adding and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , change and more .
