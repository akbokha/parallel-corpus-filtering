<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists of a so-called folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each item is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property of the larger objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or a folder represents the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries in it. according to this way, big files can be detected, even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be viewed as an graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, is an entry in the Treemap presentation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the rectangles of sensual colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched on the view of color mode, can be either a depth for the light detection of the pollution or the image of another file association as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder. for any feature, you can specify if there is enough space to display, or if the area of subordinates can occur or if the area of subordinates can occur or if the surface is set out by limitations when signs of Treemap. furthermore, you can define the relative position of signatures in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In manufacturing algorithms for treemaps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to display the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always available to show the expiration of entries, and this framework need place, which is lost, then the lower entries is lost if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the division of the area is done to the subordinated entries, the implementation will be left. in this case, it is necessary for the labeling and avoidance of space losses by setting always advantageous to create spaces that are as possible as square. the best methods of this regard are lines, columns or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimal area for one entry on the menu entry. instead, a sample pattern in the area of the ordered entry is drawn, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is used as a USB mass storage device. the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiz used the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is also a free, advanced software collection for digital cameras which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos are generally large and transmissions about the serial port is slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digif; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras are available below this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support, so the EXIF support is required by some libgphoto2 camera drivers. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you might be able to see any pre-image or the production could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly about your memory location. if you are able to take pictures on your disk. if you make enough photos, then you'll use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then you can print a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% Archives and 5% work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata store in the installation page of the metadata in & digial; this ensures that exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forgot this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change? for this, & digists; to them a metadata Editor for a number of selected attributes available. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should select any photo keywords, labelling and evaluation. of course, you can then select all images that will need the same attribute and set the value then. it makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now take you with keywords, keywords, as you are frequently called by other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued pictures from another source with embedded keyword, then it is & digil; automatically add the pictures to the right place. the reversal of the hierarchy is not problem and can easily be done by using a sub-tree on another. the modified keywords are being pursued by & digif; updated during the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata is exaggerated. this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata exists in truth out of many sections. filenames and calendar data will show properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to cataloguate your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to simply see most of your pictures simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then start some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Landeplatz of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy. Wow! one starts to dreaming, associations, the historical time span is present again, you might even hear the silence. the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others consider your photos look more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell you a story. remember, the key is the meaning of viewer to help Him to help Him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine, if a picture is not perfect, if it is the strength only with a lettering for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digists; you can also store a lot of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), and you can even export it for a selection of images. so you'll have to tell it for your wishes into the labeling and / or title of Web-Galeriesystems.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? good, because with pictures, the train of the spatial presentation is already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for geolocalization are already incounter-reaching and will be able to review your journeys with geographical data. you can also export your journeys with geographical data. you can also export the pictures on the entrance. you can also export the pictures by Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the googlee viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also available in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setting side of & digil came; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and author): this field should be your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not requested, the name of a company or organization can be used. after which the value was saved, it should not be changed. this field does not support nor Semikolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for the author): linked with the author. this field contains the description of the photographer. examples of this field can be titles, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merrk to the author field, this must be also completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for providers): use the Anbieterfeld to identify who is the photo. if the photographer has been listed here as a Reuters or Associated Press, then you can see the picture here. if the picture is a warehouse photo, here the group / agency offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. everyone who has a little more than base knowledge in work with calculator can use this, in the image embedded metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the picture. & digif came to provide such a module for staple processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record defect, power cut, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disinformation, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs on the street or a fire. this type of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is a problem with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that have a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious must be treated and you can't buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you are good disks and good attachments and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. therefore it turns the right to choose.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible for mistakes, even if you have just been writing. therefore, they use a control mechanism for use. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protection it comes to chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favourable program called IsoBuster's apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux. it is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to the damaged floppy disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the Formatwar against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all of which has been said to CDs and DVDs, of course, is also used for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good admission application on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also, you should leave the media with a description, date & author license and then on a clean, dark dry and protected animals protected place. do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy disks keep your statistics for itself. their manufacturer details include a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a large field study about troubleshooting of hard drives: floppings</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos keep the longest in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower temperature scores the most common error cause, SMART can not determine this error. some of the SMART provided this error. this is especially lesbian and publishing houses. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only about the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a power output before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally made without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make up much, it looks differently with devices with computer chips and high-speed processor. these can cause heavy damage, complete data loss, hardboards and other defects. protect themselves before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is part of energy resources absorbed and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug bar. but remember that not every plug-bar contains even an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightening and thereby protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should also know that all peripherals are connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable fashion, which can also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable-modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage guard your system protects your system before smaller variations in the power lines, it will not really help you. even a fall of a few seconds can lead to the loss of intolerable data. therefore, it may be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overlashings, these devices can automatically set up to store the system if a power cut off. if you buy a USV, you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare its security in electricity problems with the cost to avoid. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected. at the end you should always remember all the cables before you ride to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the correct configuration you can use this as drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destinations for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives at home, however, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. furthermore, you have to send data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services which are limited to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB. the professional version provides you more at your disposal, in the event of Flickr more. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very secure. data transmission errors are automatically adjusted due to the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a partial storage. thus, they are desasterably.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are due for transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs are at least the data integrating between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you should have been destroyed in your computer. it is quite worrying that there is no protection to your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Reliable network parts are a further source for transfers, since they create interference within the data streams. in normal file systems these mistakes remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transfers problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle drivers at lower level and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms the tender and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are not underestimated! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. in Notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most. it leads to a lower damage, as such as theft or newinstallments. and it is currently being restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; yet no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JRC and XFS to name the common file systems. a very good English article you will find here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examining process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic of all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixels. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result, a sensor size of 6 Megapixel and a high-quality look are the optimum solution for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You'll get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so you make no problem affected by a data loss. so you can secure your data from a plan and test this backup before you can make anything dangerous like the reinstalling your operating system, making an exchange of disks or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your safety on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a lightning bolt hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. forget an aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Hence, desastervoring means no local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs up into the neighbouring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, is more common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a securing that is not immediately available, you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete restoration. this creates a complete moment of time to two time points: the complete set-back and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incrementing fuse: a backup of the files changed since the last backup. generates several moments ago. you can restore the original status at any time. this fuse comes with a versioning system on the next with the exception that it had been sampled and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily setup your machine. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions, or other types of file transfer script. copied to the difference of files that have been changed. this happens if compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come to a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment of the working files. at the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly momentary for each month. every other dilution should be done manually after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original memory, scalability, media, re-finding pictures and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures can survive the next 40 year, that is approximately the period of time you really interested in you because they are interested in your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseeable because of your nature needs to be careful with caution and re-evaluate it during the time. unfortunately, there is no other option to be compatible with caution. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system, you can then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with the area and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and put it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it on.</seg>
<seg id="235">& coding; dd if = / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBs; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32, and ReiserFS / dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of motorerFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day isn't able to read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard developed by GIF. but it is loss of loss, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata. the downside is that it has a relative number of administration information, but not as many as TIFF and requires a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as image format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression-free compression. however, there is more than 50 different types. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on TIFF / EP format and required for use of metadata. it is a handful camera manufacturer DNG now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored in an extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format to archive archived. however, it can be related to problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards and support the activities of DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifying efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are on the camera production, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your Roharchiv. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For an enemy processing, you can use external programs. if you return the pictures with & digists; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it only then in web galleries, add in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiate. in the section, adding a photos to an album you can add a description, how you can already have photos that you already have on your hard drive, but you can add many advanced settings for importing pictures to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digif; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator will appear at the bottom and the presentation pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not appear on the camera. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to watch the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a details or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information that are internally stored on the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that there are not any information available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata as EXIF, manufacturer preview, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digif; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into one single album in & digif;. when downloading the pictures are not deleted, we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to delete the pictures from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired of the standard input methods of & KDE. once you select the photos, you can download the button and then select the chosen button. the button will be downloaded long until you've selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is downloadable. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digif; downloadhere. if you choose this option, the new pictures are downloaded, of course only the new pictures downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download or download the buttons, select a dialog with which you can choose the target album, displayed in the photos. list of existing albums will be displayed as normal files you can read in section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having selected the target album, press OK, and & digiate; invites photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete any delete button. if you want to delete messages, you need to select it first and delete the delete chosen chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore pictures you deleted from the camera. you should not verify that the photos are successful in one & digif; -album downloaded, before you want to delete it out of camera. if you want to delete the camera settings, you should make it much faster than this camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos frequently not especially meaningful name. this can be deleted again after the photos from the camera was deleted. therefore, it can be sensible, the date and time when the image has been taken to integrate it into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and spears of the picture and for datalogy bases. if you use these latter option, automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options, which are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. switch to the option's date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the possibility to change the filename into small case letters. or in case of capital letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiate; used for a photo, is displayed below the name, displayed the camera in the preview. your settings for rename will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digil; can use any information on the orientation of the camera to the time-point recording, to perform a automatic rotation during the heart. not all cameras make this information ready. in the sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and when your camera doesn't supply this information, it leaves & digists; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera was done on the date, where the photo was made, it can be & digil; this underlines are uploaded to the image data. all cameras with the same date are uploaded into the same album. not all cameras make this information available. in the sidebar Meta-Data, you can read what information your camera could be embedded in photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & digil; the photos directly on the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button extended and select the option of the date-based signage at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button. then select the upload dialog box & KDE. you can then select the files you want to upload the uploaded file. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digil; you, where the images are uploaded. a folder-selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that is indicated in length and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can link it an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot, where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiate; users want to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is well to enrich the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 offers many GPS data fields, such as the direction, saddle and maps are supported. directly with the correct hardware, via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera which integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS recipients. either as a card module or by transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. but you have to store these data in the GPX format, as it is the only format to support the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS used to extract the data from images and of the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script which works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs ordered by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, all the navigation details for Europe show.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digif came to give you much control over his work processes as possible. there are many attitudes to change the behaviour of & digif; to set up on these settings, you need to set up in the Settings menu. you can change between these settings, by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">In action, you can view or start image editing on embedded preview. you put the default behavior of & digif; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacy and copyright data. this data will automatically be written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, when the option to download from the camera system. this data is also written with a database synchronisation, this data is written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. these can be used as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description to the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publishers is a synonym for provider: use this field to give the photo. this must not be the author, as such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then the group should be listed here, then the group / agency should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the respective IPTC-rim. thereby, the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digil;. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digil; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labelling as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you can add to your pictures, with the images embedded in pictures. attention: with images that already contain labelling, these are overwritten by the digiants.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse indicator is in the main window above one file. depending on option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digifted; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to determine which file types & digiate; show, you can add the file expansion of this list and remove any file extensions, which has no one of these extensions, ignored by & digil; ignores.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminous & digival; can be set on this page on the default values. any pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can only get on fast computers. if you have one, then you can obtain better visibility results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing used a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underlined areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter color on the image. these colors are fixed here. in the image processing can be inserted with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the pictures can be coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the next declaration.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation is not reducing the image quality, because PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. the only effect is that the image data is more time to trigger and unpacking. if you have a fast computer, you can use this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option you can compress the deflate compression balm for TIFF files. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality since the deflate algorithm uses loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss of loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can lossless store. even if you select the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digil; the image processing was only one image viewer for photographs. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The idle speed is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light as the pixel at odd-violet light. if you use this option, this difference is a little soft, eliminates this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option records the picture a bit soft, eliminated but the 2x2 gene pattern using the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the bald is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the bald is not set. default is it a fixed color balance used on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD cameras. using the second sensors, the effect of the second sensors have the effect that subjugated images will get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top, so the parts of your pictures are burned down, because of the inability of your camera shows up, because of the inability of your camera displays the top speed. finally, you can try to redesign some parts of the missing information from the top-light.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because the blue pixels generally did not work as fast as green and red. and dcraw therefore try to redesign the missing green and red parts out of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the picture options of the & digival; to keep the time for the demos, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-based algorithm is a digital image process to provide a complete picture of the partial image sensor that have many cameras and which have a Matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digil; and dcraw also put you three alternatives to you: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD-Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color documents in the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils, you can set the red and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you will be performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions about it again. there are also LCMS and & digiate; information like the color content of a color space in the other are to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">When an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digil; examine these folders then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profile to rear. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profile should be used to use the camera manufacturer and model that you can use. not all profiles are contained in the same way. currently there is some, like Canon, which does not have any color tonmapping or gamemcorrection. currently, it corrects that you need to perform the tone tone themselves for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate, as your printer may have a smaller color area than your camera and some colours, therefore, you might correct, rather than leaving your printer's blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious which paint profile for them is intended for what is intended. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion can be seen the style for the purpose: F for an accurate style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & KDE; image personnel and image processing is supported. many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules installed, see a list of available modules. select the modules you want, and these modules are then loaded from & digif. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you can see some of them in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu below Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper regulator is the time between image transitions, normally they are 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes switch the metadata or out which appears at the bottom end of the pictures during display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show a list of all the cameras supported on the left side. if you want to use one camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use it, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in image display mode. at present, serial port, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire cameras (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / s, specify your camera on your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digists; you need to connect the camera to your computer, remove them in the ad mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digists; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; Pictures in the trussing, you can set the conversation of & digil; when deleting a photos in an album. in the deletion of a photos and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down through & digival; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without queries. otherwise, you must apply changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also substrate the display of the Welcome-screen of & digil; substrate the starting point of & digiate under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The startup start looking for new photos are forced & digiate; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos came out; if something from the base folder was deleted, asks & digil; you know whether it should be deleted from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digif; used to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can select under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in writing a new design for & digists; to create, you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digil; contains a fast image processing with some base tools. you can use these to check your photos and to correcting and improvement. image processing can be started through a click on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of details / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them stand as modules in & digiate; therefore, they are not part of your distribution. more information on the KIPI modules can be set up in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current date number, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions can change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo before you save file save or the button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't restore the original photo once you have stored the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should have a copy of your picture before you change it. this allows you to save file save than.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using from the menu file, or use the button The button restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every promotion of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can return, by selecting editing or restored, by selecting editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the key abbreviation, Ctrl; -z to return and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; you can press a moment on the back or restore button in the tool bar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all promotions will be re-established or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can use between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar, picture above or the entries in the menu file. if you have made any changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the Ansican menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlargement factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode. usually, you can then use the toolbar. normally, you can also change the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can call it from the & digif; main window. see the section for setup of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture you can print in the menu file image and get the Standard & KDE; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print some pictures or whole phrases. all image files can be printed from your selection. you must only select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exporting printer assistent. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digival; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, the important information and actions for the selected pictures are available. the same sidebar is available, also available in image editing. it is displayed if one of the five horsemen is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the ventilating view, you can enter or insert the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2,000 characters. all comments are being cut off after 2000 characters and special characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented, you either use the button application or change simply to the next picture, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this, you can read further metadata from the selected file or the database. but you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be selected if you have chosen a metadata settings, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section review shows a rating schema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can always be used with a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the key-abbreviation Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written into the IPTC field. the coding follows below the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keyword, the keyword and a selection box with the previously in this & digival; -session installed positions.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adapted dynamically. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom of the lower end is a further relief from the input at a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by trademarks of the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If more pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this only applies to the highlighted image and not to choose the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar code filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed. normally, the left side bar uses their album, - data, sampling and viewpoints. if in addition, one or several sample filter from the right side is used, only the cut quantity of these two are displayed. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull out and lay down. suppose you have chosen several images in the main view. if the keyword exists, you can simply draw it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. as a result, a dialogue that you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the sample filter is reduced to no keywords, which was chosen by Ctrl + a, and after that, a keyword from the right keyword will be taken into the selection and placed there. a dialogue asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be turned off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and create and notice that it should be a or, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, searching for the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or character chain that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Advanced search via all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then button the button. see the options below:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to back the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I was mainly adapted to & digiate; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you can print a color administered workflow, you can achieve the colors on your camera or scanner. with a colored workflow you can achieve that the colors print on your monitor from your camera or scanners are the colors that you print or in the web publish from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons does not need to make for the results he wants. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorials is to give you sufficient background information about color management. in addition to you, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows are fulfilled every six below, then you have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB-color space. (more information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other aspect of images are by e-mail or the web, where the RGB of the de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy, why should we use another color space and make your thoughts about color indulgents?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limiting from sRGB compared to the colours we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the huffisenshaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color flowers, please visit Bruce Lindbloom excellent site and then click on information and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the sRGB-color space or not, you need to switch your monitor. if you're in the color space of sRGB, you'll need to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. use it before attempting to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, automatic and contrast increase from the menu Corrigating auto correction automatically try to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled down the whole image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible is often used without its color shading. this function is often a Magical correction for images which are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Equal: this method is adjusted the luminous factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channels is as flat as flat. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrasts of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the entire histories.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast ratio: this method improves the contrast and the luminous values of the RGB values of the image by postpone the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new jireation of all values. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The tinge of & digiz came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white abduct of one photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is something limited to a color space with 8-bit per colour. if you can carry out the tinge in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a tinclaw of paste protected by Pawel T. Jochym. it is starting with the menu entry colors white abstaining of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both original image and preview of the target image can be seen. if you want to see the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, then it is enough to click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target audience has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pipes under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right, a histogram is shown that you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small Luminous values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadows alignment allows you to improve the shadows of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the aforementioned checks, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and later on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white-circle. on this type, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the Weißremovable with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overclock detector increases the colours if more than a color channel of the piper can be overexposed. this is displayed as a pure indicator as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons save as and store just make this. any adjustment of the white plug that you have set you hereby save in a text file and download again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings will keep all the filter values back on their default values and corresponding neutral white-comparison list. note that there are also neutral settings a different photo as your original. if you store this, your original picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coefficients per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality images. this coding requires also more record, calculating time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG for the formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog like the processing of raw pictures. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the Helligations. a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles you can draw the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colours. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so you can always make them the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you find below colours Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiance; tool colour defects provide you four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect of the picture was completed. the colour, dark areas sheltered the delicate tones of dark and colours by the second illumination. this tool was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar panel. at approx. 50% intensity, the figure shows what is possible to use chemically. another increase is finally a negativity that is not to create photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel effect. the original image is the (1) and this is handled (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. it differs from a saturation that it makes a stronger contraction effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it simply, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name manufactured by the Japanese company Fujifilm. this name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strong saturated colors are also made in detail of the choice of natural photography. Velvias strong saturated colors are also a few photographer, especially those who had hardly any landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon. in large pictures, the filter can lay the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color counter and the luminance of your photos with the tools in the menu below colours. once you are satisfied with the results you can use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in bad light conditions, you can reduce the reverse problem: one too large saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to increase the saturation instead of increasing. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple leukness / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve exposure of exposure. even if the dialog box is very complicated for this tool, you need to explain the three sliders below the histo program.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a grapher of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. among the graphs are three sliders to change the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the regulator and to watch out how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture may be considered. the preview will be dynamic, updated on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is frequently represented. in pictures the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic distribution is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the medium tones, commonly called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinets can be used in the preview of the original image used to automatically adjust the input of the shadow, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each range. there are also two controls which can be used in order to change the output values, e.g., the compression of output values can be used as background, while making something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically set the images automatically depending on the values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store as and store: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and later loaded again. the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use these mode and use the three color pipette, the input will be automatically adjusted to all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the colour pipette to use and click on the preview of the history program for red, green, blue and Luminating channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Translator's option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and you indicate the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically in dependence on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere Channel: this selection box allows the channel to be used by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera. in this case, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short text to the right, for example, the bright sounds, you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dark procurement, and that are darker imagery.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red selection. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Store as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you can create this in the file system and later be loaded. the file format is the Gimp spa format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color piping buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. enable the color pipette to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminating curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Translator's option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result, meaning you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminating canal. shadow and sun tones was set with colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digival came; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels, or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool to mix the colour tones of the images. you can edit it from the colors-to-mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison on its own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target system has a red markers. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to use this channels. if you also activate Luminance, then the channel blender will enable the tool to generate great black-and conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color appears in a visible smoke, which does not appear in the same place in the colour channel and whose sound pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colorless first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer adjustment can therefore store up and then load this file format. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Translator's option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and you indicate the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in the blue channel newly adjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, since color images can be converted easily on the machine. also with a set of film rollers profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford TP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good from all sceneries and fits especially well to portraits against heaven. so similar to 004 Cokin (TM) Green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filmed: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and aerial photographs. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orantes.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celtic effects and can simulate mooneness to day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotary.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates warm bright and medium tones. it is very similar to the process of wearing a pressure and recovery in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digif; tool texture can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture on your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting, a pop-type portrait of enlarged points or like a mural painting on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the light and three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text is applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the modified under (2). the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiver, tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task. an option to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under image frame, the module can be started out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, select the desired frame type with a coloured line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), cover it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: are the width of the frame in percent. the value for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important to print the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any spot. this also works at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type text, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need. the bigger the image, the bigger must be the character set. finally, select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background. the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK" once the image has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digival; tool stencil can apply a template on an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image templates apply in the image processing can be used to put templates about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions concerning size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add to maximum compressing file size. if you want to add your template of the template; template file to the & digiver; mailing list digiver-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you'll need to put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you can copy the template files. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for templates, a tree view appears, which reflects the folder structure of the template file. the selection of a folder is automatically updated the template of the template.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview, three buttons can be found with which you can change the enlarging factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying picture. it is centered to the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button shrinks the picture below. if you want to use the mouse position. if you want to use the template onto the whole picture, you must reduce the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to shift the picture below the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the picture will then be adapted to the front size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiate; three different tools are available for sharpness. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Nonsense mask works on the contrast to the edges to make an image sharper. indeed, it is not a little bit more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dungeons and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three, because he really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images require a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the resolution, so that sharp edges are printed on paper. the same phenomenon will observe if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more retrospeculation than normal cameras for the individuals.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG image has often been used to use internal sharpening. images in the raw format will always have to be weakened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners used a sharpening filter during the reading of the picture. if you disable this deactivate, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening interface. you can sharpens your choice with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this, as the results are not very natural: sharpening technology increases the sharpness of the edges, but also intensify the noise. in general, it is focused on the menu entry system. under Refocus, you will find further information and comparison with all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a bit soft, is much simpler than it. use the tool to make your softmark with the menu entry. use the screen window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview can help the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect. if you make the nonsense mask, noise and the impression of grats will generate in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a channel by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radios. you should therefore make images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the promised image that is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a rupture of the maximum RGB value and the difference. it can therefore define a minimal difference which is used for a caching of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpen are exempt and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digival; tool Refocus refocus on an image by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyright protected filter algorithms from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture of & quot; refocussing quot; in which it makes a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique is used to sharpening a nonsense mask. refocus is usually better results as unsharp masked. you can launch it from the menu by calling colors refocus on the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fission is much better than the Gauß 'slide. the Gauß's Fill has a very long tail, which is widely dependent on the original box. the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß' splits in most cases even very strongly influenced by distant pixels. this causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular support: this is the most important parameter for use of this module. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should place 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but watch out in Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can be reduced by artifacts. the correlation can be reduced from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can be able to help artifacts. however, values can be lower than 0.1. however, values are very bad. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will still be added to the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter when your nonsharpness filter is caused. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation modules. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select big values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameters can be set up for later, and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all cut, colour and intolerance ctures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible, but later unpleasant artifacts left.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked results as sharpening. this could cause it to be blsharp masked a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, there must always be dissharp masked. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of nonsense. it is practical, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least just as good as the nonsense mask. the FIR Viennese filters is often better with the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour scheme has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to unsufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on the methods of sharpening methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is the insharpness of the area that was evaporated in order to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinplate allows a customized color for the pupils. if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error is one of the most developed tools, to remove the artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The cast algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can also use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Fine posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass over the picture. a value of 0,9 should be considered that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the accuracy may always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you create a film gradient or CCD smoking a high value of the same pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum value factor via allitp then defines relative smoothing. therefore put this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is meant to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulation effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: is how often the algorithm run through. usually 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle length da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small. be sure that small angle should generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value so much possible and for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step length [0,1, 10]: integral step length in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more quality you can get through the choice of this option is only low. but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons save as and loading exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still be very long and have a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how pictures are removed with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black artifact that caused by a bad film camp during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiver came; smoke reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a copyright protected algorithms from Peter stern.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts which can be used by dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor smokes of the camera or moireacute; effects of incoming images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you require further information about digital cameras, you can read it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain at default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filters are needed and can be spoiled by the radius, and the color in it is smoother and thus smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to the front. if it is increased, smokers will change the edges - if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can't get more and noise or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong is not able to remove the whole space or noise tops can occur. put it to a value near the maximum if you want to lose a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the picture. we recommend either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that will be controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the picture. we recommend either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that will be controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark areas which are typically stronger, however, the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the illuminance. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius can occur on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, noise and phasenjitter can appear on the edges. it can remove smokers and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and loading: these buttons are used precisely for it. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set, can be stored in the file system and are loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected (2). the noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a bit soft, is fortunately much simpler than a picture. use a tool to make your softmark with the menu entry to the dialog. it shows the effect on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digival came; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographs.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts to remove any pictures in digital, original or retrospectively digitalised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby receives the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. the Texture is developed with another tool, the image error correction, developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frann.dll and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts Reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it creates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are to be seen in the uncompressed image. this attitude is to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons save as and shop do this. every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still be very long and have a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce like a photo with a formal noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film baskets on the faces. the original image is below (1) and this corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures can be reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts which have been created by scanning lighting and the photopapier. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiance; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hot pixel pictures featuring a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw materials photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button. the tool will detect the hot and bright pixels. they are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you connect the dark directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark picture to the correct picture. note that the assistant renotices the final image and reload this automatically in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture section and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filters with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preferences.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is an average of the neighbor pixel. it is assigned to all defecules in the block. for 1-dimensional interpolation this will be taken separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels made a distance of 1 by Pixelblock will be pulled to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel pitch will be moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less can be moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correcting on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digiants; Vignettifying correction is a tool to correct the Vignetation, i.e. subjugated corners, to correct one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, in particular the medium and large photo format, often the entire sensor range can not evenly illuminate the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there. TeleObjective will also show this behaviour in circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it has also disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise accidents effects are generated through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulating an equivalence transformation of a raw material that is used without this filter. the tool Vignettibility correction applies to the transformation with a centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignettipping correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity absorption at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, or randomly to compensate the density by a greater degree of Vigneting, reduce it by a small degree of damaging.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukness, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignettibility correction reduces the signal strength of the pixel. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target file with these options, as you only need to increase your settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle novelty of the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digival; image processing out of the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettipping correction for a picture. the original image (1) shows the vicious padding in the corners and (2) the correct picture. an inhibiting and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digival came; lenticular distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses to photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. coloured distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is treated with the general geometric distortion of lens and can be corrected the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, flawless to the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The Koefficient fourth degree corrects the remote corners opposite to the second degree. if you combine these two geometric distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second degree. with negative values can be corrected tons-shaped distortion and positive values are hoverized distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion-degree. this value affects more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils the 'corners' has the converted sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is reset the image size and thereby decreasing a correction of first degree. negative values increase while positive the image resized.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value is adjust the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortion correction. the values that you are using for your image are stored and the next startup will be used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The cargo / or cushion Correction should be carried out in front of all random or size changes. if you are best to cut this correction than all the first. if you have a painting new, the effect would be the effect evidently of falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool will show you a vertical and horizontal lines. move it to an important place, like the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in connection, you can correct the handle / hoverle distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the random tool in the menu transformer or remove them from the image processing or zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the cycous correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives, such as recordings from the front, frames and paintings is the perspective to correct the all angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you have the camera with the hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the cannular correction to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of GennGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has an Sensitive range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for a preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set to simulate footage and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO controls changes the amount of film baskets and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filters are mixed for the reproduce of infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared profile based on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original picture is below (1) and the processed image under (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the light.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiver; filter film grains is a simple to use tool to reproduce film baskets on your images, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, well-known. to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer great silversner of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to get this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy appearance especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated for control of intensity and granularity of grains. the default value is, although higher values need to be used, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film body effect on a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity is equal to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiance; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiver came; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top chooses the pin size between one and five. thicker brush are ideal for large pictures. smoothing the smoothing or, from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and that worked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and plain 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiver came; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to define a carbonicizze. the lines whose gradient are slowly changed and therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you would have chosen what scene you would have chosen to sketch out. this would be good pictures to catch them.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon record filter. the original picture (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result may still be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiver came; filters engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiver came; filter engraver is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure, in which color does not use the most important on content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monumental landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effect. it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: split the image into cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by accident effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Insharpness: wiping the picture along sternal lines that go out of a focal point. this simulates a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial insharpness: wiping the picture through rotation of the pixels around a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance protection: wiping the picture to generate the effect of a non-focused camera inse. the object seems to resign back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-sharpness: wiping the picture through horizontal movements of pixel. this simulates the infinity of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softener unsharpness: wiping the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sagittarius: wiping the picture through random shift of pixel and simulates the nonsense of being arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Insharfe: finds the paint basin in the picture and wiping them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image. as a result, it gives natural your pictures a fine appearance. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size does not allow the size of the drip size. as the drop size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures. number changes the amount and density of drops. fish pegen changes the optical effect of the drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digif; image processing is free of raindrops. use the range of tools to select the area, e.g. a face that will be free to choose. if you have to run the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regression filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by skewer or turning into the right orientation. the tools you will find in the menu transformer, turning transformer.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo floats is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture of shrinking is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture that can be found in an image? how can you find the missing information, or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here, makes a good job here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge picture. & digil; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm team has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to change the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider's new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Specify aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the new size will maintain the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is meant to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons save as and store are used precisely. any deposit for photo can enlarge can be saved as text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo vases is very fast with what it does, but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo vases by a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlarged by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. in order to cut a photo simply just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw up the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle, while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button again, the area of the photos will cut off is out. as a result, you can change the size of the area to cut off the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the accessories, use the button of the button editing in the tool bar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file save or file save under the menu file to save the redesigned photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the presentation area, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool, after the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross format. in the high-size, the greater value of the height and the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool aspect ratio is an relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog, you can set with the Max. ratio button for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation, place.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool, according to aspect ratio, saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you are stored for the next time, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data will be remirrored and not the original picture.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the gathering help allow help to set up your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elregel, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus, or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used to design your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you combine your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the unstanding divider is 1: 1,618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule will be regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquefied auxiliary lines if you connect a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. in comparison to third-regel, the golden spiral is generated a liquid line of the eye through the picture, this type of composition leads along the line of spiral and creates on this type a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. it should be something to create the golden spiral. it may be a line or different objects. this thing can only be there without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also derived from the top of the golden spirals. its vertex points are the middle points of the golden tangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to this lines can place an static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles in order to break up your frame, create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontally mirror and vertically can be used to mirror the harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines. if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. on this type, you can adjust the colour of your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal. you can repair it with the & digif; image editing and tool-free rotation. select the free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slipangle. the values on this slipcase are indicated in degrees. with the button settings you can set the sliding again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the module is available free rotation a horizontal and vertical line. after you move it via an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture, you'll find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one possibility to repair it is the function transformer cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectra transformations are carried out to a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will then be recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the top: shows the current angle at the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective, the picture will be a little bit. for individual adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments produce twice as strong effect, and you should avoid it if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After reading the perspective, you get unbeatable triangular holes at the corners. one way to bersome it is the image with transformation cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to shift a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite side. this is no turn, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Attach your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you are on default, the angle is displayed at zero. a preview of Effective will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the presentation area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help your help become a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After taking the shots, the picture will wiping a bit. for a single loop this effect is usually negligible, but two shots are twice as much distortion and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After draining the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the image with transformation cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digif came; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats are therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, of the type like this libraries compile. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digif.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize pictures geographically in the spherical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo, to localise. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data, you need a GPS track in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you correlated to the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialogue appears. in order to load a possible correlation with GPX file, you'll need to download a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data from the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic corcorrelation was performed in red. GPS track data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera is to be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The deviation for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera. lies the deviation, among them the data are merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have any trace data from one place, you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a large difference between camera and GPS lies, you can place this limits and then correlate the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place. as the dialogue set the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data at the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and fill in. select the right region and enlarge it again, until you have a passing accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite images and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Complete outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here's a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML page. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable a possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders which can be adapted to HTML. these albums are allowed to select all albums. these albums are not hierarchically indicated. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the record look and the text of the lyrics of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely self explained. if you click on a picture, a new page will also be displayed on the image. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer, cover; screen show, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated pictures. select a folder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, the file size can also be explained. all other settings are explained by itself.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Horsemary instructors allow you some of the settings from the album rider for the thumbnails, that are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user as far the action is. press Abbreak to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module creates the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to determine whether mistakes can appear during production. the web browser is automatically launched at the end to view the preview of the gallery. press Schedging to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows Ihnes to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as scripts, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mapping. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Loss is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows it to save pictures in JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is it that increases the file size, since there are no compression of the color information. this is also possible for the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under KDE-Imaging @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import / function of the metadata module, you can copy data from a picture to another. then select the import function dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to copy the metadata. the data will be copied according to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not to write in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected pictures to a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a base image file in MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled on the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can use a background colour for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that will be packed into MPEG diaschau. afterwards, you can launch the module via extras MPEG diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting to the list or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are selected using the video format, select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds the image is defined. the speed of the image is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth surface change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and path of the generated file can set you under the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file, this is integrated into the film. after you can boot all settings your wishes, you can easily drink the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can easily drink or drink a coffee, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows several pictures to print on a paper paper together in standard photoculars. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g makes sense to improve or print using the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import / or convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file, and then select the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can consider the effect of your current settings to the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now reset the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion value. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file size.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, reserves all the information of your image and uses the lossfree LZW Compressed.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you have to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format, since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG image format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file, in the JPEG image, are stored in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to break this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack-processing mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode therefore if you are safe, e.g. by testing in a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, it is helpful if this is created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix to set the starting number and timestamps.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image and increase the image of the image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in dimension. width or height of the picture is automatically chosen, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): magnitude change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option to adapt your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print solution and the size of the photopapiers. the target picture, including background size, boundary size and background colour is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before. more pictures can drag and place on the list of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures window with the pictures displayed in selected images are displayed. you can add more images to the displayed images. for the last selected image, a preview of the page is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and add in order to add a list of images to sening pictures.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove pictures from the list of visible pictures from the list of imagined pictures.</seg>

<seg id="917">& photo album; offers you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures; the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other than module available (see). in the following part of the user guide, the integrated version is written to create the HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each area will be described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of overlap and a description that should contain the HTML-file later. on a photo album; HTML example page, you see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next you choose whether a & photo album; -Export file is supposed to be created on the review page. nourishing information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last you can select what information on the HTML pages must be displayed. as a result, you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer. for example, that all pictures of a party are obvious. for example, you can't use all pictures of a party. for example, you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages are to look like. most installation possibilities are unique, which is why not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images. thus, those you have to consider using your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer at your site can change the resolution at any time. it can therefore be fixed your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, as well. if it wants to be a larger image, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this installation area, place the various folders and the URL, where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best you choose a base folder for all your HTML files and each subsequent set a new sub-folder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder, in which all your pictures are stored. this folder will be saved and select the next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can verify that this really can choose all of the viewer. if you have been created for the base folder, a web browser has started. the URL, which you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files are not yet in the final destination folder you need to copy them manually. thus, the import function, see, correct, you need to specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above are related all three on basic folders and URLs. in these, a sub-folder was created, whose name is set up in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you can, of course, you might need a HTML page to view the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & photo album; this work is not even going to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import and imports others in your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether the images can be stored in the file, that you may have all images in the file, and this file can be so independent. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file from either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file search the pictures on a double way. first, images are not found in the folders of the .kim file. if the images are not found, you are searched for creating the HTML files. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file via HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for the export of images is described, which you can export via the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act on internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In case of manual the .kim file, you'll need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the .kim file copy & kphoto album; images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it normally doesn't want to compress the files. if you want to compress this, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size limit. if you are sending your friends pictures, you would like to send the pictures maybe not in full size since the .kim file would be very big. here you can say that each image is to be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file impulse... select, will import & kphoto album; the exported database as described in written.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want, after that, in which file the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can personalize the category persons to the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is required for your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported in the third dialogue window and comply with what categories comply with these categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can get the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to search pictures and look at: when you look at pictures, you often want to watch out of different picture groups & mdash; if you are looking for example images of your Italy holiday and watch a picture with your friend to discover, you may want to see all the images that this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will receive the various steps of (1) fixed information on your pictures, via (2) the search and prestige, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">Photo album has been started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been expanded and today your videos. at many places in this manual will be talked about images, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; stores all its information in the index.xml in the top file of their pictures. this is an easy XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale securing tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; notices the folder, in which your pictures are stored and use this with future Starts automatically. if you want to read another folder with pictures, you can start & kphoto album; for example: photo album -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry (photo album) you can set up to a window with which you can change the settings of & photo album. in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call for a preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, you can install a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how to create different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labeling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete member groups, e.g. all members of a group on once in a group instead of all groups of a midtown.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings options available to you for fixed the membership groups. you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; divides his module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. nourishing information on this site you can find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & photo album; however, most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with several applications, it can be that the modules with & kphoto album are only very little tested. so you should use new modules first with the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userbox\ &gt; or via the menu help. do not say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI can be very different, so it can be that some modules with & photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you shares functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums: this kind of order does not support, it will simulate the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphoto album; the current album, which is just the current view, thus all the pictures you look at the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & photo album has to be handed over; the modules also has a list of albums. here's a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you've specified in the application dialog as category for virtual albums, for example, if you want to use the category people, will do & kphoto album; so do you want to add persons to view and give it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the module dialog, and select the modules, which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you start & kphoto album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the above one menu and tool bar. at the moment we see no information about your pictures. in the section we will not see any information about your pictures. in the section we will now click on this window, which shows you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphoto album; is the opportunity to view each image with notes on the image, where the image has been recorded. you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all images, Jesper and all the images were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsen as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In see three lists with a text box by setting up persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photo album; since you will always use them when you enter your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the list of images within the list. if you are depicted for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people can be found, so you can find the names mentioned above, find the persons faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting according to the list below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen notes for each image individually, you might need to edit all selected pictures and have these images with comments. Click in this case simply click the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all those pictures and use the menu button more than once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the United States. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as an overline. to show you, it is a special symbol displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the association dialogs it is possible to add a record to a existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also put an entry into a category and take this entry to this entry. attention, this is predicted that you just sort your categories of alphabetical order. see also.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the association dialogs to form, click and move the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window by drag him outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs to be satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also send a frame completely out. if you want to get this window again later, use the button options... and then click window a / out. this process will be shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will receive an overview with the pictures of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you do not have a filter. for example, you can see the size of thumbnails, by simply after pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it just times.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you have a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is decorated as background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this is displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window is created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and press either the remove button or select in menu Edit. now, you will see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures stored on the disk. of course you'll have to record the images somewhere, so you can download images from & kphoto album. in the picture you can see the view of & kphoto album; if not all required pictures of the hard drive can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut off, the pictures are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so you can view the preview of these pictures. however, you can view this pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, you need to copy files from the folders and to copy them again. if you don't want to avoid the insert of the right CD. if you want to avoid trouble, like the passage of your images, please buy a larger drive to store all the images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy you would like to stay in the end of those who want to see for others unaccessible and click all the pictures you can see your little sister, control and select the menu entry everything except for above view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Thus, you have set out what images are hidden in the case of the case. if you put the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry into your little sister. if you want to select the pictures you need to be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click to lock out.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to establish a password that must be entered for unlocking the pictures. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this image protection is not very safe. to one, you can read or delete any pictures on the disk and to the other can read the password as unencrypted text or delete it. this kind of password protection is only used to illustrate those who have with & photo album; not very familiar to resist the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & photo album; of course, and hours over hours therewith, of course, you want to consider them sometime. for this reason & photo album has a picture _ and video link. this can be seen from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the viewer. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all information you have on the image, such as who is on the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is shown on the upper part of the picture you can see this easy with the mouse, you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is shown. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. then you can see the context menu, you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, matching entries to this show. if you click Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several pictures in the viewer, you can easily switch between them and go back to jump the buttons image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as diaschau. & photo album; how often it can press a new image after a few seconds. as often it can press a new image by pressing the Ctrl button and plus or minus the buttons through the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of viewing & photo album; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can use in the picture and zoom out with the mouse. using the Minus button you can check out the plus button zoomt in the middle of the picture. it shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-button you can reset your zoom, so that the image will not be zoomed. with the balance links the zooms, so each pixel is equal to pixels of a picture of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work with videos that in and out zooming with the Plus- and Minustaste are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the context functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the actual picture with the menu note from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures you can pass a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. but you'll probably prefer to mark the image and look further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see what pictures you want to start with the pictures and see them as good or bad, while you're looking one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features, while you are viewing. features include the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters. in view, you'll see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have placed features on your pictures, you'll be able to print them in your browser. if you have all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>

<seg id="1013">In the object-tree you can select individual objects. then, their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model view.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously, but not the object's object already selected, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object-tree, select the position you want to insert the object and select either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>

<seg id="1023">The screenshot displays the camera control points. you can draw these control points with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling through the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual set. you can specify this value relative to the viewing level of the above object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level of smaller or equal to the scene chosen in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and view of the object properties will be displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window order, or if you need a different arrangement, you can also store multiple window orders and change between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To insert a window via or under a view, drag the text to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, head to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends across the total height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on each other, you prefer to change the text in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card bundles above in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchor, go to the top in mind or click on the small, pointing to the top right arrow.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the shape bar. to prevent the cupboard, click the small square between arrows and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are shamed, you can also anchor them in any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can store you with view window order... store. it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window order below an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering this program must be right installed. this version is written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renders the current scene, click the symbol Rendering The Symbol Rendering in the tool bar or select the menu entry in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s Ini files. it determines image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you may agree to many Render modes, from a quick preview of full pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render (in the tool bar or in the menu view Render modes...), the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name to detect the properties of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to rendering a small area of the picture, select the check box section and enter the image section to rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the User manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a painting with just one beam per pixel is enched, different errors may arise. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stuffed effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these mistakes. generally, pictures with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is further divided and adaptive because each pixel depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam of pixel. if the difference between the color values is checked, both pixels are calculated by tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you computes the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated on a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel will be shared into 4 subpixel size, which can be examined individually and further details. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the production of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn jittering, changing & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it takes a very long way to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object taken.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file impulse... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; yet not the complete command-range of & Povray;. when when importing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window shows a list of messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovvy; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from object-tree to the editor to import the source code for & Povray; it adds to the source file in the editor file. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source text editor and drag him to the object-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert into & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler is renders; usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in the Own view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. put here the path to your retention and version. supported the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimings) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you enter files, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for display of selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle of the viewpoint in the camera view and in the window-type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the catch-catch of points on the buttons in the context menu of the wire model-view. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give up a more precise wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can set the detail stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high accuracy for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided, when the camera uses an extended projection, all projections with exceptions are the perspective and vertical projections. this feature makes a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is placed behind the objects. the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a soil is enclosed below the objects. the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate canteen, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering scenes is used. the values for the depth and swelling can be set. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window frames will be explained, as you can create window orders and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard window order: displays all existing window frames. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window frames shows all existing window frames. a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear, and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views on the selected window order. new views can add and select select views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the available window, with unfolded, you'll receive a card bundle view together with the previous view and slipend. view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installs and now you want to follow without more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but easy to use: a ball at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider following warnings, before you complain about it that you can only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules for rendering can be applied as a result, you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert a light source, your whole scene is in the dark and you will just receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any faultless installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of toolbar. please read the documentation to get a reasonable presentation of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object-tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you create. in particular, note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now includes a new entry with the name camera. if they click on it, see the contents of the view object properties, in which the various parameters of the camera find. in user documentation on & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing at the basic settings of the camera, this is later reserved. but note that the camera can change in view of the camera, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on the left mouse button and drag him to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button application or the input, the wire model views and the object-tree immediately change this settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could set up a cube (insert endable body Quader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a reverse way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plain in object-tree, change the name and then press the button application or the input lines. in the object-tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the level even though at the moment only as limited data level. if you rendering the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object-tree, you'll notice that you can click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal line, just so you can meet some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select the floor only to set up its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog can be placed in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please choose the name in object-tree view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview you'll see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a mist black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities for the pigment. however, there are again many possibilities, but take the easiest way now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader and ball, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you rendering your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you have to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this once, but the chess board colour list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the object-tree jedesmal and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to run, as you have the basic working mode of & kpovmodelers; already understood. the ball is just as easy as the floor create:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the entry button or to push the button), so the ball has delayed contact with the ground. otherwise the ball would float above the floor, as you have moved the floor to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the Rendering is now a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears as a mist black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you select the ball, you can now prove a material now. as already in the bottom, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Dial the main object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. Click on ball pigment, then select disposable and put the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects, if you take the time to put some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness sheen effect and reflection result already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal are not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should have a good impression now, which possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully, you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you capture a scene, the Renderer hypothetical Rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources are reflected in the scene and as atmospheric effects as for example fog. so the scene is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye to see the scene. without a light source you can also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be gerated, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the Standard file dialog, you can select one file that you have with & kpovmodeler; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you'll need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Sets the scene again in the last stored version. all changes have been discarded since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry, if you are not yet stored in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeats the last backsliding command. you can only select this menu entry, if you use Edit properties.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialogue in which you enter a name for a new arrangement, or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting of & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the look, the keys and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can add to this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for the toolbars. you can add to this option tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a possibility to make rough surfaces, without any bending on the surface individually modeling and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometrical forms which you can use as a building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, using an image file as a colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& cozy show; is a comfortable image courtesy and browser. the application has a file browser which you can select pictures to display.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may also set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as & amarok; -short commands. thus make your keyboard to & amarok; control centre.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists, playlists and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function could be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & KDE. in addition, Amarok has some own command-sharing options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check your script as if all required modules are available and use it dialog, so the user reference why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Beginning of the 'Korundum' Rescue Error error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is Required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In folder scripts / templates, you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions. you will quickly find that the writing of scripts are relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amara and Amara. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; function is used. this way, dcop &gt; can be accessed relatively easily. here, an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; send notifications to all current scripts. for this reason, scripts will monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure. configure the script to display the setup dialog. if a script is started, Amarok sets the workfolder on the folder where all data are stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signals that a new piece is used. the script will now be & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume signalizes a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Custommenuclicked: submenu itemTitle: submitting the path to the selected files of playlist if a user-defined menu entry can also be used to remove the script to remove dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do for example storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed with bzip2 (.tar), which can also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 If only the script packages can be used with the extended amarocscript. from this reason you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar-parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and hang the link to the Viking scripts page of & amarok. you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio Player for & KDE;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can easily pull music into the playlist instead of moving through endless menus. maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's Collections browser and the quick-search will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if your choice is still difficult to select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs so installed (including the programs contained, because & amarok). we have written a small guide, such as Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD is predictable that your window manager will work for freedesktop.org, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to assist amaroK on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt because they provide excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can see this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and hang out the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of this is the fact that Taglib is part of reading the meta-information from this file system crashing. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, then you can try SQLite. support for it in & amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & amarok; with GCC 3.4, but TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then this means that the meta-information can be compiled.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable you automatically turn off when inactive for... in the setting of sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a common crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is the fact that many program write data as UTF-8 to meta-info, but this is not known as Unicode files. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the 'The $argv [0]; my $v2day [0]; my $v2day = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "error in writing the tags of $argv [0]\' unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2day ($v2day, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarocapp: cycapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixel .mapERK7Qpixel map, then please check if amaroK uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'ecamarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">In order to fix this error, you may need to remove any collidiating Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that amaroK will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are lightest among the help of experts your unix or Linux distribution. you can also seek help with other users or for developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please enter only one error, if there is something in the correction of an error in amaroK itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok, only a blank playlist appears. how do you come into musicels there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have created all & KDE; the program supports, supports & k3b; mainly two further parts are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; features such as copyCD, formatDVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef credible MovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject (), DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject (), DCOPCd (), DCOPCd (), DCOPDvd (), DCOPDvd (), DCOPDvd (), DCOPRef.</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can generate a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0). using this reference, it is possible to modify the project via using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference, it is possible to modify the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is applicable only on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Half createFolder (Qstring name, QString), PaddUrl (KURL url, QString-), Paddurl (Qstring path), renameItem (Qstring path, QString newname), setdefault ID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT CreateFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT pcop $PROJECT pcop $PROJECT pcop $PROJECT pcop $PROJECT case / foo / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audioily: is an audio CD; -reader for & KDE;. with him, you can read the audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder of the computer installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audioily: is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and from many encoders, which are supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (loss-free compression). other coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & coaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile yourself. but if FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary for example. if FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format should be used? the Chapters Kodierer is a small introduction about codiers, audio quality and compressive factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy of protected audio CD; s: as already said, it is not possible to crack the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to bypass any copy protection. if not the firmware of the CD; / DVD device is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid simply the purchase of Copier Audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration), the daily handling of a & CD is explained to the hard drive. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which body programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the FreeDb from the Internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of commands from the main window. on the page, step by step is more information, such as this program is used as well as screen photographs with descriptions of the tab for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the device on request in the CDDB register. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case first must be connected to the internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts out and - when an encoder is configured in the code tab at the setup tab - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available Encoder, so that the option can be read with another encoder as the standard. it is to be noted that before the Encoder has been configured in the tab setting settings.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so that an already selected file will be selected instead of a complete & CD; read and add.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the alignment dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, piepses) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog of & coaudioily; with different flashcards (such as encoder, for setup of the encoding). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes tonic quality, coefficients and compression rates, and helps you to choose the proper body.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is supposed to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey', possibly available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate the differences are less important because both codiaries are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High until very high sound quality (at high level rates), but compared with OGG easily deeper quality at deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play devices exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music can be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special Auto-stereo. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices are mostly supporting the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to the audio quality and of the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard' = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music by young people, portable devices and autodie-plants. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that entered manually or run by the program automatically from FreeDb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used to create file size and file names and the code of file names and the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codiaries, there is often a combination of program settings for the codiaries and these parameters here. the manual or help to the codiers declare the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) add to MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & coaudiothing; added. the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & coaudiothing; parameters which can be used (= button of a button in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: a free database, where people can download the audio CDs into the machine, so that all the other information can be downloaded from itself into the machine. it is to be noted that here only from text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Uebertus: that's the author) is not attorney. however, nobody can prevent from the & CD; more or less worthless, so you can neither do nor any artist nor the music company harm. any information can be obtained from a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audioily, it is active a check box. in this type of configuration, it seems to be used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used in the server (this can only know the programmers that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & audioily is set up; intended for use of FreeDb, the geographical nearest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflections for online delivery of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates on the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What kind of reading is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that to use cdparanoia; who wants to be more precise, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the exchangable WAV files, the code can be selected and thus the desired file format is selected. during the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab for the setup of the code. other codiers can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codiers package must be installed by the running linux distribution before the codiers can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codiers. more information on Kodiers are located in the chapter of Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodike, further information on its switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). there must be 'lame' by the name of the installed Kodian.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read-on of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc.), please try to enter both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might be something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you are not a copy-protected audio CD; you want to read. check the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, you can give it tips how to go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, everything understood, but somehow do not always understand what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, setting everything and read our first & CD; we will use 'lame' --preset extreme 'to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 flyers (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be installed cdparanoia and lame on your computer. both programs should be available as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not completely free software for example. in any case, it is not necessary to compile the source files you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to have it (eg; by copy to copy a copy).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section is the basic setup of & coaudiothing, something that probably will be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the presentation of a & CD; to be repeated for every purpose & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the codiers used to compression the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the FreeDb to download the & CD; data from the Internet download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings at any time, we probably do not change with any reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is delivered to the readers program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your run. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is possible, you can also find a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card of the card details. here is not much to do. here, an additional transformation is defined. in our example, everything will be displayed / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just ask for uncomplete information, so you will be informed if data are missing to the record of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card-card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and can download the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a FreeDb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: calculator must be connected during reading the & CD; connected to the Internet to access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, is a & CD; entry found, once you are unhappy with the database name / filename or tag entries, they can easily be changed with convex file name and file names and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter all the box and FreeDb is not used. however, this is about 620 MB large, you must be selected to use it twice. in order to select FreeDb in off-mode mode, you must be selected at least the first. the mode is set up on the following cardboard card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data inquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from FreeDb-Server via the Internet. how does the system know what data can get the CD? read the section about FreeDb. put everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we just want to work on the Internet server only.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org and check it out after a mirror server in your area. on this path, the load between the machines is distributed. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, but as many Firewalls uses the protocol 8880 standardly, maybe more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want & CD; transmit data to the FreeDb server. the first check box should be disable.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen photo. (make sure that the file / tmp is available on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same drive with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this on the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: if you can specify this file, then the file / file can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored. if the box is not crossed, the files will not be crossed in private folders. do not forget this folder if you want to make a bit with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything you enter as it is on screen photo. the command is a bit long, under circumstances, something must be stocked out to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">The number of WAV files at the same time: when a dual-core or square or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic setup of & coaudiothing; ends. this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, it is described as the process of reading the & CD; the file structure is described and set up. first, a connection to the internet is organized, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from the FreeDb will pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each purpose & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; the screen photos are not contained in FreeDb, see the screen photos a little different than the one & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually enter instead of taking them from the internet. comments are to be found on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD now must be inserted into the drive which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD can be picked up successfully by FreeDb, all tracks are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; you will select a window, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD; fits perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings) you can also solve this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have local database, you need to get the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'topical title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the 'topical title', unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments of iniquities per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which are valid for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from FreeDb, the CD editor is not blank, but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor, so that you do not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the comment area. if you have ID3v2 tags, this option is set up at the tab at the tab. throw a look at the section 'basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see in the help of the Kodizer to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, obviously with the style of the permitted CD; this example is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; -data anyway. for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors will be back and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the listed data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information that you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected on the line. a simple click on the line switches the selection of each piece or select the button All pieces select the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selecting the reading process, this window appears on confirmation. OK, and then we'll see a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you are trying to work with a code which you haven't yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the client list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target file are not what we have entered here in an example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, read and coding parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is improved now.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings found to read this behavior. the only one thing seems to be configurable is the result of parallel. the used machine with a amd64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order in the queue at the queue. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & coaudioily;, you need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& coaudiofer; today, you can download an anonymous copy as part of the costing media package. however, you can download an anonymous copy. most distributions, however, can already be an exemplary copy of your distribution. if you read this package you have already done this package from your distribution. if you read this, you probably have done it already...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons that compile the source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help with the program your needs can be adjusted once, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls out many different programs, has many variations on settings. at the best you can read the step for step example to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of the different flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, always read on? even if only the help menu after the first-time frame of the program was clicked, without any reference point as it is to pass from this somehow empty screen from (especially if there is no audio CD; on the drive), or from the unusual short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">Why is it? who reads this, probably started the program already. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't keep this manual. it is as the first version for a manual and audiothing. if you also want to add something useful or change, let it do. at least only after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has understood this section and therefore agree with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if it has managed to get the source file from & KDE; SVN, then you don't need this information, but...</seg>

<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and install the button in the tool bar, select the entry pick-up from the menu or run the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you draw it to the & kmid; windows. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any site by using the middle mouse button and drive away with the regulator and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song becomes too fast or to slow down, you can change to the arrows at the left and to the right of the template. to get the speed speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry pause in the menu, interrupts the playback. plugging the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events are expected and even better: the event type is automatically determined that you have to adjust nothing manually. if so, in the menu settings, you will need to adjust nothing manually, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the menu settings the entries text events or property events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are the series to be played after. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To place a collection, first open the collection manager. this is located in the menu collection under the point. Click here on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then add the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set up the desired format option.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. concerns it if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by adding a song. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the automation automation collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection (using File, or drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removal.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which songs are played off. if you select the series after the submenu sequence of the menus collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu, the order will be set.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, record next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to jump back a song, select the button previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the delete collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be extinguished. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not stored on leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favourite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section can only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. the requirement for this is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... End Define KEYMAP "Another Keymap"... End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map-file as an email, so that I in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI is displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you must not change the order and no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now an MIDI-file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (riflation) it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Trouble patch of the patch is meant when each tone is a different percussioning instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone the pitch of the same drum means (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are depicted on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like in the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you must only use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to cover sounds onto the Perctee channel. check out as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, make it simply in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the corresponding Keymap is to be used again in front of the file! if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the Perctee patch on the Perctee channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio will be multiplied, in which ratio of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to have no decimal place in the Map-file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM suggest that there is a keyboard that is supposed to be a pitch benchmark with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards up to one octave higher. in order to find the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the MIDI settings dialog. this can be found in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole number of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these claviatures, you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a instrument, the button doesn't appear green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view the Settings menu below the point of canalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">An MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so it can result in two different devices at very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes on a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. in an MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you compiled a binding (rpm, deb) of & kmid; it has happened because & kmid; without AWE support, you have to download and install a source code (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & dequeror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, you can absolutely automatically activate the collection automation collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can double the arrow keys from the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on one & KDE; -Desktop a & Connectivity; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this Desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, merely go to the & Conqueror; Windows and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen quickly a file, without adding them to a collection, turn off the automation automation to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you want to play the first file. so, set the setting automation to the collection and open A.C. Your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join us, also B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all many thanks! if I listen to these songs or postcard, animate me that, continue to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga.

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write to me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge anticipation if you send me a postcard from your residence or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or an MIDI file, then I will record a MIDI file, but you should contact me when I've got the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and from no emancipation for money. I like therefore emphasize that I will only do more information because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File security: in this mode the DVI; -file is connected to the output of the complex and there is no call from & eyepiece; after high-speed.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In consideration of the editing tool bar, the three large selection of selection sectors should be developed into the document. the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The simplified & latex; -commands for the division are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field is further for insertion of articles such as keywords, fusions, notes, or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Designation: with this command, a name for one section, an image or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed name (selection of a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & BibTex; this only works if the file is needed to create a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & BibTex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand written.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The final selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for the creation of the font. it can be defined as scripted instructions for the main text, the joints, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection criteria are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and legend of the settings. 2. the document can be written by the bottom of the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font color. it is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; source code compiled. the simplest way to this is the use of the volume building or the button of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. & kile; storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document should be searched for the errors. when using quick construction should & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (english. environment) is a text which is different from the other document. for example, a report with the font size should have been created. the command\\ reference {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} encourages the possibility of written down within the area of the area of the "Outside Huge" (English Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the area only within the environment (from\\ to {environment} to\\ end {environment}), there is no limitations (number) for the changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fatty printing, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands are either added to the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ The {emph}: this command is available for the cursive pressure and is long as long as it is closed, until it is closed with a\\ '{emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be presented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ '{quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; evaluation language is displayed, then follows a step-to-step instructions for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit text was entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be accomplished. for example, mind. a quote, a few places in fat and short printing and a poem to the application are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be turned into the editor by editor-view or Ctrl E (at the internal viewer). at an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to one & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a non-dependent file format (engl. D e V ice I n.2). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for reading of some drivers on the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converting or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after the click on DVI - you can then print the document using file printing (in the viewer, if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar conversion the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion can begin to change other formats using the button PFE in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search encourages direct jump from the editor to the two-door position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. only Modern under settings can be set up... tools to be used.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To select the preliminary search, the mouse indicator has to be positioned in a line of source textubing and close to preliminary search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer is soaked.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece, one click on the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; used and related to the corresponding line. to this one must be specified as text editor (Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick-structure of the & DVI; the viewer can not be used, a mistake may lie. if an error occurs, this will appear in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file is the source of error in the source code. the logging file always gives the line to the error in which the error appears. to look at the wrong column, must be clicked on the error in the logging, navigating immediately to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you clicked on the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose from the presentation template for the document. the pre-provided toll are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can be written either of the reason or the assistant to create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates are made in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new model, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; -file to create or create a new file. & kile; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file template file... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">In creating a new document using a file, new character strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">In creating the own template, it is necessary to know which character strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by the input in document class. typically it is used as such as:\\ Close [$$DOCUMENTCLASSPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to creating a template is the use of the wizard and that is associated with the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, its own template may be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files can be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers of reading and herejection of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate; can be done directly in the menu tools directly from & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his enthusiasm should learn the manual to Kate. users of & kile; go directly with reading the chapter by & Kate's work.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be called for the LaTeX reference. you will reveal an evaluation description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with press Ctrl key to run the & tex; this means that in this way, in the click\\ par\\ bigskip\\\ par\\ bigskip\\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with drilled linker mouse, the selected text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, you can fully select parts of the source code in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; the possibility to browse the wide variety of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants invites you to create an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu brand or the corresponding key stamp is emphasized, so that this jumps is also highlighted in the first input of a character automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & kile; although & Kate; important functions for writing a & latex; source code for the writing of a & latex; source code for their selection. under editing the following commands are contained to the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">When a complete paragraph consists of (group of lines that contained on both sides an empty row). this extended meaning is not given to tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventative thing in & kile, is that the shutdown are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">When the word is below the current Cursorter, this selection has also an extended meaning, since this command is also & latex; -commands with a separate star (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To make a part of a part of the document, this first can be removed and removed by pressing the key. & Kate; offers its own commands here. & kile; offers the following commands for a faster user. under editing, the following commands are contained in the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a section in & kile; is included in the description of editing descriptions.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further orders under operating environment for one mely simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, the current environment is speckled (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor before or within the command\\ of {surroundings} is located at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of shifted environment commands it can quickly be lost. this command close the last modified environment, so that the scrap structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also special commands for the & latex; -groups that are determined by staples {...}. under Been TeX Group are a few important commands, which correspond to those working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, the current group starts (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the closed clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, the current group runs (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the soaked clamp of a & tex; group # is, the other end of the group is speckled (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">With the input of many welded groups brackets you can perish quickly. this command close the last modified group, so that the scrap structure of the & tex; -groups is not distorted.</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users are able to arrange the columns in tables and all the Et characters (amp;) to each other. if this tabulator is not to be encouraged in the daring line. although this tabulator is not being added, it is added to the column position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate is already a good source code, it was added in & kile; in order to include special commands (usually available for & latex;) three to need and the other two are available for different working settings. all these modes are set for different working settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When you start a new environment with the command\\ of {environment} & kile; automatically added the command\\ end {environment} after an empty row (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the selection, the last character of the input will be removed and completely deemed by the fulfillment list. on the other hand, the list can be reduced by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be submitted to the selection of a command. alternatively, jump to these positions, so that simply jump to these positions by editing the blacks of sprinting stamp, and the mixed parameters will then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Among settings are able to set up... kile; fulfilable settings to these lists are made. they may be able to choose different ways of bets for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as Wabs of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is to be entered for the completion of environments. on the other hand, the environments will always be entered into a few letters with\\. on the other hand, environments become so often used that & kile; a special mode for the completion of environments is used.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling for the completion mode, the order entry is automatically sorted and it appears\\ of {s). after that, the ambient sound will continue in the simplest way and will be continued in the simplest way through the input of input.</seg>

<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Starte the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the leaves for requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to the server to address a Debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points the debugger to start with the execution of the script and the current line on the oversaw variables as well as the current line up. if this happens while the script is started, the execution will be resumed, the script begins with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without information about supervised variables and the current line number. if this is done, the execution continues. if this is done, the execution date is given, the execution starting as soon as a request is provided.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or CSS; and TagXML files are handmade, symbolic bodies of image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions can insert faster into a document than a user.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be built-in (see below), downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DTD. see details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to create, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuresc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. toolbars enable a quick insertion of tags in a document without any risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing as folders. they only contain the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the describable language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible to make other users a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all about the possibilities and limits is provided in simple manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains only one element type about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tags is a script function. when using is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the type Method. gives the name of the class to where this method belongs. (Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. that is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. in addition, it contains the name and type of attribute. in addition, it contains further tags to describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Is the source used for filling the source used for the attributes in the tag editor and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires resource = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantum lus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires resource = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodname within & quantum system; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires resource = dcop, a cut-section and a methodology. the arguments that are handed over to the method. can be empty or% dayname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list together. it can only occur for an attribute description only once. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of any tags within a dialogue. this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be available for every field in dialogue (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the defining tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; Declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog above in the & quantitlus; window to start and checking TagXML. to choose. another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is not available yet. currently, the audit is carried out only by the store of the TagXML files in & quantum;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this day XML file is to be Schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; drawer function is described. the file name of this day XML file is supposed to be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be handled via DTD edit DTD settings; with editing a & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = users 1 for & quantum; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name as nickname is used.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A promotion can set up actions with settings... created. Click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button of this promotion is defined. by clicking the User button, a button should be assigned; with Kone the current keystanders can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the Detailiated settings and inserted in the document the document will be inserted at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications can change or use as input (or parts of document). examples of & quantitlus; even are the quick start -dialog or the various see... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% script.shanta / scripts local script file: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaces the current document's URL. in case of a local document, file will be removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantum system; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantum system; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script executes can be received from & quantum; at the default input. in the box input, input can be determined, which is to be send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected document of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to input, the output of the listed application can also be implemented. there are two types of issue: normal edition, written on the default issue; error messages, on the default issue. it can be specified, which will be set to the default output by default:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create an own tool bar. in the case it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day attributes, and you plan to use their use, activate dialog "Day" when available, so that a input will be possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignorant! is that a domestic symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating an symbol that the promotion is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & drop menu;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all the other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually regarded as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should be signaled down to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; ready to insert the tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it must still be linked to the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantum lus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Choose the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue using other tags, so there are still which are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitlus; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be divided to a better overview by some trdenominator in several groups. open the toolbars on settings toolbars. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (top left) for my tool bar. after the choice of the element, which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow keys to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to add a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & Conqueror; button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by tasting of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save in the correct file. after reeXML does not exist, it will be impedigreed, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is open from the appropriate folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantitlus; for normal users the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language, which you like to like. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; -document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantum; -Repository whether someone has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we leave you, the second part we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in main index Top element = Sec2.html Section 2 = Sec2.html Section 2 = Sec2.html-2 = func2.html-2 = func2.html-2 = tag2.html-2 = tag2.html-3 = tag2.html-3 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Section.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = a age.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents file is referenced directly to a file (and consequently the upper end of the tree view & mdash; file is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative;</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the area of the docrc file, which is to be displayed as writing a & PHP; scripts the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressures of Ctrl; H for context-aid would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file distribution lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of different context-related context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply store your docrc file and save $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc / apps / quanta / doc / apps for local or global use. then create a folder (as you have this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copying your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it, please send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantum; -Repository for the use by the & quantum; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have been involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative lus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the remaining resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send an email to friends, partners or else to whom. in different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantitative users can download it. the contributions will be checked and only available for publication. in order to make a useful contribution, we recommend that there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is ensured, both for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are required according to their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event you have to pass one. in the dialog new resource you must remain empty (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the uploading can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can also upload the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload toolbar, and will begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, examines & quantitlus; the authenticity of the resource is warning and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears, stating the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML-languages which is currently not supported by & quantitlus; but it can be used simultaneously, because hundreds of day files could be necessary in day XML format. there is the easier way to convert DTD to a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">Converting from the DTD store and convert a DTD menu. select the .dd file with DTD description, which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination name: newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition: the string that appear in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd should be released</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantum; according to conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitlus, there are some key concepts. to understand these fundamental concepts and quantitative benefits. this chapter one has to bring about these fundamental concepts to them, without their understanding and quantitlus; little use would increase.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitlus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantum;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantum; use, available in common folder structure of & quantitlus; saved. this allows the Group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and samples in the global tree that will then be available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items provide a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be done with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees inside the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative system; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the builders, the carteivers with information and the toolbars. please turn in, and for further information regarding these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the flashcards with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current doctrine, reload, delete or upload the document, jump or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click menu in the Editorarea lead to another context menu regarding the processed documentation (copying / copying / paste / paste / inserting), editing of the mouse pointer, or opening the file below the mouse pointer, or opening the file below the mouse pointer to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the Editors are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantum; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as standard for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantum; the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and thus linked user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really light. if they want to insert a simple day, for example, & lt; then click on the symbol that the day represents, then you can insert the data for this just one day. if they want to insert several attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The supervision of construction (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information & quantitlus; to navigate them to open and cross-strips. in the presentation of flashcards are available for files, project, sample positions, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building devices.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantum tool; this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project using correct mouse click. actions like adding, removing, upload or delete files from the storage media can be performed with the console menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitlus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, all web site & etc. there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be subdivided into three categories, depending on what connection it is used. the category depends on & quantum; the working range are always available, local templates are only usable for the appropriate users and templates in projects only in the project. more to templates are found.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts in the Global, Local and Project here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, further functions can start to edit, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by links to one element, the cursor is set on the position of the element. by right-click of a element, a list of commands in terms of navigation and refusal of the tree is opened.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other devices. with it can change sorting and namespaces, which allows you to change the content of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. it can be downloaded from quantitative documentation for & quantum; it can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc into a project can create project-specific documentation, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitlus; two carteionites at the lower end of the window can be reached via the usable information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton shows information about each in Quanta current script. for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes on DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantum lus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantum tool; toolbars are extensively developed and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the chocolate making of the toolbars is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in & quantum; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantitlus; is the ability to send an toolbar with an email. & quantum; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can secure them in & quantum; how to secure and load any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantum; -files on your system. for this, Autoconf might get a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with the stems of & quantum; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH is located in front of their bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative lus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative complex; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While effort to create the best & HTML; editing the developers of & quantum; what would be when & quantum; a standalone, extendable markup language editor would like? well, this would make it an absolutely fantastic web development tool for & KDE. so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitlus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then the appropriate & IDE; for that, the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be noted that & quantum; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; the company is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; it is not only possible to expand this, but it allows users and developers, & quantitlus; to extend how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative monitors; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can enhance productivity almost every task. by the program Komi, they can expand & quantum; without any scripting scripting-language support must be noted. (more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for rapid development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL censored version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of this documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & dequeror; enter or inhelpcentre help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta has been developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras MANTIA amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time if you open a file, which is not on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and entire files as templates for the later use. check in the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project pre-level file, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there included special characters to & HTML, preventing them correctly and not be understood by the browser as formatting assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -appelling, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s in the anchor day uses.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch the block selection to or out. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key; please select.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go straight to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searching for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or used with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not on. that's the window, in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Spin and Switching of the problem reporters at the lower edge of the & quantum system; the problem journalist is activated once you move to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar left from the main window. this column allows you to set the Bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will be previous in the menu together with entries or next, depending on the position of cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped after filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantitative complex; -projects are saved with file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that enables to copy graphics files into your project folder, or a sub-folder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded any additional input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantitative lus; the project manages. in Chapter & quantum; -projects you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project tool bar. these are kept in project management / toolbars and are only in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. it creates only the name. actions must be saved by settings actions. toolbars will be saved via toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the visible area. this deletes it not from the hard drive. if you don't have saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Thus, you can send your own tool bar to someone (perhaps to the & quantum; -team, so that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu option opens up a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where any other can access them. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; you or any other made and convert them to the & quantum system; own PA format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Charging / stimulants from the & DTD; it is sensible if the entities from the & DTEP is to renew without the whole & DTEP. if this is global and write permission in the global KDE folder, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag dialog, when there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantitative inserts; the insertion by tool bar is refusing if this day is contradicted to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the top of the menu points. please click. click on a activated plug-in disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the current file value for the current file. the list of available hernization schemata depends on the same; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external use tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate change between different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause or cause unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card mode, which is also the default setting, or the bottom line mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantitlus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu for each open underwindow contains one entry. with a selection of entry, the appropriate lower window is activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantum; main fensters.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog can be used in any application that use the HTML-part, including the & counter web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judging the behavior of editing a. in documentation of & Kate; you will find detailed information.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbars, add which you can change and follow the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in the environment's environment, but it is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative lus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free to use, but as with every open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantum; -development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top of the project, for example, after filling the project name, all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantum; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. footh.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine to which one wants to access local data. either a name (hostname.examples .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you use this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocols are used. depending on the remote computer setting, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars will be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you can download and change. at serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you need to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Note, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will not be involved. if a project is started anew, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to vouchers.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by clicking or by removing the skins, out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can be upload in the menu with Project Properties in the menu profile, or upload with the button Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in detail. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder is possible) to re-read for projects such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">With this, the desired Debugger can be selected. currently, Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be set in. the debugger plug-in can be set with the button options. in this, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom-window profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the advertisement for the content of the server for each profile by showing a separate building services for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the lower window configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the lower window configuration, one can change event actions and add these actions, change or delete the actions. event transactions are executed if a certain event occurs, such as the sicknesses of a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default & quantum lus opens; the last project which was opened. this behavior can currently not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project open... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantum lus is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving, if & quantitative files are changed. the same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management provides free access to the files in the project. the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open to open... in the context of the right mouse-up menu menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be chosen here. the profile contains information about the place of high-allowable files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows for removing the current profile. if there is only one profile there, the button is blinded to prevent removing removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is reserved in the core memory and forget about programming. this option is useful if frequent uploading files is necessary and the rather insecure password stored on the disk option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitlus; many high-load profiles have been created and so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creation of a profile, this dialog will display:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that will be copied onto the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. list depends on the version of & KDE; and installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS can choose.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service not to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. if your password is stored on the plate, so it can't be read on the plate, but everyone with programming language can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. by simply exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the project or the project tool bar, available via settings toolbars project tool bar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantum lus, with which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantum; to your own workings.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantitlus; best through the menu toolbars can be stackable. use and add. adding tool bars will be treated below in the section of adding toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set to adjust either via context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can be executed, tool bar rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog, where actions can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a tool bar, in addition the entries must remove and processed action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and set settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentaries, code snips and files to link. you can copy, postpone or any existing file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move one or any of the existing directory in the pre-level file. templates have in & quantitlus; in about the restrictions you can set up for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitlus; included templates have conditions for their applications. please read the conditions before using any template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents by linking (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the pre-level file under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple report for the purpose and organises work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the pre-level file under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a presentation but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final score to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the pre-level file under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are serving as templates. they are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there is no examples in & quantitlus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure to popularity (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and save file as a template as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it has been saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the Project tree. look at the pre-tree in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as a template to store selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be dragged along with pulling and arrange on the building view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy in a pre-file folder. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and insert or inserting on the file-tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can choose a folder in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, the project folder is secured, but of course it can be saved as local or global presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project plans permit a very target-oriented approach. you can set headlines and footer or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link with them. in addition, you can retain some things using templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files in the $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / editing / apps / quanta / editing / apps / quanta / editing / apps / quanta / editing templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as stated above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder is in the level of file, click on the folder and select the context menu properties below. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A radio box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled, as soon as elteral attributes is disguised.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except for the stem-folders. if a stem-folder would be disable, unless they would be explicitly activated. in case of normal folder, the Blah would appear with something like text-builders. if nothing appears, one is probably in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allow you to set previous or set text for templates in this folder. this might be general headlines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special headlines / footer a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footer lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you will feature context menu (shown on the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative system; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source editor, which are available via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source editor through the VPL; -Editor and the second divides the editing window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and when needed to edit the source code Editor, in which the changes in the VPL file format are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor at a document that includes & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; edit & PHP; there is no plans to change these behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that, at the same time, the cursor in the source editor and the VPL; -editor synchronously runs. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, this mode is already active in the active cursor from a window to another, whereby the position is kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. if you choose from synchronization after a click or automatically. in general, the recommendation is set to be adjusted. basically applies the recommendation: a small pot for fast computers and a great span for slow PC.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose the title of unvisible tags in working with the VPL; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; -Editor is created. this allows you to change the hash of hash.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document themselves, e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list enables the change of the content, such as key words on the column names and keyword substituted 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the design of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the list below the list or delete. a change on the list is possible as with the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules are currently not supported.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had corrected many changes and corrected the submission to many places. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clues to the places where perhaps only the objection had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences in one line and modifications to white signs. later, many further useful features have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare the text quickly, copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function related & kdiff3; almost into a fully-known file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two people can work independently of one piece of code and make modifications at the same time. in this editor you can even edit the outcome. in this editor, you can even edit the results directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you get the same and merge folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; with folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the precise differences and adapts to the possibilities of current color monitors. if you need to check code often, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are shown visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see it at a glance at the column in the column at the left side. (no anger more if any one changes the return.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates that the file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify the Tippwork by scanning the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse folder and diffuse folder in diffuse folder, diffuse folder in diffuse folder, diffuse folder in diffuse folder, diffuse folder in diffuse folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual setting of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or select a last opened file from the list. the opening dialog will give you a third file again. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be done.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Above the button... you can also select one folder. if you choose a folder, the comparing or merge file will be introduced, for B and C, however, use a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging crosses, the input field is active for the target and process it. however, it is not necessarily required to determine immediately an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button gives a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text compare. & kdiff3; allows you to pull text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison of opening dialog must not select any files, you can easily connect the dialog using the button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and use: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from a editor and let it fall on a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes it contains a file for e.g. several similar functions. if you need to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to upload and compare it into & diff3; and now you can simply copy the relevant sections and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment, you can't pull out anything from & kdiff3; only the changes of text into a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some Editors interpret the goat and insert text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line of the source code contains the character A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that windows C is optional). (if the path has to rest for a bit, let the mouse will rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source code contains the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one can see on the color which file differs. if both files are distinguished, the default color is red for it. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left alongside the text is the merge column. when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (C / C + + e.g., white signs are only relevant in strings and commentaries, for the processor and in a few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column of the text, is interrupted by the digits, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison list) also has a information line with the inscription issue:, the filenames and [change] if you have edited the result. usually it contains the automatic merging already text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, the Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to the next dissolved / unrest conflict to find out the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, any difference is also to be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Through one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows selected, the first line of group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this group will also be displayed at the beginning of the group). this group will then be emphasized with the color background colour for current area and on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merging or manual mode, no further line remains in the group; then it is only a placeholder for the case that you might change your opinion, and maybe select another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert it differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; matching conversion flow; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the sources the options ignore or use Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the image processing and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can also use the arrow keys to the right, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. you can also click here to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye-window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with insert button, you can switch between insertion and transfer mode. (default is the insert mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button to synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already stated in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture backwards / Strg-picture downhill) or to the next / former conflict (Ctrl-picture downhill) or to the next / former conflict. therefore, it must be regarded as a conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unresolved conflict must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertion). if this option is enabled, automatically copy to the clipboard and copy copying copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line-in-feed\, and Win32-based systems use the line of the source files\\ r\. Kdiff3 retains the line of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be stored automatically and restored to the next start. (menu entry equipment - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a typeface with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides a variable width of variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic writing. if the chosen typeface does not support this presentation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be rendered astert. on these systems the button settings are automatically an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, when pressing the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you enter or return, the reset line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manually copy the way to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select what Zeiling type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While comparing files tries & kdiff3; first to find all complete identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white signs are not ignored. also, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a vehicle-line '\' at the end of a row, others again save a Zeileneck '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; however, if this option is activated, but then you could be disabled with different sizes. during the merging, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignores. in the outcome, the differences are still displayed, but they will be treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively search for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next ungeldest conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves auto all conflicts in white signs by the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) That is useful if white signs are less important in many files. if you have this only from time to time, use conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignoring or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and merging a merging. look for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, then the original version is the Suffix .original file. if already such a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. this option does not affect the current running program. you need to finish and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you use this option, the default setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection areas for the coding, a short notice appears what is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influenced how special characters can be treated and interpreted. as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which code should be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define prefabrication commands, they might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files might handle 16 bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can define the coding of the edition of pre-fabrication commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off in order to suppress heredations of changes in text or visions. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a colour-coded survival column are indicated. according to selecting from A & lt; B, A & lt; C; C or B & lt; C; C is displayed next to the normal additional transitional column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. just feel the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the same window by side or overlap. this may also be useful for display of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together, then if you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and use the file name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that fits exactly your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut out parts or to correct use.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given to the external command first. if a normal pre-processing command is given (see above), then the command of command is used only when the line is used. you can write your own preprocessor that fits your own processor. each input line needs to have an appropriate issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, there is an external program needed, and most users want to program it. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this prefabrication command to convert the input into major letters: SED'S /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's found in the found text in upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another prefabrication command for Zeilenab. sed "s / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character set between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each showing will be replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform some impressions at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the translations between each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use something different such as perl -p -E's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerdings are different from perl some details. where used\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to normal preprocessor will maintain for display and merging. further operations simply change the data that sees the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-processor will see the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. from this reason, you can compare and assemble complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal to merge; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes, without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... lead selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparing and merge of individual files. you need to open only folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders can be merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target file specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merging. to select the merge, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the inreading of the folder you can inform a little news window about current progress. if you start scanning the file, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder was found during scan, displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can click on the + / - click, or to double the arrow keys for the left / right. the menu-menu contains two functions, flaps and collect all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these guys are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action is not automatically selected. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when its total content is identical. then also folder the same color. when folders is the age unequal to its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g., if A folder and B one file is): error: conflicting data types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (such as A folder and B one file is): error: conflicting data types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronise is active when only two folder and no explicit target file specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then chooses & kdiff3; the necessary promotion will be identical to the file. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merging and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after merging copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be combined and the option of new file instead of merge (unsafe), then examines & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. soles such mistakes can not be eliminated, the merging of the folder may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merging you will have a file after the other. it status column displays Fertig, if the merge is successful, and according to other messages, if something is expected, you should make a final review and see if the status is fine everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in alignment dialog, the file comparative method is chosen, KDiff3 further columns indicate. these contain the number of unconscious, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have any target file, then in the three-folder merging mode C, B is used as the target, when the two-file merge is selected and used for synchronizing A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target file, please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target file, even in the folder structure. there are some options to skipped the specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring together all entries: select Directory Settings / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the Tasting button) to put together only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exists invalid actions, a message appears on the erroneous elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you put together all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options, simulating and break out.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose simulating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a full list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge to a single file), then a merge window (see screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select another directory to start / continue or press F7. if you don't have saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; his work with the next post continues.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on one error, there's a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you may want to try to skip the problem of any problem. if you choose to choose the problem, or make the problem to resolve the problem or solve the problem in any way before you proceed with the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually operated, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and lead them together at the later session. even if the merge is overloaded, these entries are considered active. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called Directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree. there can be several patterns. put the pattern with a Semikolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). folders must not comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be entered in elementary tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be entered in elementary tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder is specific with a .cvsignal file. (see under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files are selected attribute. in other file systems you have marked a previous point. this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In case of links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic lins are compared. if the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links like normal files will be treated and recursive. (note that a link to a folder should lead to a final shift, & kdiff3; crashes off.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file by and shows statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unequal, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (specify an appropriate Anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder on a slow network, it may possibly be faster, only changing the date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change, there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when copying the date of date. please use caution. please use caution. this option is available in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target file specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are identical. also the results of merge files are stored in both folder. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the copy of the newer file is proposed as action. (this will be considered unsafe, because it is believed that the other file has not been changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced or deleted, the original version is renamed, and receives the extension .original. if an old backup file is already deleted, this will also be deleted without additional backup. this also applies to normal merge individual files, not only the merging whole folder. this option is switched on the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders merge list is visible to the merging single files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the / text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file simply using double-click. yet, in the directory menu, you can also use a single file directly, without only the folder command to run. as soon as you save the result, the status will be dealt with and the file will not run once again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be differentiated if a link indicates a file or folder. then it will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit missions or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change of change of change from the original. (note the option of trust in size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as the differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts to start the built-in differences. in order to launch KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a piece, it takes & kdiff3; the file name of the original files from the patch file. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch begins to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. also, please note that this does not work if no of the original files exists. also, this is unreliable when the original files has changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or the comparisons of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now heist) exist already. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 out of the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot, I looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources compiled and the configure script probably not the correct PREFIX to KDE. in default, KDE can not find resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). you can find more information about this topic in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are identical as the same; but if only a non-white character is different, the line will not be identical as not identical. iF similar lines from next to Each other, this Pis, but this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor sign up for any difference in the files where he starts and where he is ending. however, this important information is lost, however, if the result is simply saved as text file, and it's too much effort to design an extra file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can always use a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly; no src left; appeared and the text does not extinguish. what does this and how can that be removed?</seg>

<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or switch-switch) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or switch-switch) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all files are not appear in the folder structure, and therefore does not appear in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you will need to re-read these options on these options with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are indicated that identical files will not already be copied into the target folder. if the target file does not contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior is likely to change in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group. if the lines are already available, they will be removed from the button on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. underslide in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniatures of all virtual workplace. it is quite practical to view the current programs on the working areas to change their size, to end or move it. it works both within a desktop as well as with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual work areas, as well as those in the current applications. the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows within & pager can be moved. the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when on the empty hole of & Kpager; clicked on, the context menu and the name of application as well as entries minimize, maximize, in desktop and end. the commands effect the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of mind. it appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. it appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the medium mouse button on the desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, will appear in the & Kpcamp; the names of virtual workplace are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field makes the & Kpager. view the numbers of virtual work areas. it is crossed along with name, the names are provided with ordained figures, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background is also displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only the empty workareas are displayed in order to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here's the view of the program window. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program layout. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main windows are determined: traditionally known as Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal, shows all virtual work areas in a horizontal and vertical range, which is very good for displaying the sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniprogram in the Control Panel. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with their contents. moreover he runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and follow the switch off switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can't be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do it manually:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; stimulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse poise a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people to emulate pain on the repetitive operation (RSI) syndrome, and can emulate the mouse using the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that leads to the mouse to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also depend on pain associated with the use of your computer, you should search for a doctor if this is still not done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clearer again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid pain when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that applies due to the mouse, useless. and, as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be adjusted for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you break the movement short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shifting enabled, makes & kmousetool; a break after it is executed by pressing the mouse button. in this way, you can run the mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This failure must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the set time shift shifts (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool, before the mouse button is waiting again, when the mouse button will release again if no problem is done for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now, this function is enabled, followed by a break, followed by a break, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. a slow drop to the right and returns a double click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can reduce the response time, you can add the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the rider. there is a slberegler sound buffer, which you adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this attitude is marked, & kmousetool; started with each start of & KDE; now, this function is currently under & KDE; please go to the respective documentation to find out how to automatically launch a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all the settings back to the values that when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button application, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the default settings. in particular, intelligent shifting should be turned off first. if you then click to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & KDE; at sounds too.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places is a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on jobs in the browser window, which doesn't represent an Link, does not lead to unintentional reactions. you can therefore park the mouse to such positions until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is ruckelt, you should clean your mouse. it is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all, you have to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, mouse is different from mouse. it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball removed, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can scratch easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are going to use the intelligent shifting, this means that & kmousetool; the operation doesn't stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem consists in it that you do yourself a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to perform mouse click and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the Cursor to place where you want to make him. but parked the mouse on a neutral area of mind, if you encounter any key mouse click unintentional reactions. safe zones for the mouse pods are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the cover lines from windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shifting, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is a more advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you get to copy it into the clipboard or move to any other promotion, when you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse button. however, there will probably be some problems with them. here are some advice on it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use intelligent shifting, if you just start using & kmousetool; to use. mark Text instead of writing a mouse button and hold the switch button, while you move the mouse pods to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is done every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button pressing a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent shifting, even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be installed on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; actuated the mouse poste once the mouse poignant. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and which the mouse pooping pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins, before the mouse button is released. in this way, pulling and locking with the mouse can be done.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the references of filtering, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen reagents has the highest priority. it will be preceded to all other orders and holds these orders. if the issue of screen Reader is read, the orders will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has precedence and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web site can be read with & kmouth; someone welcome you just enter the room. & KDE; -Notations are also news. read on.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order that you get from the card card orders is a text job. KSayit is an example of applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which have no special pressures.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen-Readers, while & dictts; just such an reads, this issue will hold and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reagents. they are applied to normal warnings, messages, text orders and on & KDE; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and add it to the next filter. at the time there are three kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future, there can be more kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character chain tensioner replace parts of a text by other text. it is supplied with predefined strings chain filters, which can be used with pre-defined strings chain hardware, such as: -) through text or for the formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -transducers use a XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) um & XML; provided by a format into another format. in delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are contained in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker systems, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that send the text to & ktops, send to a speaker. if you have set a female voice, you can read text from KDE messages about this. sieve about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for a language output. if the filter is fixed, it does not apply the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text contract, a message, warning or a & KDE; notification on & ktops; sent to them by all activated filters, which were set up in the page below. editing the filter is performed in the order in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This displays the list of incoming normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated, and is not used. filters will be removed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following entries are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the establishment of character chain filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative pattern. these patterns are exchanged in text, then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text. large and small-mail will not be considered compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filters. you can choose this name, it must only distinguish between the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column, and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is shown in the shown order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can upload a list of words or regular expressions to store the current list or delete a list from a file, the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text contract is one of the registered languages. Click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also hold multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; button.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If here is a value registered, the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separately by comma. example: conversation, mail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You will receive the qdbus application program with the program qdbus; the & DBus; -Numbers must leave you. if, for example & qdbus; the user ID coupler-3432 is possible, you can only copy copying.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string chain filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box Diesen filter if agreed. are all input fields empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a language output. this standard contains marks for the control of voices, voice speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for the control of the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviation. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default, the festival is used in the SSML edition.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch is set at the festival configuration dialog, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and satin-recognition filter (SDB filters). SBDs can start reading text in single sets, as only the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text card. thus, you can also jump or stop or stop or stop, even if the language of the language does not support them directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the recognition filter. during the first start of & ktops, it is automatically set up as a propositional filter system automatically. you can change its settings or add other satclimiteration filter, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way, you will learn the setup of speech choices by selecting. switch on the card selection, change some features and check out how the choice of speaking speaker is changing. you must, of course, have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then you can start reading faster with the forereading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text orders on the card-card order, even if the language of the language does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositional filter is automatically set up when you launch the kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, unless removed. do not change in this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satin-recognition filter compare text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tabulatormark (decimal code 8) to the proposition limits (tablature files are removed from the text). note that the default set-up filter controls the character composition.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & KDE; -News (k), Warnings, News or the Edition of Screen-Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you are removed out of default, you can insert this again by setting the standard _ sbdrc file; it contained standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card reader, you can write the speech settings for the application. the card size is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the board card speaker). in other words, no interrelated features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable microphone, which has all characteristics of a furnished speaking speaker. if you don't delete the speaker's settings, select & dictts; this speaker is chosen; otherwise it chooses & dictts; the speaker, which corresponds to the originally introduced properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Please choose the properties of the requested speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box, if the property has the precedence over other features, you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue, it will always be considered as priority property. you will probably need to specify the attribute language, if you know that a certain application will be sent in another language than the result in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the field of speaker, which is equivalent to the list below, click on the box button and then use speaker, which equates to the list below.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr rushes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is shut down and went down. probably, you have to record GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved yet, perhaps a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the card audio, there is a setting speed. that's how it works, the program SOX has to be installed and via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice is this active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the talk speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read it on your own tags, with which speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for converting to & HTML; (see) or if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML-performerfilter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows the management of the network interfaces, routine and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktopsettings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter is displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting from the controlcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & drop menu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical equipment and their drivers have already functional and configurable, so & knetworkconf; the device is at all and allows the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed on installation hardware and Linux. network devices will be added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network setting is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when connected network settings, this used platform will be automatically recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the different selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release will be best. by adjusting the setting of non-restoring, the fixed setting can be permanently taken. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings can only be viewed in system management mode. previously, all options are grey, which means the settings can only be considered, changing system management mode at the right bottom of the module mode. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode the whole functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface serves to manage the system's network devices. all available network devices will be displayed. from the tab network interface, the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The connected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button of the button... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking on Advanced Settings displays the dialogue with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information is performed at each system startup, therefore no further adjustment is required. in the select list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manually, without DHCP or BOOTP, TCP / IP configuration can be performed. in the input field IP address, the required TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialize the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not requested, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values are displayed in this dialog as characteristics of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network should not be used. the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switch-up of a designed network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and click interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specify the IP address of the computer in local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for the TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is connected more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway Computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address. that's necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name to an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the equestrian name solution enables a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNA entries can be arranged through a selection of a contract and backdrop or table-gradation in the list with buttons or to be converted to priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button add... from the group machine to name the name solution, a DNS server can be added. it will add the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you must enter the IP address of DNS server and then click the button. then the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select one entry and then click on the button. it will display the dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of known hosts describes host-to-IP address mode for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server are available. in small, sealed networks, it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally contains the list of known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in the testing version of IP is to replace 4 in the future Version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known host and click Add.... The New alias is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Add the name of the well-known host and add the button add. if the well-known hosts has multiple alias name, button add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select a version of a well known host from the list and select Edit.... The dialog box is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK, the list of static hosts is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings specified in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of the binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & KDE; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console, with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical user like kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE are sufficient; but in addition, development packages will be needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only be experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental networks are given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; transchangeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC is mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). number 5 has never found large spread. from IPv6, it is expected to pass through in the near future. this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is to assign a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation is the contact site that will be used to be a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can not be selected as any event.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from one specifically for this purpose reserved area to avoid IP address associated with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below will not be forwarded by the Internet. therefore, their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually use addresses in the 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 area. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all the hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard Route, the second one loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is needed for the IP continuation.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed in DSL connections, so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, another content is defined there.</seg>

<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the inclusion must be solved initially. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; announces a change in the symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the band can now be thrown out without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>

<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity is & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the band are lost, the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the safest files. this can happen on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in local file tree. it is secured only that file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the specified files are stored in the profile.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the band's content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This ensures a collision profile with just selected files and default settings. you can make for a safety profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder, in which the backup should be done. the list of the safest files is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only the files are stored in the same file system, such as the folders. folder, which are based on other file systems, you can set separately on backup files. each entry is viewed from tar irrespective of the others.</seg>

<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must be distributed to the non-rewinding version of the band's device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This attitude is active, communicated & kdat; before the band is integrated, the command load load on the drive. in some drives it is necessary to be performed before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; to lock the cast off at tape drive. possibly this attitude does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when solving the integration of & kdat; automatically cast the band. do not use this option at Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; the hardware block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this attitude is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case, the block size is required for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is set together as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n bytes) The band-ID. the format of this string is host: seconds, whereby the host name is the full name of the system, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds, which have been formatted since the period in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives, which can operate directly with & GNU / tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act to create incremental collages.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksSystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer viewer for inexperienced users can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system or where the system allows quick access to information about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksSystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer works in the background. is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksSystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems which appear on their server. & ksSystemlog; therefore, try to provide some extended functions, with their help the protocol files can be filtered and analysed.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksSystemlog; a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocols, for the format of Syslog Servers and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included, and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, presents & ksSystemlog; features available, with whose help the individual protocol-lines of a protocol-file can easily filter and sort out. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After start & kssystemlog, first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed, and it will be held instead of a small message window. the protocol files are usually found in folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not own permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar, in order to filter out a selected criterion or to set the strings in the filter bar. in the default settings the selection box will be displayed next to the filter line. then, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another record, of course, only with entries in the set file system protocol, then select the column process in accordance with the option of a process, and choose the name of a process, so show you & ksSystemlog; all protocol-lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level error will be displayed with a more striking colour than protocol lines of the stage. the colour display of protocol-lines can be posted.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example, in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command, such as for example, to start the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksSystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subtypes. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you select a window, select a protocol to display the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksSystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksSystemlog.forum-software.or. Dort you will find further information about the source of & kssystemlog;.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system is rapidly developing as standard for programming of programming in the & Linux; world. and therefore because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binder file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because anyone could try to set a machine on System V Init, without any reinstallation and reformwork. that's why you need to be sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a sub-file of / etc are directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following more folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service to start the system or change to another lap level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services are not having such items such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie below / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not require a lot of use in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something when you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for various places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a row like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably notice that the default set-level 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can manually repair it, then you will manually repair it by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no right files are available. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts are so written that there is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish you a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running, that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is simple to say not trivial: simply draw one entry from the range of availability of availability to one of the six laps to start at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts between Runleveln or move the position within one level by going to go somewhere else. this is not only removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens if they draw one entry from the field of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you select this in a new range. to select it only on a new Runlevel, you need to select explicitly copy from the menu Edit or add to the target range -- even then, if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries in the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different working ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection Ober- or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To shift one entry into another lap level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change sorting order or change the name of a entry manually, press the tab button to change between different fields. connect the dialog through repressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; again. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine will start constantly anew. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the lilo Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have planned some systems services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you have to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are launched in these distributions, but does not simplify the configuration of proprietary systems from the distribution, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution, please check if all configuration files are available (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply complete without news if your configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have done modifications, you have to store them. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. first if you can make extended system settings, you will be able to make individual settings, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD uniform.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The flashcard password administration appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD uniform.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card Card appears only if you have to activate and initialize in at least one-connected filesystem (Quota), and initialize (recognizable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for any user, whereby the placements are available in KB.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually, for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field of file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups informs information about the category of selected user. the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the primitive group. furthermore, users can select in other groups by mark them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, create this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select from the user or group or click on the matching adding button of the tool bar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the lilo bootmanager, adding and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, change, change and more.</seg>
