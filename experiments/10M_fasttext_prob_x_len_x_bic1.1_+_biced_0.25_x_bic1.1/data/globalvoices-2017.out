although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have danced to American music , American writers and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was a journalist for the American film .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orters , who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ Student , who were the Supreme Court with judges who were willing to occupy its interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of same minded people .
I even had a very shy love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump arrived .
much has been written about the tourist host@@ ility and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes with its narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops behind the mountain , as it is so beautiful .
he says exactly what he says , as a former colleague put it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ e and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes that he won with the Republican pre@@ elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the party .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
like for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic programme , the people from around the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps universe did not agree with the initiative by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I strug@@ gling with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
she is still with the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace , and helped me to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
those people and those who em@@ bodies the values kept my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump traveled towards the nominated Republican presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe because of its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ looked these things , almost the heart collapsed .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to signi@@ fy the tr@@ ump voters as a rac@@ ist .
to as@@ sign the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
that is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ tful and suggests a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be considered .
could it be that this elec@@ torate , of which most are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to restore control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks different with contemp@@ t upon those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( with regard to the White vs. all other eth@@ nic@@ ities , &quot; Word play from white in play on the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much means sk@@ id@@ ling trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , exactly did that which America has done so great .
millions people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background is always like , America is welcome every welcome .
for this country chosen as his pre@@ sidents , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ er , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas , this promise and says : to Hell with mani@@ fold , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the ru@@ der , they say .
with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration by Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of a change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd breaks .
&quot; Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; could someone who isn &apos;t like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and powerful &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was like , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in common ?
the music that is played at both sites is not only changing the life of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby splendid ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ des ) has been playing in the church : one of the children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments have a possibility to overcome them .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the B@@ anden &apos;s violence .
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilots who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth .
young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come and play with shining eyes and play in the chest you learn daily for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ designed instruments consist of local fixed waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of Fa@@ vio Cha@@ vez started to transform parts of the case into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ ins , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trumpet and percussion that were produced from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Cha@@ ins re@@ members a local Ec@@ ological instructor and Musi@@ cians of the Children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the starting time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them live together with their children .
the changed was shown as a Fa@@ vio , which he had never seen before : a violin brought violin .
today , there is a whole orchestra which is based on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary on &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
every year , the world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste every year .
those who live with him and live from him are the troubles - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra also played his music in front of Pope Francis :
this East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted over international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to the common use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had run illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were so up@@ set aside and slightly til@@ ted to welcome a law of this species on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the farmers , Mozambique and the Seychelles , mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refused to spend one of their har@@ bours and refused to share him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that you simply ref@@ using , &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan f@@ isheries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship of the time and persecuted .
in 2013 the ship was driven out from the waters of the region : it did not succeed to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y Stop ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar to the six countries who had driven the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , essential for it is extremely difficult to trace . there@@ with , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate contemp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and types should be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may have a del@@ ik@@ ate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ mer@@ ed by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the snow@@ fall , the actions nowadays occur in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries , for example , can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea , with satellite data .
this allows the authorities to character@@ ize ships which are fishing in banned areas - such as susp@@ ects that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships .
ideally , such examinations may show whether the involved ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal attor@@ ney .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their har@@ bours , which means that the ships cannot sell their load . and that they may even be forced to pay for the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ ally supported by the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i of each year because of the illegal fisher@@ man that penet@@ rate East African waters .
East Africa has produced one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these are also illegal fishermen .
at their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake licensing papers , speci@@ ality of ph@@ ant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale si@@ p@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investig@@ ational ships .
it has exposed criminal networks exposed to fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it has been persecuted and found .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority on the fight of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances and received .
&quot; some of our investigations carry us quite far into the networks of organizing crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be further developed , also helps to trace the illegal ships to hide .
&quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal Fischer are using very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , Head Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO that is also concerned with f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships , for example , switch their automatic identification systems , where@@ with they can no longer be used by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information related information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Maritime Organisation Oce@@ ana platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed around the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system gives the persecution of ships .
there is signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i don &apos;t just feel criminal activity , but they also deter them .
ships , previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license and could hardly be reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries , since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board to@@ gri@@ ds , whose use is forbidden .

other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also have to copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually will disappear a year by illegal fishing .
there will be six countries together in 2015 , towards the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member Somalia could report its first big triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was also without license and were used to@@ pp@@ nets , which are meanwhile prohibited .
the ship was still prohibited in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative work for protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , The New York Times and in The Guardian . location in Venezuela is going to move on : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of re@@ conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government has rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes shut the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into the void , assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the Order of Venezuela ) , these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute deficiency of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the counter@@ part of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the removal of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government &apos;s context as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , which is estimated to be the highest in the world ( the inflation rate will be estimated at 500 % to the annual degree ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the only way to withdraw its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .
the election of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic entity ) , the demonstr@@ ators planned to join the National Assembly as well as a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government , should continue to continue on the 27th of October .
the appeal was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is due to Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday national strike and on 3 November all after Caracas at Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

the images of the fairy , which are published in real time , testify to a vast involvement of people in numerous territories in the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the prot@@ ec@@ tor@@ rent , &quot; Will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; she cri@@ es out of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans .
it is enough , without sh@@ it .

on Twitter suggest images that relate of disp@@ utes , as well as reports of supp@@ ression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the message through police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local Cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but protests went on .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts because you could see anything else , what many national gar@@ ages do not have !
meanwhile , an Inf@@ ographic makes the round that forms the extent of oppression a day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part in question - this was now proven in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs are :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fake .
here is your counter@@ part !
on the road !
some think these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which made little against the devastating economic crisis , and rather busy preparing critical voices of critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more in frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of a interviews from Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities at La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in CÃ³rdoba , against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano is not looking for his life .
starting with the office , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operation in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed in the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a sal@@ inity .
as a child with 15 years , it is not noticed that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not recognize that my father was a thief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and rob@@ bers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ gated . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father of state terrorism was his father from 1976 to 1978 , Deputy Commander of the Service Department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced in the course of the years the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent about his child , and as this child chose a way of redemption .
from sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts made .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and requested me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are an ass@@ hole , you have committed yourself with one of the ERP .
pass only that they don &apos;t take you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina &apos;s Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be obe@@ yed .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ Where are the prisoners subjected to torture &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were shut down and under@@ took me with a guard .
suddenly he insi@@ sted on an open space , saying :
then the prisoners are tortured .
I moved in , and saw a song , tortured on the man .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal feathers .
later , I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of the cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they swe@@ eten a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ shot him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volt in the gen@@ itals .

the rock there was in it there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this od@@ our .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&quot; I knew that these people were killed . &quot;
when my father took me for the third time for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were ch@@ illed with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried out eyel@@ ids .
he talked with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , an civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , where naked people were lying down with the face down - all were raised in hands and feet .
near the entran@@ ce@@ ful people quietly wait for the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look so , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
I met &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that , because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man and killed .
( according to survivors from civilians , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of death in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was also indicted by the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , chief of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way , which you came in here , is also the way you came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of discovery .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of them should be re@@ located .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things to his home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military signs which one ab@@ uses an enemy .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .

but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I was asked about how my father , the director of security forces , could be involved in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
and once he called me a crimin@@ als , and I answered : and thou that steal cars on the road ?
you are no crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded anger , stroke me , and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and embrace you .
we don &apos;t need any other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that , on which I bore a jacket and a wheel pul@@ lover from wool . both my father had from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me to have been a def@@ endant with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to announce .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the bodies is the last se@@ per@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I receive mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have children once , one can recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is in@@ correct to kill .
I even went so far to say :
good , you were ex@@ propri@@ ated during the dictatorship of the dictatorship , but why does the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children do children ?
one day my father brought a girl with home his mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill those people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families , to which one could be handed over to their mort@@ al rem@@ nants ?
the disappearance of the bodies is the last se@@ per@@ ous act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
they were crushed and cared for somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; my father said .
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
only to put it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , my Father , was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him reproach for all of the atro@@ cities that I had to do with him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
I felt in@@ wardly , and asked myself why the whole @-@ driven patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended themselves were well .
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
he said only &quot; Na then show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can interpre@@ t me that I have vo@@ ke . I finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest even before the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 416 crimes : among them heavier , un@@ just@@ ification of imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent shadow of death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended between March 1975 and December 1978 , crimes against 7@@ 16 victims , finally in August .
for crimes against humanity was found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court sentenced to life sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were fre@@ es@@ ize .
eleven of the 54 accused were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by counter@@ part . # Es@@ war@@ state terrorism
all def@@ endants were , during the dictatorship of the military , including former military , former police officers and civil employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped and brought back to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant women in June 1976 .
he raised the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was created by a death factory by in@@ human heads .
the court is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for many years in righteousness for many years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of men who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but research took 39 years .
in March 2007 the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the land on which La Per@@ la was erected in order to be erected there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; aw@@ k@@ able drivers &quot;
the sign with the transmission errors at a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend its driving licence .
the photo was distributed in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very successful translation .
on a sign the Japanese word has been replaced by the &quot; older drivers &quot; which means &quot; older drivers &quot; , but maybe even with ar@@ ches back@@ ups and # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; aw@@ able driver . &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
work of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often divided into social media .
the mistake was a translator Julian Holmes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also att@@ ested to the local papers .
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n Kyoto , Kyoto , published in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes said .
the in@@ correct English translation was first removed . the name &quot; Att@@ ach@@ ers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate as also gramm@@ atically not quite correct name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police in the Kyoto predic@@ ts for translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from trans@@ lators , and that the translation was not checked on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are very sorry that older people felt threatened by in@@ adequate correc@@ ting ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News consisted of a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers &quot; in Japan , and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ oun@@ cing as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there are older car drivers involved in accidents , but quite a occasion to worry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen down , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period has risen .
the rep@@ ain@@ less rep@@ orters published in the article published on Yahoo comments to the light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese are apparently opposed to older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error was received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a true translation error . &quot;
there aren &apos;t few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true foundation for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
to overcome , you need two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires active master@@ y of the target language - something that in native language is the case . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators are in the target language - not in the language language - native language should be .
thus , a French native language should be translated from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no employees in English as a native language , which could make translations into English . this may seem to be a lack of understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn the Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees , have translations to produce fir@@ s intern@@ ally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English language is considered the best , to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ying and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that are created by machine translations , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , which often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to read or understood at all .

translation errors may be un@@ acceptable , or at least harmless . but of large enterprises or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serial source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cen@@ sored measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users , that they have no access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are also no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ caster over@@ contributed the recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by opposition groups that contra@@ dict the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred its duties to the executive and the Supreme Court themselves .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is kissed , and recommended the Us@@ ers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites ven@@ enn@@ ese providers are locked again .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ites with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been negoti@@ ating on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation would report them with fin@@ es and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and extensive national television channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
surprisingly , that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly bears their meetings .
former research institute of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , were revealed that the local internet service providers were to use DNS . this is a technique to answer certain domains of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNA , the server answers err@@ one@@ ous or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ong@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera was Elvis Flo@@ res who carried the protests in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thereby , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ites will increasingly difficult access to multimedia coverage in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will become slaves to slaves , to obtain an apprentices@@ hip
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas who were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Kur@@ saal , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; fet@@ ch cows , falling schools &quot; ) which will be edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the University , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
who has become something of something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas den@@ otes for more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money gives her min@@ der@@ ous son or her under@@ age @-@ old daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , an apprentices@@ hip and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , however , that the children need to afford countless days of household work that may never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse of abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract you can &apos;t raise .
as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , practice is widely used in Paraguay because of the involvement and acceptance through large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she talked with cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls who are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - gathered testimony , responded and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things on behalf , because feeling the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general stand@@ still .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is , on the other hand , the family that their daughter is in faith that they will improve their education , improving their position in society and to make something out of itself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that the girls takes up and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fying by faith that they would have given someone a chance , otherwise no training would have been hungry , and perhaps even be hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
if the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only be experienced many years later .
sometimes they never experienced it .
in January 2016 there was relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of severe impacts . shortly thereafter , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former military belonging to Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as an official member of the residents .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in late January 2016 , Fer@@ reira suggested to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported about the incident .
they looked at that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deeply responsible for the death of the girl , Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go &apos;s death .
they called the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and called that there are &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an important investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girls who had their Cri@@ ad@@ ita was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
if the case comes before the case , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be a landmark case - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as a labor force , they live isolated from other girls in her old age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , who worked in her father , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost their father to work .
their brothers had to go all work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market conf@@ essions to make money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
in their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , she had to share the time that you still remained time to learn .
it stood every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employers .
on Fri@@ days for example , they pur@@ ged the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floor .
when the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she was done with learning , the more leisure it had .
but this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but got no unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the master of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembered .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the master of the good@@ man Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the bud@@ get@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , along with him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero , &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give testimony to the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
he held her for intelligent , but did not under@@ go with her . &quot; the master of the master had found someone who was talking about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; in the opinion , that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak home to her mother tongue Guar@@ ani .
their Lord feared the education that they had made , they would lose .
it was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she had paid them with their hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans to whom cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I could not invite to myself at home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time , where friends arise , I felt especially clear that I was one of the group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share this job for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the chairman of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ovsky , a city council in As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small lawyer for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
learn to learning .
please call you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Lik@@ es &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave birth to her telephone number .
another woman , which came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote .
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland inner that wants to work . &quot;
then the author divided the display again :
dear friends , I have found one . I saw if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the shop was completed .
in pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of testimony to former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( an economic system of the early history of the Spanish conqu@@ ers ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res who received the workers of Guar@@ ani and to their &quot; wives &quot; ( with whom the workers had to be viewed as a half @-@ slaves ) and to provide Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination . therefore , it is not willing to maintain that many girls and boys become involved in a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill to register Egyptian users social media to register with the government
image by Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees submitted a draft bill to &quot; the regulations concerning the usage and working social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is instructed to share citizens with citizens , citizens and citizens .
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their users in the site with their correct name and personnel numbers to use social networks .
will it be reconc@@ iled to do this , so it could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video setup and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear as it is assumed if the draft does not make reference to the user , as Egyptian authorities are able to im@@ pose the user &apos;s users and users who do not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Parliament chief and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through the fire@@ wall to get the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( based on German &quot; senior research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , talked Global Vo@@ ices :
I pay attention to the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they are violent , physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then it means that they will be able to set up a powerful surveillance system to help citizens to monitor the approval or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a court process .
this is technically not all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed by legislative elections and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees before it goes to the plenary debate .
whether his assumption and implementation will be successful or not , the design is consistent with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that there is no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
in the past year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ y proposed a draft agreement against Cy@@ ber crime , which was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the shelter H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation of Iraq are working to protect the vacc@@ inated Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , who are stri@@ ped through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to the loss of sav@@ our@@ age , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less prey .
why is this specific type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the thought of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in fact is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks out R@@ aza in pure joy .
as an educated Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which is not only from war and conflict .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the progress made for the Nor@@ theast Japan &apos;s newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , who had been adv@@ ancing in the past six years , had been affected by the &quot; thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fukus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a et@@ ely pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , both experienced the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring towns of Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to be vac@@ ated , because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished the coastline of the map .
yet the Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , already alone some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made on the progress of six years after that , to rebuild the local resident resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing situation in Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( s . ) , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fukus@@ hima forms the final table with 70 percent .
even six years after the catastrophe , it was still trying to evacu@@ ate the evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el &apos;s Coun@@ try@@ side and evacu@@ ated in the final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ cav@@ ity catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in heating .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate .
almost 40 per cent of the evacu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima still live in emergency sleeping , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated apartments were settled down after the disaster .
for I@@ w@@ ate lies the number here at 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , have opened its doors to December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation in Fukus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident occurred in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land large @-@ scale .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed ar@@ able land in Fukus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fukus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ aza . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures the tourism has recovered so far , but again Fukus@@ hima still remains dis@@ rup@@ ted .
the tourist taxes in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fukus@@ hima one can only offer 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to make their living .
is the indigenous population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
to determine the overall image , the newspaper brought numerous surveys under the local population and evacu@@ ated among the evacu@@ ation . they in@@ quired about the status of reconstruction and also how you meet against the tsun@@ ami risk .
in their introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness among the indigenous population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident population have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of the respondents found that still not enough for cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention was done .
as it stands for those who are evacu@@ ated from the Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has intensi@@ fied its attention also on the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima .
Fukus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also the witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ logy @-@ caused , nuclear accident , which had to be seen in Japan .
almost 63 000 people evacu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima were re@@ located in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses .
after 2017 , around 40 000 inhabitants of Fukus@@ hima still live outside their homeland pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ phic areas , most of the evacu@@ ate areas are still more than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper heating projects because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukus@@ hima have to compete with massive building projects , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come from other countries that speak a different language , the differences are first to be larger than simil@@ arities .
after a while , one often recognizes that a more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that get often less attention than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly associated with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ana Cam@@ ar@@ asa re@@ members how the love of music worked in the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva on a widespread photograph .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered in the intensive care unit : last Friday it was a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia in a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against spar@@ sely .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on Saturday and then moved to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures also shows the face of the police officer , which was identified with a bu@@ zz@@ ling strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ a@@ io .
following the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ a@@ io had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service .
the pictures depic@@ ts the police officer , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia and his bu@@ zz@@ ling on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officers came up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; the video channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video on the net where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several san@@ it@@ ters shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but also filmed from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
at the bottom of the clip , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to facilitate his family in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police custody . &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activist from his father was murdered , only to crimin@@ alise the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary School . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police station , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has sm@@ itten him with a striking stock .
transfer of police
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to demonstr@@ ating brutal police officers to protest@@ ers last Friday .
polic@@ emen were used at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media prot@@ agon@@ ists have ver@@ ts the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disk .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate with a photo their title pages illustr@@ ative .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a bla@@ sted bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic foundation , more about a broken window , than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must also recognize if one is stri@@ pped against any form of non@@ damage .
here too , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , consistent importance , and the typical violence of the military police are linked with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on con@@ frontation with the police . &quot;
the For@@ ced villages in Cuba by the un@@ induc@@ ing forgotten villages
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar raw factories in Cuba included the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People &apos;s Community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - well known that there are no significant sug@@ ars on site .
it is two years ago , when the activity in the sugar tubes were la@@ yed .
after the earthquake , the sugar raw industry was still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ ute every day to the factories , which still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a sol@@ der veter@@ an that rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar raw industry do not rob@@ bed his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar raw factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long time , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar raw factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar raw materials resi@@ sts the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount .
the news should have been a motive for lack of evidence for the country for some decades , but the bad harvest is no longer any more .
why was the Cuban sugar raw industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar raw industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar tubes were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production targets amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they only left factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar raw plant@@ ations and the su@@ gar@@ dening on the global market .
nonetheless , the sugar price rose from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report of &quot; Agricultural Spec@@ trum &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Nutrition Organization .
if current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go with security into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on the process of re@@ structure began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the breast@@ feeding of 98 sugar tubes came to more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar raw factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier is known to talk about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; betra@@ yal . &quot;
almost all respondents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
thus the place is preserved , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first shooting year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed to documents that are only distinguished by the parts that would be removed , the address satellite and the date distingu@@ ishes .
everyone was signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve every decision .
from then on , the responsibility and the letters were becoming more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the finishing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for those in operation of the sugar raw factories , &quot; he as@@ sures us .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the breast@@ feeding of the factory , whose construction he helped , involved .
with each part , he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located , were created .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut talk of October 21 , 2002 , the then president of the present persons present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes
sugar cane has been extracted only high by M@@ HL since 2004 .

after two years the public community of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar refin@@ ery completed , or better said , when they began to ex@@ pose it , they stopped listening to the road to asph@@ alted , dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they were given to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people also left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not used once for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .

first Nations Youth Day use hip @-@ hop to express itself and maintain their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo uses permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
you@@ ths of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do them by hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops have been offering workshops directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will ensure that the young generation of participants in our conversations such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever you can find in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the family of Kit@@ sum@@ i , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were w@@ asted or murdered .
the cases were mostly not clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video games to con@@ vey how important of receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always able to control the languages of the First Nations languages .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ lean @-@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us was sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people involved young people received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as translation into English , translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever interested in me ?
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead to our youth as well
so they can do that , what they determined the Creator
in the commentary piece , the reader and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a post and add the verse in sil@@ en@@ code ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( of course ) outside a typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan it can be seen before almost any restaurant plastic dishes .
in order to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , will be found close to the intervention of sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( P@@ ig , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of every food served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing this plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that were documented by the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even drive them anymore . however , a new trend is transformed today in current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
near Na@@ ver Mat@@ oms the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes , decorated cell phone bands , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ ten collective objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the Es@@ sen@@ ces will increasingly be more complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we also have produced this part in Tokyo at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple who &apos;s holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight @-@ flight .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there anyone who would say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also be accept@@ ing a less appeti@@ zing form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting the ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Ear@@ rings and wrist@@ bands from dried salmon .
other quir@@ ky plastic dishes can be seen below : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ oms blog post . or follow on Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 called t .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the benefit of the restaurant industry . as for example , the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for victims of fighting against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media over the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the crimin@@ als and tum@@ bling are regularly immer@@ sed in statistics . however , this mirror does not reflect the extent of human tragedy that brings together this battle .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background .
a day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or to the communities that have learned to live with pain .
there are behind each suffering , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds might never heal .
therefore , the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trading life &quot; ) , telling this victims a voice and tells stories of people who were fighting in the struggle between law en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is describing the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; how frigh@@ tened life &quot; ) tells the story exactly these stories .
a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father that is seeking every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ ws .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have set us , get started and to graves after the people who we loved to seek . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on October 13 .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you do not pay the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender &apos;s Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and the state management .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a writer of animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post in Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never take violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have already known illness and sensation journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come over every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images that are actually only from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ correct or considered normal .
she writes further :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hel@@ pl@@ aten &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , it is as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them .
I see our weakness when stories are being exposed to statistics in a statistic .
the in@@ el@@ essness of man is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified , that they were &quot; rising . &quot;
I think they try to talk about that they are sp@@ ared from these trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of relief in the main town district : &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als took money for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you .
I asked myself in this terrible days , if you would like to dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I must learn how to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the most distinguished generation . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assassin@@ ated by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Bryan is a mad@@ man and he tells himself how to make a egg co@@ oks , potatoes , tortillas , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence , and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody suffering of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw it :
Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Federal Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosecutor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 murders . this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day .
these are only some hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the country &apos;s soul .
only a few stories still live in view of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the Nar@@ co@@ data project in 2015 , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trade , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in a comprehen@@ sible way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he left , contain images that are represented on violence .
the fac@@ simile check is important in a moment in which it &apos;s about lifting a rum@@ or or to un@@ mask a fake .
but how is the years after being immer@@ sed for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to stand further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it has been completely used to create trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there is abundant reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , questions about our desire to look for messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a fleet of petrol cars crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous har@@ ness full of impact holes that were difficult to run .
trag@@ ically , the fuel tank fell victim to the victim .
skilled representatives described a fire@@ ball who covered dozens of houses including a cinema that was full of people who were full of people watching the football world championship .
houses viol@@ ated and scattered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; Das is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of hidden body , which are up@@ set on the floor , while people look at them .
but the story does not find its end here .
over the years the same photo was refresh@@ ed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but are fal@@ sely explained in the context of trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ le@@ aned Nig@@ erian towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ov@@ on .
ophthalm@@ ologists reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down , and were dead in streets and bones .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were killed .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count Lei@@ chen , &quot; said a human rights to Human Rights Watch .
many were crushed , shot or burnt .
the follow @-@ up period could be shown on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempted B@@ oko Har@@ am trying to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image came back from the DR Congo as a proof for the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of defects ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the image was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
another step further bring personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely explained the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also joined the fatal persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee battles , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following on , which gathered these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was fal@@ sely explained by President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to detect this information .
the original contribution , on the last of April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , who called AFP as their source , were also fal@@ sely explained to this statement , but had not been associated with the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide operating range of false information
traces of this false coupling range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far information borders can be exceeded .
a inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures found , which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask , private sites , social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , many others tried to un@@ mask the forg@@ eries .
we have developed examples of the ab@@ used use and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on which side they have been published . as a result , we would like to represent the range of more evident than the language alone .
there are several examples in some cases linked from the listed countries ( which were also linked in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can still be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copy of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ derly countries refer to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ se@@ hood .
the countries in grey are examples , which are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via the Tin@@ y@@ Eye , probably even for@@ gery @-@ examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( judged in Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side , which leaves rum@@ ors , turned into question that the said photo Christians were killed , which were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article a blo@@ gger from Quebec City is not only the counterfeit message , but also discuss the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in the context of Nigeria and further questions after the int@@ entions of persons and in the wrapped up trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los c@@ rist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria they burned the Christians ) .

La Rep@@ ublic@@ a lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .

t@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , used to illustr@@ ate the image from the DR Congo in order to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; clearly , have seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that ref@@ ute this .

this statement was contra@@ sted by a Greek fac@@ e@@ check @-@ page 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of the students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about the news agency Nas@@ im and used to illustr@@ ate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a inhabitants of the old town Pie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tr@@ ento post@@ ete this message to his page to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo of the DR Congo has been a proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombing in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia also offers two extreme example for a mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , on the other hand , and on the other hand of a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to del@@ ig@@ ate , since the photos were ab@@ used in use .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government issued a rival to what they had been intenti@@ onally @-@ drawn news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this position , which exclusively appeared in English , includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that have been using Spe@@ ech Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to present that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and the opposite ( which is often spread by bur@@ ge@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post that addressed to the members of the Russian orthodo@@ x church , clearly indicates that the image of the DR was NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ an may have been cleared in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought together the story with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture is still contained in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly explained that the picture is not written by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ship attack . &quot;
when the picture later became in circulation with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in circulation in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ dict that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and on the eve of Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took place in the name of the Islam@@ s , which took part in the name of the Islam@@ s .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ered as proof of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not accessed in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message which allegedly had been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ erian massacre was put into circulation , discussion forums as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to the Counter@@ feit Det@@ ector .
from the message which included the image from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further examples of in@@ correct use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , ag@@ gregate ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ y@@ Eye continues , but are not completely tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data inser@@ ts with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ wler and unite them via image file in the context of Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which first appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately make a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( frame ) that po@@ ise these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major discussions about the silence in connection with the killing of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understanding and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer belief .
with social media , there are some kind of people who are un@@ intenti@@ onally controlled , the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this mood of the mis@@ - and counterfeit information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ates the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that there is a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are demanded by the victims itself .
at the same time , concern that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures of readers and viewer Des@@ en@@ si@@ bil@@ ize and giving them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , exam@@ ining how violent media make it work to help others ) .
while some more regarding non@@ violent represent@@ ations exist in the news media , fact is fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat sug@@ ars , which is actually replaced by the context or completely ab@@ used manner .
each examination in@@ correct zu@@ tions , however , should be considered as internationally it can be .

one word or expression is not sufficient , why a complete declaration and sometimes somewhat context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists include Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog we &apos;ll find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :

in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog over :
they grin@@ d other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island nation Sri Lanka currently sees the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon caused by the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya stepped into 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore .
according to a statement by the disaster of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missed due to the floods and s@@ amm@@ ate .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence .
the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas left slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible territories .
the following images and videos con@@ vey an impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood catastrophe :
high tide at Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water walls of up to 7.5 m . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka are supplying regular updates to high @-@ water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are missing the Den@@ pas@@ ef@@ ie@@ tic crisis , Save the Children , after further rainfall are already on the road .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus located in the floods , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the floo@@ ding of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Luftwaffe has set five aircraft for rescue actions and another five are made for transport of emergency deliveries for the residents in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water supply and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams are required for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for high @-@ water victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ Me @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app to inform Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ thal@@ um .
last year after the disaster of the tropical forest Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me took a &quot; High @-@ Water Aid &quot; button , which allowed users allowed to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they have then been for@@ warded to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross .
in addition , they launched a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which included more than thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat actions for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully trained , bringing inhabitants in need in safety and afford assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , with Sri Lanka &apos;s population , the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

approved for .@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust her four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children , she is my rock in bran@@ ce .
in one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next row we add rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , other channels and against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my friend looks at me and says : &quot; these things do not affect you , right ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; I wonder .
I have already run this conversation .
people with whom I am working or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in its performance .
they de@@ mus@@ li@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we will put all into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , which do not fit there , will be mus@@ li@@ zed .
de@@ mus@@ li@@ zing will be
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet that poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures are coming in the sense when you think about it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ xer Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea , religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of Muslims , the Western books have already been colon@@ ised for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark men you should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images also stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues .
I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , err@@ one@@ ous nar@@ r@@ ative of our news feeds .
this narr@@ ative o@@ vers@@ ha@@ dow the reality that led to their countries in the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even vote their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women will prevent her head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both of the two sides of the same coin .
a mighty group practic@@ ed his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ativ weak@@ ens Muslim women to lead the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which had been brought to the slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this sc@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective pre@@ operative force , deeply and in@@ correct , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are often used to target tim@@ us@@ li@@ mic attacks and c@@ ic@@ an@@ cies .
because of these stories we tell and because of what we tell you , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but rather fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create sc@@ ars who help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to have failed to capture the nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims who make up the highest level of &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the total Muslim population are African @-@ born Americans .
six of ten US Muslims belong to the immig@@ rant of the first generation that origin@@ ate from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents were in New York to live in order to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard to the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made by the Muslim , American statist@@ icians from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were injured Muslims and Americans .
but am I wrong now , Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of fet@@ ch my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs , who carry all Muslims in themselves - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I hear , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who stri@@ ve to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ for@@ ged Islam@@ opho@@ bic arm@@ ada with banknotes , think tanks and experts for the counterfeit information which is already a Muslim ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell , and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a stranger , who ri@@ ps the head@@ scar@@ f .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on Mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslim , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they rely on the following terms : believe , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girl@@ friend would see my neighbour , my neighbor , my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ish rit@@ ual with my daughter if I like it in my arms , and her the Arab verses to protect the Koran , who are called the Koran and the Q@@ s .
every of them I repeat three times .
I pray therefore that they are protected from evil , the evil which one can see and evil which one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , when she gains an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters , sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother &apos;s maternal part with her sisters , as they win a competition of the art of floral artists in Kar@@ achi before decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their complete and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and a Cor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , that it can virtually expres@@ sive .
Muslim is to be the prayer which she had said to speak to me , if I have a bad day .
to be the Muslim , as she has taught me to do with God , Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who has been colon@@ ised by a &quot; empire &quot; through a &quot; empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name of ven@@ erable British Eastern India Com@@ pan@@ ie , has it a deep meaning , God , to call my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men don &apos;t weep , but at the same time to see that my other grandfather wept .
in the meantime , while he writes books on the modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an died because of his family in India , his family that he had not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn by colon@@ ists , who shared the Muslim world as at stake risk .
Muslim Brotherhood means to know that in the past two centuries Europeans have colon@@ ised all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first fly her@@ ed@@ itary history was thrown off in front of a Muslim country over a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , a Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir , subject to the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before it had airplanes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , it goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ e ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means that there were fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tica in Iraq , to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means that if a tragedy is home to the USA and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story tells four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a freed black slaves .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
it is the warmth , which I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and if we count black life .
an American woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , a Muslim , and a journalist , is the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our associated ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate to others .
the nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion bir@@ ths is more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
to be a mother , to make me feel my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that power@@ full and privileged people build on this bi@@ dity of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in the Muslim regi@@ sters that began with President Bush and president Obama under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in immigration officials , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just across the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which particip@@ ates largely in Arabs and Muslims .
there are wars that we lead and the bombs that we cast in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and due to those who do not tell us today , we are here .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed scientifically un@@ real image and desired them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning evolution .
Muslims got the least score .
the conversation , which we have to conduct
we are too deep to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the err@@ one@@ ous and dangerous image expression , which we ste@@ er in our news .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our multiple with bin@@ ds and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Sea Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ ges , an initiative of printing Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the pak@@ ist@@ ically , Muslim , American super@@ hero , all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ atives , who want to show the complexity and interpretation of the Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global time , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go out over 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for the con@@ spir@@ ational theore@@ ti@@ cian who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ ential because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by making the &quot; others &quot; created .
a few years before , it had not given them yet ; now they reign great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story of which I was not aware when I was so old now , as I was my daughter now , but who made me today to an innocent Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that make our humanity , likes to listen to a story , where somebody is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley finding con@@ vers@@ ations in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism , &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
these are not the terms , with which we usually throw in our schools around us , or which we read in our papers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why are I t@@ aming this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the shooting of the &quot; others &quot; in public conception , which had been conducted by Stan@@ ford for four decades ago .

initiative for narr@@ ative art wants to keep urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ elling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with someone else in connection ?
Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently over a different initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated Blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken language . it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of major cities and to appreciate .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has been carried out in the United States since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not included in the children born there .
for the makers of the project , :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we assume cities , accept@@ ing dens@@ ities - safe rooms , in which residents do not have to forget who they are .
while &quot; listen often to understand &quot; the listen@@ er of these events instead &quot; to listen to feel &quot; to feel &quot; . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller put their history first in their own language and translate or declare it in English .
even though the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation are that the listen@@ ers can be submitted .
they call laugh@@ ing and emotions , as the language no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou takes the opportunity to explain the history of the narr@@ ative of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the b@@ ula of the bun@@ ny and Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the meaning of his f@@ ist , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . everyone who are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the U.S. reconstruction of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico , several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ re@@ location Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went down to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dan@@ o p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church assembly of Puerto Rico .
the inter@@ cess@@ ation of the debt relief of debt have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the politicians , banks and government agencies , who are responsible for the debt , for their corruption .
we call for financial testing and a cable committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions , re@@ mun@@ eration , which must benefit in favour of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king profit@@ ability .
we require immediate action .
the island - not into the country &apos;s bund@@ led territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the government infrastructure .
measures are imposed from the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; Night@@ watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :
protest@@ ers prepare for the march .

photo of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that will be al@@ igned in Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist born in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Ru@@ hl@@ ing , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom series , produced by so @-@ called &apos; book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ en extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ca ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was released last year and is licensed here , contains a series of par@@ agra@@ phs that deal with free culture in face of oppression .
it &apos;s a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what the real cost is associated with which this is associated .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have been involved in the movements of free knowledge have been working on site to view over the fog , which conver@@ ts our news@@ feeds and to create a little sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ ons in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us will begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ ely extreme beliefs ?
since March 2012 , the web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel based on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; given command of the Military Court in A@@ dra was taken . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been cont@@ acted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and the knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and presently persu@@ aded the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes anticip@@ ating the work that he started working with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construc@@ ting the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous civilization and melting the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ de@@ ed traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything to this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stun@@ t to digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time cap@@ sul@@ sel which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not close this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life , of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even as he was already in prison .
I have learned English to read and talk English .
he always has his knowledge to be asked with everyone who asked . he has taught other in@@ mates to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other in@@ mates , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually stopped one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a pro@@ vocation that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is licensed freely .
book covers from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens . &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I am in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the senses in the moment , in which we embrace us ,
that any of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of f@@ ences , arm@@ chairs and guard
I forget the in@@ doors of the prison
and I was in every detail of your voice and words ,
I bear with passion for me ,
when your eyes may say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and over your absence to weep and smile .
I bear witness myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
one year passes , my soul
while
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of the Monster
Bass@@ els &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) since the start of protests in 2011 , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) disappeared .
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime , were tortured or executed .
since 2011 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many further people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community announces the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : resur@@ rec@@ ted by corruption , director for release again
Mos@@ Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt incident , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which corruption was committed .
this was found by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money from public funds from Mozambique airports , whose advice Cam@@ b@@ aza was CFO between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good leadership and immediately requested his re@@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a statement by the General Prosecutor of the Republic , who had requested the application , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , since the company was not doing discipl@@ ines of discipl@@ ines .
however , many residents do not have the action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integrated ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to re@@ locate the director :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clearly illustrates the absence of transparency and is even a return step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
what we do to know is that the company also should have a discipl@@ ines of discipl@@ ines against the re@@ b@@ arians .
however , the company apparently said and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ ance social media , ref@@ uses this behaviour as well as &quot; rebellious &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , it would be advis@@ ors after he was sentenced to prison and had half of them to eat .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has in@@ filtr@@ ated to become re@@ integrated into the company that he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
resi@@ sted !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he promised him , I cannot believe that someone has been rewarded with such a way that the state has already been insul@@ ted so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza missing the mor@@ ality to serve and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , instead , serves himself only on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a handwritten money source and the state itself has become tired of this man , and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ Ãº@@ te fav@@ es it to remind the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief is in prison :
Die@@ be belongs to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mozambique is not only staying for ever as the first independent president of the Mozambique , but also as a sharp , conc@@ ision and - by next door - prophe@@ tic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man should be able to be able to sell his own amb@@ ition to his amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn off his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also opposed to :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was free .
and today , the company , with which he dis@@ agre@@ es , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - On Î±@@ dir ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , May 12 , 2017

Facebook is blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or co@@ her@@ age .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network received their posts from the net because they played the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people Eastern Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
fac@@ ebook is licensed by the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or of course . ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scrip@@ tures ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radic@@ ally nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely temp@@ oral con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speaking against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight anti @-@ hate language in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not inv@@ oke hate language .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use , were cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ eric words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same book@@ cases like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair at Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ users A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was extingu@@ ished today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , if she knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain , as he made a word play .
the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ urt is the opinion that they should be a radical nation@@ alists , however , also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ zing all of the posts , which is suspected of spreading rac@@ ism in the sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it fil@@ tering the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write to Fac@@ guard .
what to do instead , the post is carefully analysed and control it by checking the remaining words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) .
the good is that these three nation@@ alists who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate language , a rather good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the promotion may send a strong signal to all that hate hate language , the efficiency of this strategy is not long .
the experience of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship of impact often will start a cat and mouse game , whereby the user &apos;s social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ at &apos;s My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts , when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was attention to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and me the li@@ ken , post and sharing content is prohibited for 24 hours , because the mail &quot; Facebook community has not answered . &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of posts from people that have no negative int@@ entions , or simply try to show their opinions against them to speak radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate language :
post without Hass@@ tions of Facebook is removed .
in the post , the author divided its opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook is supposed to have done more than the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
to demonstrate such words , only even more hatred will bring within the different communities .
in addition , it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support , such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they were not attempted to report the fal@@ sely dissolved Po@@ sts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship is fed by users for a lot of don@@ ors .
instead of taking it seriously , users now rely on Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that have no hate language but nevertheless removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ eric text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and a pe@@ a cur@@ ry and a Indian movie .
just to try out if Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists who used social networks have increased to extend their voices and influence .
among other things , Hass@@ al is alleged to increase violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been responsible for his failure to talk to his bur@@ ial sites under control , critic@@ ised .
but instead of getting the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better running , rather focused on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is with the children &apos;s stay
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country unanimously decided to agree to the law that this practice is to offer , so that the married age is now at 18 .
prior to this change in marriage , there were several members of du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the religious groups ( IR@@ O ) , a group that representatives of the various religious groups of the country was gathered that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that , age , not the maturity of maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN child &apos;s legal prevention , the min@@ ors as , every man under 18 years &quot; defined .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 had already been married to Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were stri@@ ving to abol@@ ish laws on the children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the child before , they should not worry about their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition looked un@@ complicated for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some doubts came to whether the opposition would agree to the draft of the law .
but in early 2017 , the bill of the bill was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent which he contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree , and declare the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country issued a status update on Facebook which has once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s before was in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for that and no one decided against it .
after he had previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media user was thr@@ illed , because the laws have been changed for children before .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a prime minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it doesn &apos;t need much time and unnecessary g@@ ossi@@ p that has s@@ worn the core of the matter , but you know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that &apos;s almost every price .
while Abel was the opinion , there was definitely enough time to create the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , her@@ ra@@ ding news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who li@@ stens to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil social group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent from the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change of marriage was today , on 9 June 2017 , decided .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members , and 35 were present at the vote .
all the MPs , who were against the law , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s before is not permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ ky .
many thanks to all activists who have fo@@ aled him .
congratulations . congratulations .
thank you to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
before months Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a dis@@ col@@ oration of the law , said it was absolutely correct when Mahar@@ aj was going to act against the law , the majority of social media users would need to change the debate on the subject matter .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we say , instead of making the discussion as general , in a way that we invite you to speak to our bedroom , that the state that our daughters may protect against them , that they may possibly be ab@@ used by large , persistent men , would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legally legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they are sub@@ ordin@@ ated .

through the s@@ ke@@ wer of websites , Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the USA , internationally ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over one month , Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle of the en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
day for day , more significant , how important is the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as reporter and fans of TV @-@ series are fighting against the blocking .
although many studied Internet users are used to use add@@ ressing websites ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category .
although Turkey closed the article by Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University finds out regular block@@ ades of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world , when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) , which is not making a complete set of c@@ ens@@ orship .
the content is also available despite the legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS tells about his efforts :
after we heard the messages ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) we set everything to put snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ do org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step has been carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots and any live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ knock pe@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ sten similar Mir@@ ror pages when in particular country Wikipedia is closed .
Cons@@ onn@@ i told Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as employees at Mozilla Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it &apos;s not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you get to another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is of Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to make attention to the need for natural protection .
a pretty rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

permission used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad @-@ positioned moti@@ ves and well @-@ balanced colors .
that motivated him a camera to wear and try to op@@ pose the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nepal is trying to bring the international stage to the international stage .
and his home location right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife .
he described Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested from home when Navar@@ aj was suddenly called in Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
I ran immediately with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was found and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and want to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look like .
and he should know it , for he was able to face Tig@@ ers from face to face :
a tiger cannot inter@@ fere with the opinion of the sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also , because of darkness was on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately turns away , we look forward to and he star@@ red me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to make in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding car , Indian women for the first time to address the name of their husbands

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was released here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid women with greatest care , name of their husbands or even older men in the family .
instead , use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband due to the social pressure to respect the husband , and fear of the consequences they should have respect the norm in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ h@@ a , a pseu@@ dost@@ em and the family community , after having addressed a married relatives with his name .
the tradition of their wives also not name in the name is also common in men . however , they have much less assign@@ ments to fear if at all that , they shouldn &apos;t follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals and house@@ wives , represented a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss the habits of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and set up for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the network of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and runs this clubs .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them to the ambassador of the wall .
the first video that showed Ro@@ hin@@ i in their discussion , was of women who did not call their husbands at the name .
she decided for this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
according to the name of their husbands , it is a spectac@@ le that they pleaded not guilty to all obligations and never questioned .
Ro@@ hin@@ i writes :
this tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes for a long life .
a woman who does not hold this will be regarded as a sudden , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never had thought of this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning Ro@@ hin@@ i wanted to have never had her husband , so far , had never been called , at home , as it works .
she showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should call him by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Ro@@ hin@@ i started their first discussion sk@@ ies .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Ro@@ hin@@ i showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to take discussion with an exercise .
Ro@@ hin@@ i asked every participant in to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want us , means that they will not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Ro@@ hin@@ i Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands .
Ro@@ hin@@ i tells us :
a woman was so shy , that in the whole exercise only hur@@ ried out , and another decided to release all the fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ exchange on this , with an ancient spectac@@ le , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands at home .
and they held their word .
in the next days , Ro@@ hin@@ i received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Ro@@ hin@@ i , and asked what ideas she sat in the head : his wife could not cease to tell his name .
another dent member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law urged her , she got afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Ro@@ hin@@ i said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of participants in violence was less understand@@ able and the situation in violence .
Ro@@ hin@@ i reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as the carrying case of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the marriage status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he also tat@@ too .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I stopped to wear it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but mean , they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , discussion sk@@ lu@@ b is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; we do a trip with each discussion sk@@ lu@@ b .
usually , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to take care of women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the past few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes , they danced and sang about things which they had never made thoughts before .
Ro@@ hin@@ i says :
I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have some things , for example , like our ident@@ ities on our husbands , never said so honest .
it feels great to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group have carried s@@ worn only by Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ta @-@ c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they have not been comforted .
after much contro@@ versy and discussion on the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ ality linked to Sar@@ is and much more , decor@@ ate Ro@@ hin@@ i their own couple Cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that the women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Ro@@ hin@@ i is sure they will create it .
in the question , whether in the five months after their first discussion sk@@ ies , Ro@@ hin@@ i confirms that things are slowly coming into the rolls :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then again they stopped to tell the name of her husband .
some , included me , do not make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two shall continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women now bear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time .
the women in discussion @-@ lu@@ b know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ing around more freedom of movement or the own hand @-@ election - at the end of a difficult to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Ro@@ hin@@ i explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if any woman enters the club home and other people of it , what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

ch@@ ick @-@ headed men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that gl@@ itter@@ ing men could be in Mozambique &apos;s objective .

a new system of kidn@@ apping persons for the organ trading , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , probably wor@@ r@@ ying the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated , and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and reported in the result that the bodies of the sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a bald man could un@@ fold or riches , the police declared of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of educ@@ ators for ob@@ sc@@ ure uses are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN has led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with alco@@ hol@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have planned to go into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are travelling to Mozambique are the aim of rit@@ ual attacks , the mos@@ Mozambique police warned of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the alleg@@ ations took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ mam in the South of Mozambique , said that the local police have already taken the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman is involved in the death of gl@@ itter@@ ing men .
the persecution and murder of serious individuals for the extraction and the sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , for probably super@@ st@@ itious rit@@ ual , has given the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bet@@ ting ( PR@@ M ) , who also exist that a belief existed , according to which the victims have power in the head , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days , three men were murdered with hair @-@ fail@@ ures in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha told Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers poor S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , who interpreted that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty of which Mozambique is facing :
I would like to ask GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , TH@@ E@@ I am ashamed of a country where people would feel ashamed to make sex against good notes , and other achievements , a nation in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ itter@@ person for super@@ st@@ itious purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to target and to reach their wealth .
despite the integrity of the phenomena , some have the opportunity for ma@@ bl@@ ren humor .

a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in it to expand access to the public and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in the Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bass@@ els wife N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been cont@@ acted by persons who became as the insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information prize .
Bass@@ els stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) unknown , as N@@ oura from Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and future , we point all the pro@@ cure of Bas@@ sel as a pioneer of the Open Web Movement .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o received attention in international community attention after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for cancer of cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endang@@ ering ) , following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us Case as &quot; an internal affair &quot; and a speaker tells , he considered &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
however , China is still receiving calls from international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , release or permit a treat abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely exposed to the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Liu .
a speaker , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should practice pressure to enable Liu in foreign countries abroad .
Norway
the Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ end have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway got into the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2010 , although the Norwegian government had announced that this ultimately had nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December of last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement in order to res@@ ume the salmon trip to China , as the exports were mostly blocked since 2010 .
after receiving the message that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought up his hope to an unconditional release , and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was unable to op@@ pose his price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to help him to seek medical assistance where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called on China for the release of Li@@ us , as she ha@@ sted in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife , as well as family members .
they should meet all visits and receive , they desire , and be able to communicate free with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , unless it is to help him with his satisfaction . &quot;
speaking in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the news agency was announced on 27 June that the embassy was released by the Chinese authorities , not just Liu , but also to free his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the response to the US embassy was a li@@ king response from China to itself , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to join in and un@@ answered questions about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple that China should offer :
protection and freedom , such as travel integrity and access to medical care of his choice , which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push and release Liu and his wife .
I challenge China to release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , in order to provide a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin that Liu explains all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking , the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns , whether the host of Liu could cause a visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide an adequate medical care to provide providing an appropriate medical care and giving him the opportunity to make himself away from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP earlier that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police will always visit the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls for China to compulsory international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old the rights of these rights .
France
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , independent where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news conference France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out if France should end up .
Taiwan
the Council of the Festival in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Liu and a major tolerance to those who require peaceful funds to challenge political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator of the ruling party Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u also called for China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed up in an explanation on June 28 around Liu very worried and gave him that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that the initiatives that he took , and for which he had been punished , would have led to a harmon@@ ious , stable and wealthy of their China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who inspired Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore was considered to be a city .
this note has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting of a meeting at the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people go wrong .
I tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifice , this valuable country to create , you can say that we finally have no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had an escape in front of the responsibilities , a must viol@@ ate .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons presented by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in view of which he appeared in@@ so@@ lic@@ ally un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike cities that are lead to a party permanently .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old cor@@ er from the authorized mach@@ inations that indicate the Democrats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the end of last week Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our it@@ di@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he warned them with non @-@ Ans@@ wer @-@ ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our advert@@ ised K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point if it was highly paid to be part of the town of Singapore .
by rele@@ asing his comment on the blog , he shows concerning the critics that you should start to read the entire co @-@ address of the conference , in order to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a town , and no country .
read the address .
as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ easier , even if we are looking forward to free and just elections .
he delighted Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades ? ) .
as he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an reveals his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is a leader of a growing generation , such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice spoke in Singapore very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de what I expected - should I agree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , right and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review sets the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; have committed a mistake , or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country go to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabin , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do not defend their military service , but do not defend their own country ?
who must pay tax invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ?
in fact , the Journey of a Dec@@ ade concerning the year of birth , Singapore is and always a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have injured many of the people ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right .
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for short his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect at your home location or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and a different Fac@@ ets should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; and I will answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on what situation is taking place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his conversation partner by taking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook even inn@@ u@@ rous of anger , if they are kept for Americans , but not bo@@ thered me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian player from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian banner well visible on their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans ... .
so it was already when I started traveling through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the march of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always borne small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gay mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be regarded as the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as such types south of the border .
we are Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it would make me nothing , if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly : as &quot; nice &quot; signi@@ fies , is basically to be s@@ cour@@ ier - as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , soft , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has a very own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can encounter .
harmless , is in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to make no attention .
this can be something good when you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ rite of things that pass around one around .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a prime minister of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ as listed as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we l@@ acks warm heart@@ ed , open kindness , whom I connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada just a sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a music video published in Thailand , which led the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert who took power in 2014 and restore the civil government in spite of their promises to recover the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend his girl@@ friend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , this was shared on Facebook highly charged video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Lik@@ es .
last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists opened the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular it is concerned with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta regime .
look at the videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand have been prosec@@ uted for the last three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ kon@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which was given the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the host absolute decision on important national themes .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; integration process &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed from the Jun@@ ta as a critic .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations often used by the authorities to unite activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , supervised by the online content and individuals who accused of having sl@@ ander@@ ed the monarchy and prosec@@ utes the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict view against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ Ã¤t@@ tis ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the law was declared war in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup of the Army .
one of the problems continuing the Jun@@ ta continues to buy their decision to buy expensive underground boats , although security experts war@@ n them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax rights .
in the video , even as people will be thrown into a black supplier , before you put them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and us@@ us@@ men us@@ ury , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the team members of the band members who used the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during protests in 2014 .

the following articles , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC Media website and is published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war company is re@@ covering very slowly in East @-@ Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ adas are located in the coal tank of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , Russians and abor@@ tions live in the area .
these settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these vul@@ can@@ als .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased after a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story resi@@ du@@ es of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ ko@@ w@@ kas are symbo@@ lic@@ ally standing for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls to him hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speaking ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , who served all the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
people who once lived on this site and made their contribution to the central planning management of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile .
about fifty inhabitants live in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas that still accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take us photograph@@ ing , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girls p@@ lowed something of her friend , and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to come across the rounds .
the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that they instead supported their young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives .
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells us that they and other vill@@ agers attempt to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this - everybody is busy with its own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls her aun@@ t G@@ alya to her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .
I have prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , it reminds of the village stain@@ s before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just collapsed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we bought country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) recently .
we want to build a house there , but this will take a little bit , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband works in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ash@@ as kinder@@ garten once found , they keep pigs , cows , ham@@ mer@@ ing and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost their fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation comes to the end , a small boy is running to us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hiding .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts behind him .
he plays with the ball , who then roll down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ it the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , ensuring un@@ certainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts in their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico .

this article from Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
in the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a coral pink spectac@@ le frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy shape form .
it is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , removable walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ ired migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the top part of the coast to call her : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you in Africa ? . &quot;
at the time , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she would not like to reject .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , massage them with a bal@@ m that are exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jog@@ ging mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to re@@ locate her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other guides of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel along the way together and that Afri@@ kaner already speak on What@@ s@@ App by Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his leading companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and football world championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez contact .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother , and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always remain in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us that their guests are often sending text messages when they have continued to post her , or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought their hands to prepare chickens as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope to travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valencia and his family stayed in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ick@@ ets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he began to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking facility outside .
Valencia explains that he knows what the guests make .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his working site from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula is coming from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted money to make money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a all @-@ one , has offered him the roof .
a few months later the family lives still , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the gears consult the travelers quietly their teleph@@ ones .
a small bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away .
like a proud Grand@@ mother , she ut@@ ters her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s who made their clientele , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers know more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she asks her for a short time .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ sions &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ in@@ jiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
check @-@ out Point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users
the inhabitants of X@@ in@@ jiang , a ethnic minority region in Western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the City Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile phone message in which it shows the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
in the notification , the app will be said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities were able to use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they had shortly after having installed the App , messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the notification made by the police that the app determine the sources and the distribution ways of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users att@@ enti@@ vely , how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors are to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can naturally be used in diverse ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; remote players or even h@@ acker may be manipul@@ ating the home network of a person or steal out of it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China most often focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote regions like X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet .
to limit the un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme interest and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet connections .
based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( production , production news in China ) showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were then over@@ checked if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you have discovered an check@@ point with one device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( derived from the number of course ) , the software published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can raise the identification requirements of a Windows operating system , and thus avoiding un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ in@@ jiang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities , and the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computer and communications equipment .
a current report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights Organisation , mentioned this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ in@@ jiang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs who register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks , and media cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible action , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in an Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and make sure you &apos;re very alone in one place where all the important is disappeared .
everything has been revealed and dis@@ solves and a truth reveals that it is clearly recognis@@ able , both inside and outside .
one that makes all honor their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you climb the reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt , in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the storm . you will clear that you are here between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough so that I did not form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Council formed it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he introduced his power to us by giving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were carried out during a peaceful protests like the we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to carry out the city the darkness of the night with &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
all the town was cov@@ eted , not my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a town , which up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their complic@@ es .
in the third night things had a little soo@@ thes after the power supply had to work in the neighborhood .
I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through the st@@ illness .
few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied us to a splendid picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled all .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t look at anything .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military safety building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can you swal@@ low - nothing can return to you , after you gave them all the way to the office of security services from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men . my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to shout if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ filled eyes looked upon me .
&quot; and you dream of what to look to me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was in my fool@@ is@@ hness , vanity ; maybe in the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to look forward to your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with it . &quot;
the tank of this flu@@ ffy is mine , until today , in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ atic torture that I was exposed to months .
I out@@ ward the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I bear with myself .
afterwards again through the yard and the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells .
I have all the details exactly before I &apos;m interested in the room .
otherwise , they have assigned a larger cell for me this time .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may sit down immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I grab@@ bed a well @-@ proven communication method : to strike with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ eses &quot; was .
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prestigious man middle age , which is similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness you don &apos;t know any distinctive fac@@ tions , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers vern@@ s its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the major cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would che@@ er him if I remain .
liar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which l@@ utes the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear it still &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of the per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the che@@ wing in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under &quot; , play on the 13th S@@ ure of Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
that was the secret to protect and prevent the state security against us and to prevent the terrorist situation in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ we@@ gian dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal replacement card and ri@@ ver@@ ted the strict view of the world &apos;s view .
this is not a house , here is no country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ enz to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I am interested in the hearing and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that were astonished at him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin with your life , as you can join this day and to protest at the end that soon will be an end . &quot;
I do not answer .
I used it to me , not to answer .
I can really not say exactly what ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me to be a good communication agent .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me to be punished or bad , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
an sentence in all its diversity .
its command is to pl@@ uck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly confession of confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ry@@ man kill@@ eth on your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my scre@@ ams are not yet enough , why they cast the tube through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present us , from their sight , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them changed , whereas I was still in the row .
I had lost all my body in my body - and also my voice , which I heard cry out .
the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling down , and found no pleasure in it , why he grab@@ bed the next to a electrically charged rod .
electricity flows my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect electricity manager .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to put my sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , that came to me as minutes .
then call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fil@@ s the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I reply with the voice of an exhausted young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make dre@@ ad@@ able sorrow . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ ib sp@@ ends the most of his time ; sometimes he fell on his screen , to his computer , and again at his couch again .
but to what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers , or his with nic@@ ot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house that belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activist who was transferred to the conservative majority and their alt@@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , often deals with topics such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian conflict . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown Amman relevance , but also in towns , which from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as someone who is not fully restricted in his mind by limits to people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not profit it openly , he h@@ itting a special incl@@ ination against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian conflict of the second generation &quot; - so he himself describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and never before Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ da@@ ib .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water sol@@ dered nest cafe in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , to fa@@ sten sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ ing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the cas@@ ein of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose are primarily associated with freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under free sk@@ ies , especially when you throw a look into the neighboring countries .
therefore , it simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as in public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to not land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the country is contradic@@ ted , cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table be .
the MP and former press leaders in the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b spoke in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled &quot; because of sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vism , which represent the approved legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila considers the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to stand out &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply a sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs plant .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib resi@@ sted traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ i@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an evi@@ dently ill @-@ unknown woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them they should trust .
in the past years , the number of &quot; Ehren@@ mor@@ de &quot; has increased - the un@@ official outside is left .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing , for women who have become victims of violence or domestic violence .
according to a law for frag@@ ile control from 1954 , women who are subject to the risk of in@@ corporate violence , &quot; and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman will not happen .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to dis@@ miss topics that are in the country long as tab@@ u .
H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , is that he could separate his music , which is full of explic@@ it announ@@ cements on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was in@@ timi@@ dated in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib occupies the question after Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically active in the core , can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the further course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want , &quot; whether it is faith or non@@ belief , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still being cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and been cen@@ sored .
on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a processed version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als is not speaking to Islam .
he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ er@@ otic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ das , who was later to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century openly could write about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan be that ?
the real problem , as H@@ da@@ ib , did nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom it is nothing new , that government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the just@@ ification that they would have expressed serious problems with the problems associated with the deep in the country .
in view of what is the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Opinion , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is an independent g@@ utter and take a show for him . Jordan has stopped for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it sees h@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , reas@@ oned and inner changes . it is safe to take these changes from day to day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ ib dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , of a Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he is not just dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of a real and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , scattered un@@ itions and artificial type of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes it .
until the time is done , H@@ da@@ ib is ra@@ ging and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually over in August in many regions of To@@ ho@@ cus , and from a period come , in the armies of Japan invaded the northeast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi in force .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are straight to see .
nonetheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only True - and a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care were so important as in this story , because they are helping to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic centre of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate where road@@ side and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 , that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , and thus also the sophisticated hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ ers such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Brazil ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to that there will always be more normal citizen into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers who can make this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts at each other in order to show who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks like you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitors can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people to convince her weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice a training in hair@@ dresser , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the potential opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession currently being in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year in March , and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : Liebes@@ letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the article &quot; love messenger of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which has published international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more import@@ antly , people who have fallen out to op@@ pose aff@@ ection ?
the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation was not inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Recon@@ structive aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encour@@ ages letters to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the sub@@ ordin@@ ation of the Peace Treaty was considered to be so important that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
however , in front of the column there is still a long way , until you can talk about an acting reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , had been exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric and around the clock in the clock , they have to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian Society in turn , which had become acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant oppression , and in some cases of deep hatred for gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that young colum@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and had to help with the integration process .
and exactly that they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - that will then be transmitted personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people we love to write on the Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those forgot who need much more necessary .
he plan , he told us further , in this year his love with people sharing the most urgent additives .
thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC which now have to build their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters are prepared to make the dis@@ course of a history of war to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all bigger cities , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN warehouse in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ ver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ kind traveled to the camp to take the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC emerged as they had done before , to op@@ pose the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of sub@@ sist@@ ence of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between &quot; , told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Board of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience so :
after we had handed over the letters , a former fighters led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of tent where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him there was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the village .
and I asked him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something like a nice , therefore I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him completely , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was never expected to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a company outside there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I &apos;ve only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion lap .
the students were all raised as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced , how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country just fair .
for a goal of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who had never found hearing , had no electoral law , and to recognize that the people who I often had seen as a monster , and even hate people who were turned around through their lives and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men , even those who have killed , have done so much harm to give us something , and give a smile and embrace .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ ano@@ ve , Archbishop of the city Cal@@ i , the following letter :
column has been made , that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to raise the weapons and to protest against their rights , and that is totally justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that &apos;s why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they listen - all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution , and bring victims , because we know from their own experience that nothing is easy . in those of us who defend life as foundation of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman speaks about the persec@@ utions in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya and the life from Kad@@ y@@ row

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in Caucas@@ ian region are subject to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and compres@@ sors .
with terr@@ ors , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about persecution gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ash value over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only developed over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared with us some of their experiences and talked about what is happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports published , which were issued against the to@@ wing , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , susp@@ ects the susp@@ icious men and found them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , her consci@@ ously became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for them , so they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens had learned from the gender equality of their land woman , the hunt for Sabrina was opened .
fear for her life , she moved the final end of the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that somebody needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was stuck in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot; then there is no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya that can remove these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos taken from my documents through the whole of What@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was in doing just a few days from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honour the family , you sc@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last final in the hospital .
apparently , some women had taken everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
at the hospital , I learned that I had two no@@ str@@ ils in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances have you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , foreigners , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to return to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya to prove that this was a lie .
they ordered the absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it up without through the roads ; others wanted me to go up in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and I say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic .
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much , and she placed a stro@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into a apartment and already a few hours later under the window , a car with dark windows and a license plate with 95 points .
after the third time , it was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends were checked by the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I will say that I remember all of them , they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without a sign without a reference , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you were in safety , just because you left the country ?
you know , in which hotel you see . they even know your room number .
just to prove you , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , but this is a tab@@ ular theme .
some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements I still bear in me .
so very I wish it , this se@@ atic barrier can &apos;t be overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I don &apos;t give myself effort to look like the person from their past - so my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
what to do your friends , those who have stayed in ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I had updated information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I talked with someone who gave the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told , that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an was not arrested and tortured and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he completed a new wave .
most likely they become concentr@@ ating on family and family now .
thus , my I , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by the blood of satisfaction .
OC Media : are now gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says that there were just not many .
if , then , especially those who have not enough relatives , or those of their relatives have been left to set Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be held there so they can later present themselves as terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they were attacked in any village or a military base .
you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this only one assumption or have you a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m just getting someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
since then there was nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them .
and so called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken .
but until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were no reports so far . we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else could it not be allowed to shave this man ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who have heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , had already been held in the past ?
Sabrina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Gros@@ ny when I was living there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was more secure than now .
Russia originally intended to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation , &quot; but ultimately led us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : what is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had coloured eyel@@ ash , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the security Ministry of the Sch@@ aria has never been curved to me only .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ asing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otto is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children , when they are funny about sick .
OC Media : so they just shut her eyes before you , because they thought you were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ asing and never been beaten .
OC Media : how long did these gifts lead ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row joined the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality in television .
he didn &apos;t talk about us , but priority over women &apos;s behavior .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the meantime I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic fell steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you go right now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
apart from that , I still works as activist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I comment with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , coll@@ ars , I gi@@ fted them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards .
I do not reach a p@@ enny .
I discovered these people myself , when I ap@@ per@@ ate listen@@ ers .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a bite ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
so , nature , that has pure nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Che@@ chens who want to do with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no vibrations in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have Kab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , who also have Russians ; on all the planet it gives them - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , therefore it is un@@ pleasant to hear , so what to hear .
I meet so many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and fa@@ sten during the Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know many thinking about Tran@@ sid@@ ental men to men who love men , and they believe that you have changed his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ ation .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different living settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not feel ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I become so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not at all at all - I know that I am myself now .
local groups war@@ n prior to an increase of self mor@@ nings within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ ality .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Community in Iran that is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra , in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that can rise to in@@ ability to his family , such as Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to remain in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube , held the moments after he had lit himself , firmly .
some people made it fast to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ ra hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burning were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Jama@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists warned against the place that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ha@@ Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hanged himself .
their stories have one thing common : there were all the family fathers , who , due to the persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to feed their families and pursue their safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ community living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute its habit@@ ats .
in front of a century , the Arab Jama@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and under@@ took major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most sustainable and most precious areas of agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy also develops slowly , and the indigenous population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ fle@@ ction .
the Iranian regime refused to pursue jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ es , the waters of the Arab lands in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are diver@@ ted .
these dem@@ me have only led to destroy devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are searching for a school , completed a secondary school and completed 45 % of a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self mor@@ ality among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse compared to unemployment . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z newly @-@ coming ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deduc@@ ted access to working opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their life beyond their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to Ah@@ wa@@ zi , as even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated at work , because the speaking of Arabic language or the carrying of Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances given that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , strike human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ aking up and knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; why don &apos;t I identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react , especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
she wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even imag@@ ined scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money despite the same education as men .
that women still stand under str@@ ingent observation , if it is about what they may do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women are sooner or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ aci@@ dic blanket , and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is conscious of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black females in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I speak , on which kind of femin@@ ist and verb@@ al ab@@ used , many white femin@@ ists left and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they all agree that women - all women should come together to meet their voices and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing , to achieve the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an inter @-@ nation@@ alized violence , that we have black women to be exposed to two times .
or about that , black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and hospitals are less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black Sp@@ are and women with a migration background exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership , than white women .
on the other hand , I want all men , all men , and all men , nor skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t use the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ just@@ ices in their thinking , which relate to gender than even on the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ elling that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs to advance their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to get white women the importance of over@@ coming skin color and gender . because some of them continue to hold the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women a home and ren@@ ounce themselves from the white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer it to get me completely and get rid of femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and we will be able to provide us in the gap we will be created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana &apos;@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after having read these lines , please inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I still exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither over@@ thrown , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will again be published here .
Nabil Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in the can@@ oe - with a special issue caused by the region of Kurdistan in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I definitely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost as I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ art@@ ender Alliance - who is preparing and to protect the rivers , streams , and water ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a combines the pressures and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key , a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist , produced in Er@@ bil .
the emphasis on their work is followed , some significant sub@@ cultures , and the use of co@@ operative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help of supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their ways .

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by tur@@ f . the article belongs to the number # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ en@@ e@@ Women ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons .
a police officer told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent as violent .
since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the complete display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not benefit .
a few days later the second wife moved back to her ad .
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women , it is difficult .
if women have given an ad at all , they generally have no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit victims of violence to be victims of law en@@ forcement agencies .
maintenance 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and Stati@@ stic 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a Legal System , which No@@ thing Un@@ n@@ imm@@ t@@ 3 of the laws : good approach , lack of implem@@ ent@@ ations and statistics
it &apos;s difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a research scientist at the Centro de Document@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ gy@@ ms , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that are not even an@@ sat@@ in to show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District Office of the Prosecutor dropped 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertis@@ ements due to domestic violence at the peac@@ ekeeping . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the read@@ ings , 40 % of women said they were physically abuse , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics show not the true magn@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women minister , Ana Ba@@ i@@ ar@@ di will actually appear only a few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; for any woman who im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
on every woman who im@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women come to do this , &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the prosecution authorities can not adequ@@ ately documented how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women of women in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , a woman died because of violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which does not under@@ take nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but afterwards , however , this should always regret it for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but two years she carried the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe :
I never thought I would have been victims of abuse .
when I read earlier this , I thought that only women come to sub@@ jection , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook , in which they described its ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric if he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to see that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users surveyed Mari@@ ana , why they had dropped from Carlos for so long , and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had ma@@ iled her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner was finally able to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to strike them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as Advert@@ ise with the authorities without earnings and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able jur@@ ist struggle between Paraguay and her homeland , where it was mainly around money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lacking conversion
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not being applied .
the ad@@ missions of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a path of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , looks great problems with the use of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ e@@ llas ( # Fear ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Una@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ ager ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the bill is to explain the Fem@@ ale d to a strange crime @-@ continu@@ ance and tou@@ g@@ her as it is the case in neighbouring countries , Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to also win the MPs to the law that , in order that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are currently being prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison .
the bill has provided , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) travel costs that have to carry out the victims of violence even if they just want to refund and secure a safe accommodation .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial funds for this :
in Paraguay is seen mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment as a part of human relationships .
here , an outline will take place , so violence is no longer considered a slightly different .
who is silent in view of these facts , making him guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we must restore that long way , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had changed . in fact , parts of the law had been canc@@ eled . among other things , a passage that the partners began to reconc@@ ile the partners in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack its victims again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law does not apply as a great set@@ back .

an independent media in Oman one year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to ban attacks
&quot; this website was locked due to a decision of the information minister , &quot; is on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before court , but later they returned .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn &apos; in Oman , who came to power after he had lost his father , Said i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a state of state .
since then , in addition to its role as the only Sultan , the principal eth@@ ites in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , chief commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme National Bank for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the s@@ ult@@ ans of the s@@ ult@@ ans is characterized by the ass@@ har@@ dy efforts of security forces , in particular the public liberties , including freedom of freedom , viol@@ ets and human rights defence , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ nation .
the authorities have systematically mis@@ chief and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , including activists in mind , their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure , and the recruitment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which since its creation in 2007 was reported over corruption in Oman ( a absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , Security Council Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Security , arrested by Az@@ am@@ n , who had appeared in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to tie hands on judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; in this , there was corruption in the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary and the mixture of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited to the Special Department , and was arrested on his arrival of security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the Deputy Chief Editor , You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who worked as Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed on in@@ definite period after the information ministers had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online , banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were convicted of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ excav@@ ation of the State of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of infr@@ in@@ gement of an audience and sl@@ ander guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es at a height of 3000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a year@@ ling professional ban against the two journalists were hanged .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after using the use of an information grid for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
at Al Abr@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set on 22 August 2016 , and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , and sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after closing his six month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his sentence in prison .
the Appeals Court also emphas@@ ised the decision of the Ministry of Education , to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks after the attacks were subjected to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister introduced a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court , the publication of the newspaper again .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where it was hurt in Oman at the recent times .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ wat@@ in and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operation .
due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive injury of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ an authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper to create , so that their journalists can work on their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country , and
4 . to ensure that human rights defended and journalists killed their righ@@ tful human rights work in Oman and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial kill@@ ings .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the demand on site @-@ run medical research there are two reasons : for a lack in the offer of global health services , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact in the poo@@ rest countries of Africa far more serious effects as elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists itself , will only be able to develop its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Expl@@ oration of Inf@@ ection in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media on these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private owner ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is based on research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion of the important current knowledge issues in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we just put solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recipi@@ ents instead of being mo@@ ver .
the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it &apos;s difficult to find people who come back or come here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need to special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of the world , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the values of access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
the system shows that magazines are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : as &quot; open source &quot; seed producers to change worldwide food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports on solution for environmental issues worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on breed already in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as the red@@ dish , the first plant , cultivated by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was made only by his own int@@ oler@@ ance and the question of how many salads he can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more salads were patented , and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or lam@@ inated leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been signed on more plants such as cereal or cart@@ oning , because of this trends , plant bree@@ ders , environmental protection and atomic facts provide food security to the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on still pic@@ ks a salad , but he now needs longer , since its work is always worth more restrictions .
&quot; it &apos;s like the rock I &apos;d like to lie in a river in order to pull out .
so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a rup@@ ture with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think this patents go too far too far .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad , because all characteristics are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he would like .
in doing so , however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal at the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in &quot; Green@@ house House &quot; from the station and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bree@@ ders are permanently usable .
as part of the initiative , in short O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bree@@ ders may under@@ take that others can be used seeds free of them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to sell shops and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders allow others to cross their seed , to avoid such own varieties , and not immediately contam@@ inate - two aspects that are banned by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i executive board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger associations such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably productive vegetables , should also know that the species is bred on farms , such as this vegetable is bred , is threatened .
food sovereign without seed @-@ sovereign people is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to provide other seeds free to provide them free . thus , its approach is opposed to patented seeds and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is at risk because the available Gen@@ pool due to the ever more abundant intellectual property rights on plant material , which therefore always be restricted , un@@ paved .
Claire Lu@@ by , the Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ants are protected as intellectual property , thereby it is not even difficult for plant bree@@ ders either .
for other plants , there are such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ less con@@ genital plants are patented as wheat in even greater style , as a salad or carrots .
a question of view
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such that their taste or color improves up to such as they thri@@ ve in particular environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents based on plant properties prove that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is increasing by more patents . genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever since the changing conditions are much worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaking in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to proves that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States , the company has set up the company for maintaining the genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property may include other bree@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties of innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expired .
often , these instructions are often help to come with another method for the same result .
such protection is not in@@ hib@@ ited to innovation , but helps it to be provided by public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks like this : 20 years to wait until a patent strap , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed in plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general good condition and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to simpli@@ fy farmers .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we don &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on does not inter@@ fere with the concept to patented other plant characteristics : &quot; we are not creating the characteristics .
the plants form them , and as a bree@@ der , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ ders in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever seeks a variety , will chast@@ ise his own values in them .
those who believes on the industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , who are required to grow mass@@ aging of her@@ b@@ icides , are breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very genetically . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents are creating the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either do they reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bree@@ ders would be innovative by avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than company that patented .
I need to be constantly new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years of age , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is 20 years long before competition , with what you feel very nice . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US appears to be a leader in the &quot; open source , &quot; the concept has meanwhile spread rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes themselves as professional organisation in the field of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . for the preser@@ vation of traditional crops , the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell its own .
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l has been working on a &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; License , which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from land to land , which is not easy to use one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . this makes it possible against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents to be admitted to the conventional far@@ med plants .
however , there is no law yet ; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the sponsor@@ ing of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &quot; Program for &quot; Open Source , &quot; seed @-@ based systems currently declares that the organisation should be a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for scheduled next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development aid groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organisation organisation US@@ C Canada and Con@@ centr@@ ation Group ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , which publishes a global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid organisations like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to contribute to seed and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection between the Lu@@ by from O@@ ss@@ i hopes it will soon be able to know more people soon .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has thought out , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now attemp@@ ting to make people clear that there is still more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of the 5th August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the National Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on that .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , where it was critic@@ ised by the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the W@@ Network for Human Rights Information Re@@ quired - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution to defend their goal , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I , it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was not so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the blocking , and not give up . we hope to continue our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the shaft of the wave trap for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and Human Rights Research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government of the Egyptian government , even goal of aggression .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ adas , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 and recorded a video as the police had exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly turning around politics and human rights issues in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada utter@@ ed at the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
to lock the blogs , however , is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the bar@@ ge of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for me for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to con@@ vey the feeling of a siege to me ; a arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I took it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mud are going to end up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities blocked technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by converting to internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice points to the intention of the government to block and fil@@ tering contents , which might have access to the Egyptian users .
the situation will also be dimin@@ ished , that the decision @-@ decisions are made behind closed doors , thereby reducing the Egyptian population no legal basis with which it can proceed in front of judgment against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

day for day reports newspapers with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous Post@@ card designs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Each second day is a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rob@@ ber@@ y pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an ang@@ ulated financial situation , the power of violence in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision said the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ ver@@ breaking , etc . everything that happened from the civili@@ zed standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the &quot; War &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes from the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Chief Editor &apos;s Editor , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that did not recognise the war .
in the same video , journalist of the newspaper , that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas will be controlled by crimin@@ als .
in the article , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when he is dist@@ orted , it can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who sho@@ ots , and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and struggle against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
does the term &quot; War &quot; benefit from it more than them ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , according to a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to draw responsibilities regarding the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - how to be shown at the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ adequate investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ counterfeit failure of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than only its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is false according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country .
no of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is on rank 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company South America , which is emphas@@ ized as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , repe@@ ats the state policy of the state policy since years .
to these security policy measures also belonged to U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a Fav@@ ela police force and station@@ ed a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP took control over the poor communities , who should be protected from the curious police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made out of one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for human beings .
because this calls for the state to use the means and to use the typical for a war . to this , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ damage &quot; and &quot; wi@@ thered balls . &quot;

source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Romanian organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding , Homs , D@@ eir Y@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
in particular , the region East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons called the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was pract@@ ised by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these alleg@@ ations have been controlled by rebels outside Damascus under siege , which led to that inhabitants have reli@@ ed on local or tun@@ nels and control points .
due to the lon@@ gla@@ sting block@@ ade , traditional food products such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to conventional , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their foods makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the right to the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French News Agency AFP :
&quot; we opted for cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that had been fighting for three years now that this project had been announced and pushed his relief , that it now wins more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families of knowledge of plant@@ ations to con@@ vey to Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have reached over 100 % of the expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations up to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of fuel short@@ ages , the fuel produced from plastics are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began to produce their quality from the regions of the regions , before they checked up their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . as this was able , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a bigger movement .
&quot; we want to teach human beings for various reasons &quot; : breakdown of the siege .
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency ( such as paper , tea , coffee beans , cardboard , etc ) are used for extraction of new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities which are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible .
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese call for justice to the victims of 2017
several hundred people protest on 21 October in many neighbour@@ hoods in Portugal and called righteousness for the victims of the fires that erup@@ ted in the north of Portugal in the week .
two and forty people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ fighters that spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June Pe@@ dr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande was a similar tragedy in Pe@@ dr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system that monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , in 2017 alone around 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
in order to make you a better picture of Ernst the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users divided pictures :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread out on the web and show images that allow better insights into the event :
the see@@ able tragedy
the target of the Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people surveyed why the civilian protection was not able to im@@ pose the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al of the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pe@@ dr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did this Sunday : there are dozens of reports of open roads , surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could happen in June , as the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will be challenged at high bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko at high bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a far @-@ sufficient proposal for the whale @-@ form , which had brought the government after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was growing by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applicant suffered from funds to self protection , that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val goes on the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environment @-@ organization Quer@@ cus made it attentive that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of slightly bu@@ stible wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , continues to spread the fires of this species .
these problems are added to these issues that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when people were seeking information or attempted to contact members offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire@@ fighters in October , so that the servers of the majority of the 400,000 users who followed fires , the site had not counted more than half a million .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban .
two years ago a terrible civil war erup@@ ted between the different Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the Province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan during the last time with his family at dinner together .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time so she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning of dawn , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara disappeared suddenly .
the Taliban was getting closer to their hatred to the Haz@@ ara well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ is@@ ru@@ be . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took that which was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a strange country along with other refugees and to@@ wed bags with mort@@ ar , the heavier than he himself , to make his life .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we suspended nylon before the open window , so that we don &apos;t work out at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
on the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , running alone by the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice the day of food in charity .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high demand rates a type of second chance for emp@@ tied asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true , however , that conditions to find asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astro@@ phic .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; special entrance centers &quot; in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission center if they have officially put an application for asylum - which can still be drawn after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers .
until then there are people who do not have money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his stub@@ born lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af soon to free himself from these conditions .
after having made various work in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af had its entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel , and opened a Schn@@ el@@ lim@@ b after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the topic of the &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for March 24 , 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghanistan operated companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of its restaurant Orient , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is nar@@ rated by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the story of their trip to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also stand in Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , far beyond the Italian restaurant business and retail stores and targets to the country that he had to leave forced dis@@ counted as teenagers .
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily , if I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and must get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also decor@@ ates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preservatives . &quot; so they can sell their yields on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey myself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : draft decisions made out of Egypt allow social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in detention .
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , who prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill to see that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority .
users would have to use to use social networks , within six months after the successful legisl@@ ature order on the website of the authority using their complete name as well as their ID number .
those who negle@@ ct this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or of the termination of a criminal payment .
the law , which was recruited by sixty parliamentary members , is currently being deb@@ ated to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
a further Member of Dep@@ uties filed a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced to the har@@ dening of the pre@@ sidents or a high officials .
under Egyptian law , the de@@ vot@@ ion of pre@@ sidents and government institutions should already be pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the bill of law , a such act would act with prison and fin@@ es , right experts at Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would have been a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom already exists in danger for many years .
an striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographers Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , who demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators that led against the military coup that led to the counter@@ part of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a court date .
recently , his sentence was post@@ pon@@ ed on the 20th May , because the prison term , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the court hall .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ dost@@ ems , illeg@@ ally gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ fac@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists of tra@@ ced documents
may , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , provided by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , provided by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption . official amnesty would be provided that all of them would return to the jurisdiction .
the document published on 21 April at the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , raises a light on how the preventive plans look like to support the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia , rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press conference , which journalists will protect the right to protecting their sources .
nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China force to force social media using social media ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the user need social media in China prior to write messages in social media or share .
in the regulations , in addition , registration is required to be required by the full real name .
analy@@ st suspect that this cause is to be achieved in the social networks by the Eli@@ min@@ ation of anonymous Comments on social networks . it is un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens proposed to be proposed in social media to protect these regulations only to protect citizens journ@@ alism and independence .
let &apos;s see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia closed access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or We@@ chat , the state government will register as &quot; organizer of the information common . &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government to organize a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make responsible services responsible for removing content and force them on request for suspension user data .
these websites are currently websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ d@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the blocking of Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles that support Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication has been locked , the site was locked up because they collabor@@ ated with &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to establish a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is thus , besides among others , China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can not stop to smile
after this week , the government &apos;s government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with an targeted surveillance provider that would provide internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and alert programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
however , the government has cons@@ ul@@ ted a telecommunications company and secret services relating to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , consultation still runs until 19th May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior .
