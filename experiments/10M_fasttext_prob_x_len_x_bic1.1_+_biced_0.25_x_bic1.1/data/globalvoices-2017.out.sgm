<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have danced to American music, American writers and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was a journalist for the American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporters, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-Student, who were the Supreme Court with judges who were willing to occupy its interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year, which I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of same minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the tourist hostility and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with its narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he says, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroe and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes that he won with the Republican preelections, was the highest number ever achieved by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic programme, the people from around the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps universe did not agree with the initiative by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I struggling with Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace, and helped me to accustom us to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">Those people and those who embodies the values kept my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump traveled towards the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they shared either his racism and fanatism, or because they were willing to overlooked these things, almost the heart collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to signify the trump voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">To assign the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficially and respectful and suggests a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this electorate, of which most are white, voted for Trump, because they want to restore control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks different with contempt upon those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (with regard to the White vs. all other ethnicities, "Word play from white in play on the White and Whiplash, which means so much means skidling trauma), as it was the big Van Jones, exactly did that which America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background is always like, America is welcome every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chosen as his presidents, twice the son of a Kenianer, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas, this promise and says: to Hell with manifold, religious freedom and all the term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration by Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of a change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd breaks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could someone who isn't like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and powerful "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was like, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in Oaxaca in the province of Oaxaca in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both sites is not only changing the life of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby splendid ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, the La Banda de MÃºsica (music bandes) has been playing in the church: one of the children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments have a possibility to overcome them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the Banden's violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilots who started a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shining eyes and play in the chest you learn daily for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with redesigned instruments consist of local fixed waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio Chavez started to transform parts of the case into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violins, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trumpet and percussion that were produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chains remembers a local Ecological instructor and Musicians of the Children of Cateura, to the starting time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">The changed was shown as a Favio, which he had never seen before: a violin brought violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which is based on instruments from re-prepared material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary on "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live from him are the troubles - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra also played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">This East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted over international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices to the common use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had run illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were so upset aside and slightly tilted to welcome a law of this species on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the farmers, Mozambique and the Seychelles, mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to spend one of their harbours and refused to share him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that you simply refusing," Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship of the time and persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out from the waters of the region: it did not succeed to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillaging the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegally fishing (Illegal fishery Stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar to the six countries who had driven the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, essential for it is extremely difficult to trace. therewith, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may have a delikate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing once were hammered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snowfall, the actions nowadays occur in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries, for example, can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to characterize ships which are fishing in banned areas - such as suspects that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations may show whether the involved ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal attorney.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their harbours, which means that the ships cannot sell their load. and that they may even be forced to pay for the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>

<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beraterally supported by the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, which lose eight members of the HISH-i of each year because of the illegal fisherman that penetrate East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has produced one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">At their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licensing papers, speciality of phantasienames, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale siphole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigational ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks exposed to fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it has been persecuted and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority on the fight of crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances and received.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations carry us quite far into the networks of organizing crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is intended to help FISH-i, suspects ships precise.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be further developed, also helps to trace the illegal ships to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the Illegal Fischer are using very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "" "Duncan Copeland, Head Analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO that is also concerned with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch their automatic identification systems, wherewith they can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information related information. it should help FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Maritime Organisation Oceana platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed around the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system gives the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There is signs that FISH-i don't just feel criminal activity, but they also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships, previously confiscated without license and could hardly be reckoned with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture by MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government has rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezolans reacted in whose eyes shut the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into the void, assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the Order of Venezuela), these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area of Barinas, in the regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, centrally located in the federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezolans by an acute deficiency of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the counterpart of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the chance of a fundamental change; ultimately, however, the removal of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government's context as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, which is estimated to be the highest in the world (the inflation rate will be estimated at 500% to the annual degree) and in which a serious and far-sufficient lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered to be the only way to withdraw its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election of Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic entity), the demonstrators planned to join the National Assembly as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, should continue to continue on the 27th of October.</seg>
<seg id="165">The appeal was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is due to Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday national strike and on 3 November all after Caracas at Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">The first demonstration in the framework of the action program "The withdrawal of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, 26 October.</seg>
<seg id="171">The images of the fairy, which are published in real time, testify to a vast involvement of people in numerous territories in the country, but also disputes with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstrators who calls through the protectorrent, "Will you kill me, because I am hungry?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter suggest images that relate of disputes, as well as reports of suppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves beat the message through police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators moved back to the local Cathedral, to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advocacy of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but protests went on.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andes State TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear skirts because you could see anything else, what many national garages do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an Infographic makes the round that forms the extent of oppression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counterpart in question - this was now proven in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the road.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs are:</seg>
<seg id="186">NicolÃ¡s and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your counterpart!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Some think these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which made little against the devastating economic crisis, and rather busy preparing critical voices of critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches are increasing more in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated, during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>

<seg id="203">Starting with the office, the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operation in the La Perla prison, which he observed in the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a salinity.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, it is not noticed that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not recognize that my father was a thief, torturers and robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriegated. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father of state terrorism was his father from 1976 to 1978, Deputy Commander of the Service Department 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy, the martial arts made.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and requested me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have committed yourself with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they don't take you one day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionaries of Argentina's Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back into the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be obeyed.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university connections, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'Where are the prisoners subjected to torture '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On this day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were shut down and undertook me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he insisted on an open space, saying:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I moved in, and saw a song, tortured on the man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later, I found out that they fastened the one end of the cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They sweeten a man with handcuffs on the bed, overshot him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volt in the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The rock there was in it there was horrible... like a dirty windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same odour came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this odour.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">"I knew that these people were killed."</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me for the third time for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were chilled with handcuffs and carried out eyelids.</seg>
<seg id="250">He talked with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, an civilians who was also charged in the trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses, where naked people were lying down with the face down - all were raised in hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entranceful people quietly wait for the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners, he said, "Why do you look so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I met "Why have you brought me otherwise?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that, because my father told her home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms, which were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero killed a man and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to survivors from civilians, Jorge Romero, who was also accused of death in the La Perla Ribera trial, was also indicted by the students of RaÃºl Mateo Molina.</seg>

<seg id="262">The way, which you came in here, is also the way you came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you look at the map, see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed, and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of discovery.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of them should be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible stolen things to his home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bayonet or maybe military signs which one abuses an enemy.</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano with his son.</seg>
<seg id="272">Archive recording</seg>
<seg id="273">But when you go into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then this is no war yield but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I was asked about how my father, the director of security forces, could be involved in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">And once he called me a criminals, and I answered: and thou that steal cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded anger, stroke me, and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and embrace you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need any other!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory to him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of that, on which I bore a jacket and a wheel pullover from wool. both my father had from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me to have been a defendant with this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay me a burden on what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway, I was there to announce.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the bodies is the last seperous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I receive morse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you have children once, one can recognize the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognises that it is incorrect to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Good, you were expropriated during the dictatorship of the dictatorship, but why does the corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children do children?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with home his mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill those people. but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families, to which one could be handed over to their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the bodies is the last seperous act, which one can do a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they fetched machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and cared for somewhere - no idea where. "you will never find something," my father said.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i saw how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to put it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, my Father, was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him reproach for all of the atrocities that I had to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt inwardly, and asked myself why the whole-driven patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which they supposedly defended themselves were well.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me what to tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes, and you compelled me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He said only "Na then show me."</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I made the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I had finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can interpret me that I have voke. I finally said to my own father.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driving licence, in the last month witnesses of a very successful translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word has been replaced by the "older drivers" which means "older drivers", but maybe even with arches backups and # 8212; as a "awable driver."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Work of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was often divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was a translator Julian Holmes, a resident Kyotos. he was also attested to the local papers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun Kyoto, Kyoto, published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed. the name "Attachers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate as also grammatically not quite correct name "Elder Drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto predicts for translation errors. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from translators, and that the translation was not checked on their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are very sorry that older people felt threatened by inadequate correcting (the translation) on our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News consisted of a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers "in Japan, and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denouncing as an appropriate description of older drivers. according to the police there are older car drivers involved in accidents, but quite a occasion to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1.803 of a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen down, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period has risen.</seg>
<seg id="366">The repainless reporters published in the article published on Yahoo comments to the light that show the prejudices some Japanese are apparently opposed to older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation error was received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrible drivers ") about reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "So the translation is not at all, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that this is a true translation error."</seg>
<seg id="371">There aren't few such comments.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overcome, you need two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active mastery of the target language - something that in native language is the case. in general, the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the language language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native language should be translated from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no employees in English as a native language, which could make translations into English. this may seem to be a lack of understanding, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, have translations to produce firs internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English language is considered the best, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and enigmatic phrases that are created by machine translations, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to read or understood at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be unacceptable, or at least harmless. but of large enterprises or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serial source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is kissed, and recommended the Users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series with the title "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("fetch cows, falling schools") which will be edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from the University, she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride on her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">Who has become something of something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas denotes for more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money gives her minderous son or her underage-old daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, however, that the children need to afford countless days of household work that may never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse of abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract you can't raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">As Criadazgo, practice is widely used in Paraguay because of the involvement and acceptance through large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked with criaditas, especially young girls who are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered testimony, responded and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things on behalf, because feeling the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated the Criaditas, guarantees in general standstill.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the other hand, the family that their daughter is in faith that they will improve their education, improving their position in society and to make something out of itself, "to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that the girls takes up and whose exploitation is justifying by faith that they would have given someone a chance, otherwise no training would have been hungry, and perhaps even be hungry.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is mistreated, his family will only be experienced many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experienced it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 there was relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of severe impacts. shortly thereafter, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of former military belonging to TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as an official member of the residents.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">In late January 2016, Ferreira suggested to MarÃ­n until they suffered fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They looked at that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made deeply responsible for the death of the girl, Criadazgo's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest in protest and called that there are "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an important investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girls who had their Criadita was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before the case, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be a landmark case - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo.</seg>
<seg id="454">Everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">Criaditas are not only exploited as a labor force, they live isolated from other girls in her old age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, who worked in her father, had to register bankruptcy and lost their father to work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and started selling sweets on the street or on the market confessions to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they went all further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asuncion as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, she had to share the time that you still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">It stood every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, they purged the fridge, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and the infected floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was done with learning, the more leisure it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but got no unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the master of the house as food from the fridge," she remembered.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the master of the goodman Liberal, a Liberal military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a Liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the budgetr Alvarenga, along with him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero," or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince her to give testimony to the reports of the official media on the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He held her for intelligent, but did not undergo with her. "the master of the master had found someone who was talking about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't allow me to visit my family, because they were the opinion that I would like to learn" bad habits "in the opinion, that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would speak home to her mother tongue Guarani.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared the education that they had made, they would lose.</seg>
<seg id="474">It was completely clear, however, that she had paid for everything she had paid them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in the school, Alvarenga was discriminated. "one thing about which almost never talked about, are mobbing and the chicans to whom criaditas are exposed to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents, criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite to myself at home. I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time, where friends arise, I felt especially clear that I was one of the group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Company cheap the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share this job for cleaning staff and children's girls in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The chairman of the group is Pepa Kostianovsky, a city council in Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I'm looking for a small lawyer for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her.</seg>
<seg id="484">Learn to learning.</seg>
<seg id="485">Please call you.</seg>
<seg id="486">Starting from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad got five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the place Ãemby wrote that she had a eldest girl and gave birth to her telephone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman, which came from Ãemby, offered her 15-year-old niece. "she likes little children and is very handsome," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="490">The third comment was written by "a girl from the inland inner that wants to work."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the author divided the display again:</seg>
<seg id="492">Dear friends, I have found one. I saw if it works with her.</seg>
<seg id="493">Thank you very much, I write again if something is.</seg>
<seg id="494">The shop was completed.</seg>
<seg id="495">In prolog to the report Criaditas, Â¿hasta cuÃ¡ndo?</seg>
<seg id="496">(Criaditas, how long yet?), a collection of testimony to former Criaditas, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history, we managed to abolish systems such as slavery, CuÃ±adazgo (an economic system of the early history of the Spanish conquers), the Conquistadores who received the workers of Guarani and to their "wives" (with whom the workers had to be viewed as a half-slaves) and to provide Spanish indoctrination. therefore, it is not willing to maintain that many girls and boys become involved in a system of slavery, in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="498">Social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Criadazgo.</seg>
<seg id="499">Bill to register Egyptian users social media to register with the government</seg>
<seg id="500">Image by Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees submitted a draft bill to "the regulations concerning the usage and working social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by Parliament, users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would be set up, which is instructed to share citizens with citizens, citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register their users in the site with their correct name and personnel numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">Will it be reconciled to do this, so it could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which is running on the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video setup and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear as it is assumed if the draft does not make reference to the user, as Egyptian authorities are able to impose the user's users and users who do not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyadad Abdul Sattar, Parliament chief and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through the firewall to get the Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (based on German "senior research scientist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), talked Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I pay attention to the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they are violent, physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, then it means that they will be able to set up a powerful surveillance system to help citizens to monitor the approval or not. and that is a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed by legislative elections and the Constitutional Committees before it goes to the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his assumption and implementation will be successful or not, the design is consistent with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that there is no deviating narration on the image area, "says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the past year, the Tamer El-Shahay proposed a draft agreement against Cyber crime, which was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are guilty to threaten the "public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq, the shelter Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation of Iraq are working to protect the vaccinated Persian Leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of Leopards, who are striped through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to the loss of savourage, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of Leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the thought of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predatory is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards in fact is low and goes towards zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, breaks out Raza in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As an educated Biologin shows Raza passionate about another side of their country, which is not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies for six years in wild animals and training programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the progress made for the Northeast Japan's newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, who had been advancing in the past six years, had been affected by the "threefold catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a etely prefectures in Japan's northeast, both experienced the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to be vacated, because the tsunami had vanished the coastline of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Yet the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already alone some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made on the progress of six years after that, to rebuild the local resident resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (s.), Miyagi and Iwate were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success in the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final table with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, it was still trying to evacuate the evacuated by Behel's Countryside and evacuated in the final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-cavity catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in heating.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency sleeping, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated apartments were settled down after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate lies the number here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, have opened its doors to December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident occurred in the three prefectures of agricultural land large-scale.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear plaza."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered so far, but again Fukushima still remains disrupted.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist taxes in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima one can only offer 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine the overall image, the newspaper brought numerous surveys under the local population and evacuated among the evacuation. they inquired about the status of reconstruction and also how you meet against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the indigenous population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local resident population have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of the respondents found that still not enough for catastrophes prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who are evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention also on the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also the witness of the worst, catastrology-caused, nuclear accident, which had to be seen in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people evacuated from Fukushima were relocated in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, around 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas, most of the evacuate areas are still more than 50 years old. they have to compete in proper heating projects because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photograph.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered in the intensive care unit: last Friday it was a police officer during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia in a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against sparsely.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on Saturday and then moved to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures also shows the face of the police officer, which was identified with a buzzling strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">Following the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures depicts the police officer, as he proposes in GoiÃ¢nia and his buzzling on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officers came up by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care station, his face would be on television for six months and the whole suppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," the video channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, divided the video on the net where you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitters shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but also filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">At the bottom of the clip, one sees the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazilians (approximately 2,700 Euros) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to facilitate his family in GoiÃ¢nia while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls more violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s in memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist from his father was murdered, only to criminalise the Occupy Movement in Secondary School. and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police station, who has been attacked by a policeman, who has smitten him with a striking stock.</seg>
<seg id="614">Transfer of police</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to demonstrating brutal police officers to protesters last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were used at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, Gummigrade and TrÃ¤nengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Euro MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media protagonists have verts the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disk.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a broken glass window to illustrate with a photo their title pages illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred a title story with a blasted bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic foundation, more about a broken window, than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also recognize if one is stripped against any form of nondamage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "Vandalism" receives a absurd, consistent importance, and the typical violence of the military police are linked with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar raw factories in Cuba included the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - well known that there are no significant sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activity in the sugar tubes were layed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the earthquake, the sugar raw industry was still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute every day to the factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solder veteran that rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar raw industry do not robbed his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar raw factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar raw factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar raw materials resists the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced amount.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news should have been a motive for lack of evidence for the country for some decades, but the bad harvest is no longer any more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar raw industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar raw industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar tubes were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production targets amounted to 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar raw plantations and the sugardening on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless, the sugar price rose from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report of "Agricultural Spectrum" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Nutrition Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would achieve the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will go with security into history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructure began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the breastfeeding of 98 sugar tubes came to more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar raw factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier is known to talk about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeats the most, "betrayal."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place is preserved, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first shooting year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially distributed to documents that are only distinguished by the parts that would be removed, the address satellite and the date distinguishes.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everyone was signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister was able to approve every decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility and the letters were becoming more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the finishing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for those in operation of the sugar raw factories," he assures us.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the breastfeeding of the factory, whose construction he helped, involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located, were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut talk of October 21, 2002, the then president of the present persons present, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar refinery completed, or better said, when they began to expose it, they stopped listening to the road to asphalted, disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look up other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were given to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people also left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not used once for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016 Nene returned to factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he started working.</seg>
<seg id="682">Neunundforty Ernest bring a retirement of two thousand peso per month to spend the years retirement in MaÃ±alich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man black skin colour, small, with a few teeth and clearer voice, is not a retrageous person, yet he gives the lies that you told him not.</seg>
<seg id="684">They torment it for ten years.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do them by hip-Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshops have been offering workshops directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will ensure that the young generation of participants in our conversations such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance" or whatever you can find in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the family of Kitsumi, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Westkanada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were wasted or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video games to convey how important of receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always able to control the languages of the First Nations languages.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whaplean-stui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus was sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved young people received a little help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop group who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well as translation into English, translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody ever interested in me?</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead to our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do that, what they determined the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary piece, the reader and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a post and add the verse in silencode (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it can be seen before almost any restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, will be found close to the intervention of shokuhin sanpuru (Pig, "plastic models of dishes") of every food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that were documented by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even drive them anymore. however, a new trend is transformed today in current mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Near Naver Matoms the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic dishes, decorated cell phone bands, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitten collective objects, as in this case, refrigerated magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerated magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essences will increasingly be more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have produced this part in Tokyo at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple who's holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight-flight.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say, "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also be accepting a less appetizing form, for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting the ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), Earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other quirky plastic dishes can be seen below: itinii's Naver Matoms blog post. or follow on Twitter on the hashtag # 1 called t.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is devoted to the benefit of the restaurant industry. as for example, the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for victims of fighting against drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media over the notorious "fight against drug trade" in Mexico, the criminals and tumbling are regularly immersed in statistics. however, this mirror does not reflect the extent of human tragedy that brings together this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of the Sinaloa-Cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">A day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or to the communities that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind each suffering, behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds might never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal animal PolÃ­tico is called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trading life"), telling this victims a voice and tells stories of people who were fighting in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico is describing the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how frightened life") tells the story exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father that is seeking every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father only one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have set us, get started and to graves after the people who we loved to seek."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28, when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">He left the house on October 13.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, which is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You do not pay the insurance of my father, but it does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender's Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and the state management.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer of animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post in Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never take violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have already known illness and sensation journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day to newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be incorrect or considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes further:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it's not normal that people listen to the "helplaten" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are being exposed to statistics in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inelessness of man is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified, that they were "rising."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about that they are spared from these tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of relief in the main town district:" it describes how armed criminals took money for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will lead you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in this terrible days, if you would like to dissolve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I must learn how to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of the most distinguished generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assassinated by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a madman and he tells himself how to make a egg cooks, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence, and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody suffering of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw it:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Federal Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in view of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the Narcodata project in 2015, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trade, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in a comprehensible way.</seg>

<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" from Flickr User Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this post and the pages, to which he left, contain images that are represented on violence.</seg>
<seg id="818">The facsimile check is important in a moment in which it's about lifting a rumor or to unmask a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after being immersed for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been completely used to create tragedies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there is abundant reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, questions about our desire to look for messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a fleet of petrol cars crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, Africa's second largest country has been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region became a dangerous harness full of impact holes that were difficult to run.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the fuel tank fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Skilled representatives described a fireball who covered dozens of houses including a cinema that was full of people who were full of people watching the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses violated and scattered corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "Das is Nigeria." from the Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident make the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hidden body, which are upset on the floor, while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But the story does not find its end here.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was refreshed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but are falsely explained in the context of tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the entleaned Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Govon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Ophthalmologists reported drastically of atrocities, before which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down, and were dead in streets and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count Leichen," said a human rights to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up period could be shown on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigerias and the attempted Boko Haram trying to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image came back from the DR Congo as a proof for the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of defects; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the image was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments, such as this example, falsely explained the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also joined the fatal persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee battles, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following on, which gathered these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page, which was falsely explained by President Myanmars Than Being, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to detect this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, on the last of April 26, 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, who called AFP as their source, were also falsely explained to this statement, but had not been associated with the image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide operating range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false coupling range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how far information borders can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 pictures found, which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mask, private sites, social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages like English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have passed wrong reports, many others tried to unmask the forgeries.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who were killed by Boko Haram, published by the news page AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has explicitly explained that the picture is not written by the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar dship attack."</seg>

<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo appeared, with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram massacre and on the eve of Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>

<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as proof of the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times), but the messages that were associated with it were not accessed in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frame) that poise these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of major discussions about the silence in connection with the killing of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killing of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understanding and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer belief.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are some kind of people who are unintentionally controlled, the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this mood of the mis- and counterfeit information, that actual atrocities are untrue and decorates the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that there is a refusal to recognize pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are demanded by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that forcible pictures of readers and viewer Desensibilize and giving them the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, examining how violent media make it work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While some more regarding nonviolent representations exist in the news media, fact is fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture may be somewhat sugars, which is actually replaced by the context or completely abused manner.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. unmistakable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world to be difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: you express some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakeable words are already well known today (as the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish brake).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly in any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not sufficient, why a complete declaration and sometimes somewhat context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists include Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist by "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog we'll find words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vacaneglok" - Miramate your parents in recognition of what you have tried for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or sloth, which you feel after being heated in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog over:</seg>
<seg id="956">They grind other cultures, reveal other thoughts and wake up our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, on different kind. but somehow we will put all into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier with someone else in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the creation of stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently over a different initiative of Steven Bird, the Untranslated Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken language. it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of major cities and to appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, where TLS has been carried out in the United States since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not included in the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project,:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we assume cities, accepting densities - safe rooms, in which residents do not have to forget who they are.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listen often to understand" the listener of these events instead "to listen to feel" to feel "."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller put their history first in their own language and translate or declare it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are no professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation are that the listeners can be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughing and emotions, as the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, Rassidatou takes the opportunity to explain the history of the narrative of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the bula of the bunny and Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fist, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grinsen he shares his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. everyone who are inspired by the project can organize with TLS in contact to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the U.S. reconstruction of the sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico, several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the purelocation Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went down to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination of the debts) and the Ãkomenian church assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessation of the debt relief of debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos calls for the politicians, banks and government agencies, who are responsible for the debt, for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for financial testing and a cable committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions, remuneration, which must benefit in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not their own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sinking profitability.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the country's bundled territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence, the so-called "center for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organisation with focus on socio-economic development, a law to state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the government infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures are imposed from the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration took the name "Nightwatch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that will be aligned in Berlin, dedicated an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist born in France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Ruhling, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom series, produced by so-called 'book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, lasen extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inca (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was released last year and is licensed here, contains a series of paragraphs that deal with free culture in face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what the real cost is associated with which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who have been involved in the movements of free knowledge have been working on site to view over the fog, which converts our newsfeeds and to create a little sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prisons in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us will begin to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of timely extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel based on the basis of a" strictly secret "given command of the Military Court in Adra was taken."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and the knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and presently persuaded the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of Bassels cultural prototypes anticipating the work that he started working with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstructing the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosswise of numerous civilization and melting the Greek-Roman architecture types with hideed traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything to this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stunt to digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsulsel which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life, of freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even as he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned English to read and talk English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge to be asked with everyone who asked. he has taught other inmates to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other inmates, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually stopped one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a provocation that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed freely.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book covers from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens."</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I am in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the senses in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of fences, armchairs and guard</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the indoors of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I was in every detail of your voice and words,</seg>
<seg id="1235">I bear with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes may say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And over your absence to weep and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you're still in the cage of the Monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) since the start of protests in 2011, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime, were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many further people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community announces the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: resurrected by corruption, director for release again</seg>
<seg id="1255">MosMozambique reacted with anger on a corrupt incident, where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This was found by Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose advice Cambaza was CFO between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good leadership and immediately requested his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Prosecutor of the Republic, who had requested the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, back to his old post, since the company was not doing disciplines of disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not have the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrated ridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to relocate the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clearly illustrates the absence of transparency and is even a return step with regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we do to know is that the company also should have a disciplines of disciplines against the rebarians.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently said and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambiance social media, refuses this behaviour as well as "rebellious":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, it would be advisors after he was sentenced to prison and had half of them to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has infiltrated to become reintegrated into the company that he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resisted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director had no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he promised him, I cannot believe that someone has been rewarded with such a way that the state has already been insulted so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza missing the morality to serve and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead, instead, serves himself only on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handwritten money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte faves it to remind the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belongs to the prison of Samora Machel the Mozambique is not only staying for ever as the first independent president of the Mozambique, but also as a sharp, concision and - by next door - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he confirmed that "an ambitious man should be able to be able to sell his own ambition to his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn off his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions were also opposed to:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat for 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today, the company, with which he disagrees, is again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - On Î±dir (@ azmal _ Rafik), May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emitdo Sambo by the magazine @ Verdade (dt.: @ truth) states that crime is paid in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or coherage.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network received their posts from the net because they played the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people Eastern Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is licensed by the word "Kalar" or of course. (in Burmese Scriptures) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radically nationalist movements has given an extremely temporal connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speaking against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight anti-hate language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not invoke hate language.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmeric words with basic meanings which have the same bookcases like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair at Burmese also wrote 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(spage),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookusers Aung Kaat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was extinguished today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, if she knew how he could relieve his back pain, as he made a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hurt is the opinion that they should be a radical nationalists, however, also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analyzing all of the posts, which is suspected of spreading racism in the suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write to Facguard.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead, the post is carefully analysed and control it by checking the remaining words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spheres).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three nationalists who disseminate hate language, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion may send a strong signal to all that hate hate language, the efficiency of this strategy is not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and Wechat proved that the censorship of impact often will start a cat and mouse game, whereby the user's social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaat's Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts, when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attention to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and me the liken, post and sharing content is prohibited for 24 hours, because the mail "Facebook community has not answered."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a multitude of posts from people that have no negative intentions, or simply try to show their opinions against them to speak radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasstions of Facebook is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided its opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook is supposed to have done more than the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmical Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To demonstrate such words, only even more hatred will bring within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support, such as "chair" or "inheritance curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they were not attempted to report the falsely dissolved Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship is fed by users for a lot of donors.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now rely on Facebook funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that have no hate language but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Permission used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmeric text is "I want to sit on a chair and a pea curry and a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists who used social networks have increased to extend their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassal is alleged to increase violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the territory of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been responsible for his failure to talk to his burial sites under control, criticised.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of getting the word 'Kalar', it would have better running, rather focused on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country unanimously decided to agree to the law that this practice is to offer, so that the married age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change in marriage, there were several members of dualistic and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the religious groups (IRO), a group that representatives of the various religious groups of the country was gathered that the state should not interfere with the state that, age, not the maturity of maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN child's legal prevention, the minors as, every man under 18 years "defined.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 had already been married to Trinidad and Tobago, and 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that by 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were striving to abolish laws on the children's before, followed at the foot and rejoiced great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the child before, they should not worry about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition looked uncomplicated for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and some doubts came to whether the opposition would agree to the draft of the law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill of the bill was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the Opposition and an independent which he contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree, and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country issued a status update on Facebook which has once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's before was in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for that and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he had previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media user was thrilled, because the laws have been changed for children before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who was a prime minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It doesn't need much time and unnecessary gossip that has sworn the core of the matter, but you know what? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that's almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, there was definitely enough time to create the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, herrading news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who listens to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil social group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the change of marriage was today, on 9 June 2017, decided.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members, and 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the MPs, who were against the law, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's before is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childmarriageisky.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have foaled him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations. congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months Maharaj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney Paris Al rawi, a discoloration of the law, said it was absolutely correct when Maharaj was going to act against the law, the majority of social media users would need to change the debate on the subject matter.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we say, instead of making the discussion as general, in a way that we invite you to speak to our bedroom, that the state that our daughters may protect against them, that they may possibly be abused by large, persistent men, would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legally legal or still the norm, although there are laws which they are subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers trouges the Office of the Prosecutor's Office in front of the Russian National Day</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen print of the message that was posted on Sunday early on the website of the district Yaroslavl.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of national demonstrations against corruption, which coincide with the day of Russia - the Russian national day - the website of the district of Yaroslavl was hacked. the hackers have left a funny message "stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Or we bring you into the creast instead of Dimon. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">The hacker postponed the YouTube video "He is not a Dimon for you" on the website of the Prosecutor's website: "the Office of the State Court invites citizens to follow provocations and keep away from all non-sanction events!"</seg>
<seg id="1387">At 11.15 the message was removed from the side - but in the cache they remained.</seg>
<seg id="1388">It is # gently disappeared</seg>
<seg id="1389">On Sunday, the office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service YarNews that they were hacked.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Through the skewer of websites, Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012 to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally evaporated internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over one month, Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle of the encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day, more significant, how important is the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV-series are fighting against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many studied Internet users are used to use addressing websites (a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users don't fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey closed the article by Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University finds out regular blockades of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world, when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator calculator), which is not making a complete set of censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is also available despite the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS tells about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the messages (via the blocking of Wikipedia) we set everything to put snapshots of Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to look at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they can't reach the www.wikipedo org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step has been carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely a screenshots and any live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiknock pe.org, an open source project that everyone can use to hosten similar Mirror pages when in particular country Wikipedia is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices, as well as employees at Mozilla Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It's not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You get to another URL, which is not the original. that what you see then is of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Permission used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with bad-positioned motives and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him a camera to wear and try to oppose the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepal is trying to bring the international stage to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home location right next to Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook as this first-class situation in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when Navaraj was suddenly called in Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">I ran immediately with my camera and was in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the Leopard was found and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nepals Nature and want to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so furious as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was able to face Tigers from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot interfere with the opinion of the sheep in sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also, because of darkness was on the way home, when suddenly the King of the Buhek appeared. he immediately turns away, we look forward to and he starred me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to make in the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1465">Years after the wedding car, Indian women for the first time to address the name of their husbands</seg>
<seg id="1466">Women in the small Indian village of Gumla Jam Gayi in Jharknight.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was released here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid women with greatest care, name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband due to the social pressure to respect the husband, and fear of the consequences they should have respect the norm in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Oha, a pseudostem and the family community, after having addressed a married relatives with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not name in the name is also common in men. however, they have much less assignments to fear if at all that, they shouldn't follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals and housewives, represented a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss the habits of the Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and set up for the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of their videocamera at the discovery of practices, such as children's heating up to the network of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and runs this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them to the ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that showed Rohini in their discussion, was of women who did not call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided for this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">According to the name of their husbands, it is a spectacle that they pleaded not guilty to all obligations and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes for a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this will be regarded as a sudden, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never had thought of this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini wanted to have never had her husband, so far, had never been called, at home, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should call him by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion skies.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to take discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us, means that they will not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that in the whole exercise only hurried out, and another decided to release all the frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In the Adrenalinexchange on this, with an ancient spectacle, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas she sat in the head: his wife could not cease to tell his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another dent member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law urged her, she got afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participants in violence was less understandable and the situation in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as the carrying case of the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he also tattoo.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I stopped to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but mean, they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, discussion sklub is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with each discussion sklub.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to take care of women who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the past few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes, they danced and sang about things which they had never made thoughts before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have some things, for example, like our identities on our husbands, never said so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried sworn only by Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted to wear a salta-cta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they have not been comforted.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion on the advantages of their own dress code, the morality linked to Saris and much more, decorate Rohini their own couple Curtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan an excursion to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the question, whether in the five months after their first discussion skies, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then again they stopped to tell the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, included me, do not make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two shall continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear Zinnoberred at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion-lub know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the Feiling around more freedom of movement or the own hand-election - at the end of a difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if any woman enters the club home and other people of it, what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the incarcerated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo received attention in international community attention after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for cancer of cancer in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangering), following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Lius Case as "an internal affair" and a speaker tells, he considered "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China is still receiving calls from international community, Nobel prize laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, release or permit a treat abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely exposed to the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A speaker, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should practice pressure to enable Liu in foreign countries abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">The Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brend have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway got into the Stocks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2010, although the Norwegian government had announced that this ultimately had nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December of last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement in order to resume the salmon trip to China, as the exports were mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After receiving the message that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought up his hope to an unconditional release, and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention, he was unable to oppose his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to help him to seek medical assistance where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called on China for the release of Lius, as she hasted in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr Lius wife, as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet all visits and receive, they desire, and be able to communicate free with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">Speaking in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, the news agency was announced on 27 June that the embassy was released by the Chinese authorities, not just Liu, but also to free his wife Ms. Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The response to the US embassy was a liking response from China to itself, with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country have the right to join in and unanswered questions about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple that China should offer:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel integrity and access to medical care of his choice, which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push and release Liu and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I challenge China to release the Nobel prize laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, in order to provide a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">The German government speaker Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3rd, Berlin that Liu explains all the medical support he needed "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Peking, the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns, whether the host of Liu could cause a visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called for China to provide an adequate medical care to provide providing an appropriate medical care and giving him the opportunity to make himself away from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP earlier that Lius wife, Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police will always visit the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact us.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to compulsory international human rights violations, including freedom of expression, to uphold the rights of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments that he, independent where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family may have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news conference France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out if France should end up.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the Festival in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Liu and a major tolerance to those who require peaceful funds to challenge political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator of the ruling party Yu Mei-nu also called for China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed up in an explanation on June 28 around Liu very worried and gave him that many asked him to pray for Lius Wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives that he took, and for which he had been punished, would have led to a harmonious, stable and wealthy of their China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who inspired Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore was considered to be a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This note has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of a meeting at the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifice, this valuable country to create, you can say that we finally have no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had an escape in front of the responsibilities, a must violate.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons presented by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in view of which he appeared insolically undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities that are lead to a party permanently.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old corer from the authorized machinations that indicate the Democrats, leave the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of last week Shanmugam given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our itdiative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He warned them with non-Answer-rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion because they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our advertised K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if it was highly paid to be part of the town of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By releasing his comment on the blog, he shows concerning the critics that you should start to read the entire co-address of the conference, in order to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a town, and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said that Singapore is rather a "city" as a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so uneasier, even if we are looking forward to free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He delighted Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said, Singapore is not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan reveals his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is a leader of a growing generation, such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice spoke in Singapore very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde what I expected - should I agree with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, right and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review sets the vulnerability of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "have committed a mistake, or was it a Freudscher speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country go to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabin, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do not defend their military service, but do not defend their own country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay tax invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country, or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In fact, the Journey of a Decade concerning the year of birth, Singapore is and always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have injured many of the people...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country especially" etc, "but that's not quite right.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked for short his editors: what is the most abused aspect at your home location or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world and a different Facets should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," and I will answer. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation is taking place, it is regarded as polite, interest in his conversation partner by taking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clarification usually follows the standard response: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook even innurous of anger, if they are kept for Americans, but not bothered me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadian player from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian banner well visible on their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started traveling through the world - before Donald Trump, before the march of Iraq and September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always borne small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposed to be regarded as the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as such types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would make me nothing, if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly: as "nice" signifies, is basically to be scourier - as the benevolent, soft, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has a very own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, is inconspicuous and uninteresting to make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good when you want to stay unnoticed in the background, ferrite of things that pass around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a prime minister of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsias listed as "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lacks warm hearted, open kindness, whom I connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau then entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada just a sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A music video published in Thailand, which led the Junta parodiert who took power in 2014 and restore the civil government in spite of their promises to recover the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, this was shared on Facebook highly charged video 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists opened the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular it is concerned with the situation of the country under the Junta regime.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at the videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand have been prosecuted for the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may refer to the drakonic section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which was given the commander-in-chief of the host absolute decision on important national themes.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the "integration process" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are viewed from the Junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal ality, whose vague and unclear regulations often used by the authorities to unite activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, supervised by the online content and individuals who accused of having slandered the monarchy and prosecutes the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict view against "Lese Majeste" (MajestÃ¤ttis).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the law was declared war in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup of the Army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems continuing the Junta continues to buy their decision to buy expensive underground boats, although security experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax rights.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, even as people will be thrown into a black supplier, before you put them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison, because they allegedly have caused "confusion" in society and ususmen usury, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the team members of the band members who used the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by Putin's opponents during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asia-Asia, Georgier and Armenians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, Russians and abortions live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">These settlements are also called Geistercities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these vulcanals.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased after a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1829">There were municipal centres, schools and kindergartens, who served all the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with inflatable splendour buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">People who once lived on this site and made their contribution to the central planning management of the Soviet Union, have left the district meanwhile.</seg>

<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the subsistence economy (cultivation of agricultural products) such as cattle breeding, beekeeping and vegetable cultivation.</seg>

<seg id="1895">ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article from Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">In the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located at the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a coral pink spectacle frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy shape form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, removable walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haired migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, tells the people in full small busses and from the top part of the coast to call her: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time, it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would not like to reject.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, massage them with a balm that are exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was a reasonable nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a jogging moustache) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracks.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes," "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to relocate her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other guides of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the circuit," Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the way together and that Afrikaner already speak on WhatsApp by Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his leading companion, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez contact.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother, and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always remain in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells us that their guests are often sending text messages when they have continued to post her, or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought their hands to prepare chickens as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only sparking hope to travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, Sackgasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family stayed in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Bustickets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking facility outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencia explains that he knows what the guests make.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the wilderness and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his working site from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula is coming from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted money to make money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a all-one, has offered him the roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still, and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears consult the travelers quietly their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud Grandmother, she utters her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair stains who made their clientele, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers know more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she asks her for a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fusions" repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-out Point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang by Twitter users</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in Western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the City Urumqi a mobile phone message in which it shows the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the notification, the app will be said to "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities were able to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had shortly after having installed the App, messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification made by the police that the app determine the sources and the distribution ways of the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs Website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojan and Phishing pages to make users attentively, how much time they spend online, and to remotely control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors are to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these functions can naturally be used in diverse ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" remote players or even hacker may be manipulating the home network of a person or steal out of it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China most often focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit the unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme interest and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet connections.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media outlet "Images from Mainland China" (production, production news in China) showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen were then overchecked if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have discovered an checkpoint with one device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (derived from the number of course), the software published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can raise the identification requirements of a Windows operating system, and thus avoiding unrestricted access to the computer's hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingvang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities, and the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computer and communications equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report by Freedom House, an American Human Rights Organisation, mentioned this new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs who register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks, and media cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and annihilate any "terrorist videos." this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible action, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in the series "sleep or death" in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in an Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Far away from our blue, virtual world you look at and make sure you're very alone in one place where all the important is disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has been revealed and dissolves and a truth reveals that it is clearly recognisable, both inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all honor their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions, which allow no metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But if you climb the reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the actor, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubt, in smoke, and you will be aware of your existence, even if the earth is on the axis of the storm. you will clear that you are here between the walls, your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They arrested me and my father three times, but this was not enough so that I did not formulate "my lesson," as the boss of the Security Council formed it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He introduced his power to us by giving even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were carried out during a peaceful protests like the weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to carry out the city the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" scream.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the town was coveted, not my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a town, which up to the arteries with state security organisms and their complices.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had a little soothes after the power supply had to work in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by crying several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice through the stillness.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I wasn't alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends joined me; we allied us to a splendid picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled all.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment, you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp, but it just doesn't look at anything.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "make you ready, we meet us at the military safety building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey can you swallow - nothing can return to you, after you gave them all the way to the office of security services from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men. my father was already there, as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan starts to say: "let me hear how you cry" Allahu Akbar "or you're only brave enough to shout if we are not in the vicinity."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hassfilled eyes looked upon me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you dream of what to look to me in the eyes and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did, has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Maybe it was in my foolishness, vanity; maybe in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure when I answered, "I didn't think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I never stopped to look forward to your eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I regret not a word from what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"he is in solitary and his father equal with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father is equal with it."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The tank of this fluffy is mine, until today, in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became a "syndrome," a seatic torture that I was exposed to months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I outward the farm.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office, I leave everything I bear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Afterwards again through the yard and the second office, which leads through a walk to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I have all the details exactly before I'm interested in the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise, they have assigned a larger cell for me this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one another prisoner, and may sit down immediately without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the officials left the cell, and I grabbed a well-proven communication method: to strike with the fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell phone was a "Erstheses" was.</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation, he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prestigious man middle age, which is similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness you don't know any distinctive factions, and doctors do not exist here; we are all numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice is similar to my sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers verns its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was relocated in one of the major cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me, they would cheer him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liar.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would like to have had a scarecrow to distribute all these crows, which lutes the fruits in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From the distance I hear it still "Allahu Akbar" screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always around this time the screams, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black is the color of the perdition, until I saw the yellow light that gave us the chewing in person: the Raad (about: "thunder", play on the 13th Sure of Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"they are here to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="2055">That was the secret to protect and prevent the state security against us and to prevent the terrorist situation in us, they speak in alawegian dialect - so they played their confessional replacement card and riverted the strict view of the world's view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, here is no country; it is a curse that they call Koexistenz to transform the criminals of their clans into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I am interested in the hearing and meet at Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he comes before me.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that were astonished at him: "my boy, you are still young, you can begin with your life, as you can join this day and to protest at the end that soon will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I do not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I used it to me, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really not say exactly what insults and strokes after a friendly conversation for me to be a good communication agent.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told me to be punished or bad, even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">An sentence in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">Its command is to pluck me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly confession of confession. "</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe, which probably dates from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henryman killeth on your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him and you can't keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams are not yet enough, why they cast the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked whether the investigators had worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other, to present us, from their sight, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour, three of them changed, whereas I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all my body in my body - and also my voice, which I heard cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noticed the cooling down, and found no pleasure in it, why he grabbed the next to a electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flows my whole body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect electricity manager.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to put my sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, that came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light fulfils the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallat Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallat Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallat Hdaib spends the most of his time; sometimes he fell on his screen, to his computer, and again at his couch again.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But to what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers, or his with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house that belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who was transferred to the conservative majority and their altproven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian conflict. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in towns, which from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not fully restricted in his mind by limits to people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not profit it openly, he hitting a special inclination against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas, anything with his identity as "Palestinian conflict of the second generation" - so he himself describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and never before Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own life circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while in water soldered nest cafe in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, to fasten sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sening hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the casein of the Kent cigarette in the nose are primarily associated with freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under free skies, especially when you throw a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it simply avoids to do basic things - as in public during the Ramadan water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the country is contradicted, cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table be.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press leaders in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub spoke in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled "because of sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which represent the approved legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila considers the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to stand out "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply a silky rhetoric, but actually a clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in the Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib resisted traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have voihelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an evidently ill-unknown woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of "Ehrenmorde" has increased - the unofficial outside is left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of Honor in 2016 reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is missing, for women who have become victims of violence or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for fragile control from 1954, women who are subject to the risk of incorporate violence, "and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known to dismiss topics that are in the country long as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, is that he could separate his music, which is full of explicit announcements on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was intimidated in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib occupies the question after Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically active in the core, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want, "whether it is faith or nonbelief, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still being censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian OnlineProgram Roya, to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">On Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a processed version, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals is not speaking to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudas, who was later to work on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century openly could write about homosexuality, why can Jordan be that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, as Hdaib, did nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom it is nothing new, that government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the justification that they would have expressed serious problems with the problems associated with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the Hdaibs Opinion, only the top of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is an independent gutter and take a show for him. Jordan has stopped for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it sees hdaib - consists of slow, reasoned and inner changes. it is safe to take these changes from day to day at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, of a Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not just dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, scattered unitions and artificial type of democracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time is done, Hdaib is raging and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually over in August in many regions of Tohocus, and from a period come, in the armies of Japan invaded the northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi in force.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nonetheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only True - and a stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearance and body care were so important as in this story, because they are helping to keep the Peruvian youth from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic centre of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate where roadside and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017, that 51.5 percent of the population of this region does not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and thus also the sophisticated hairstyles of famous sportsers such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Brazil), Arturo Vidal (Brazil), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), has led to that there will always be more normal citizen into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can make this elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts at each other in order to show who can create the eccentric Looks like you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitors can be found on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people to convince her weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice a training in hairdresser, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the potential opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession currently being in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year in March, and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud, because of love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: Liebesletters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the article "love messenger of guerrilla fighters," which has published international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more importantly, people who have fallen out to oppose affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">The two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation was not inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write to the campaign Carta por la Reconstructive aciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people encourages letters to write guerrilla fighters letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The subordination of the Peace Treaty was considered to be so important that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the column there is still a long way, until you can talk about an acting reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, had been exposed to a war rhetoric and around the clock in the clock, they have to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian Society in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant oppression, and in some cases of deep hatred for guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young columbians had to join together and had to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla fighters - that will then be transmitted personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Laureates who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people we love to write on the Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those forgot who need much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told us further, in this year his love with people sharing the most urgent additives.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC which now have to build their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters are prepared to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all bigger cities, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN warehouse in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation of Bogotkind traveled to the camp to take the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC emerged as they had done before, to oppose the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of subsistence of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between", told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Board of Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed over the letters, a former fighters led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of tent where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighters that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him there was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the village.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I asked him, "Hello, what are they doing?" he answered, "I reply to a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something like a nice, therefore I answer it. "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something different from life as war. the FARC was never expected to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation. "I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I've only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion lap.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as already war and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced, how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country just fair.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people, who had never found hearing, had no electoral law, and to recognize that the people who I often had seen as a monster, and even hate people who were turned around through their lives and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men, even those who have killed, have done so much harm to give us something, and give a smile and embrace.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monanove, Archbishop of the city Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Column has been made, that after deforestation would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to raise the weapons and to protest against their rights, and that is totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That's why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they listen - all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution, and bring victims, because we know from their own experience that nothing is easy. in those of us who defend life as foundation of existence, many difficulties are imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2242">It follows the translation of an article published by our partner Aida Mirmaksumowa and the first publication on the OC Media website.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in Caucasian region are subject to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and compressors.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terrors, activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about persecution gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which is like a Damoklash value over the LGBTQ community, is not only developed over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared with us some of their experiences and talked about what is happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines after several months, after reports published, which were issued against the towing, torture and killing of queens in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gaseta, she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, suspects the suspicious men and found them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was grown up, her consciously became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, so they moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned from the gender equality of their land woman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Fear for her life, she moved the final end of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that somebody needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who was stuck in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought, he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. "then there is no men more in Chechnya that can remove these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos taken from my documents through the whole of WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was in doing just a few days from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you honour the family, you scandfleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last final in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had taken everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">At the hospital, I learned that I had two nostrils in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulances have you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor stood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office door, I got it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, foreigners, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to return to Chechnya to prove that this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They ordered the absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it up without through the roads; others wanted me to go up in the official television in Grozny and I say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tries to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much, and she placed a strock around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a apartment and already a few hours later under the window, a car with dark windows and a license plate with 95 points.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time, it was clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends were checked by the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give her name, but I will say that I remember all of them, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelief happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without a sign without a reference, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you were in safety, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">You know, in which hotel you see. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove you, it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the gender equality, but this is a tabular theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I wish it, this seatic barrier can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I don't give myself effort to look like the person from their past - so my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What to do your friends, those who have stayed in?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I had updated information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who gave the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told, that during the Ramadan was not arrested and tortured and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he completed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they become concentrating on family and family now.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Thus, my I, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by the blood of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says that there were just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have not enough relatives, or those of their relatives have been left to set Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there so they can later present themselves as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they were attacked in any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only one assumption or have you a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm just getting someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there was nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And so called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">But until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who have heard a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, had already been held in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Grosny when I was living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally intended to lead us to the "Civilization," but ultimately led us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had coloured eyelash, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security Ministry of the Scharia has never been curved to me only.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and all the city knew of it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrasing: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotto is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children, when they are funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut her eyes before you, because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chasing and never been beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts lead?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us, but priority over women's behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic fell steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still works as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I comment with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teetreffs, collars, I gifted them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not reach a penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I apperate listeners.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a bite?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has pure nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechens who want to do with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no vibrations in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have Kabardiner, who also have Russians; on all the planet it gives them - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, therefore it is unpleasant to hear, so what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fasten during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know many thinking about Transidental men to men who love men, and they believe that you have changed his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a Trugation.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not feel ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I become so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not at all at all - I know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn prior to an increase of self mornings within the impoverished Arabian Ahwazi-Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there is a strong increase in self-morality.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on 27 August the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi-Community in Iran that is characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra, in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and ashamed for his own helplessness that can rise to inability to his family, such as Ahwazi-human rights groups who want to remain in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube, held the moments after he had lit himself, firmly.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Talegra hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burning were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Jamawazi minority, and activists warned against the place that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Moussawi and ShahaBani Tamim - have hanged himself.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing common: there were all the family fathers, who, due to the persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue their safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi-community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to dispute its habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Jamawaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and undertook major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most sustainable and most precious areas of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy also develops slowly, and the indigenous population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deflection.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to pursue jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dames, the waters of the Arab lands in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demme have only led to destroy devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian director of cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are searching for a school, completed a secondary school and completed 45% of a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy..." to destroy the spirit of national resistance "</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of self morality among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly unemployment has become worse compared to unemployment. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz newly-coming ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arabian Ahwazi is deducted access to working opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their life beyond their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their advantages and surnames to hide their belonging to Ahwazi, as even Arab names will not be tolerated at work, because the speaking of Arabic language or the carrying of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances given that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, strike human rights activists, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world is waking up and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why don't I identify with feminism, even with the intersectional not"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was an object of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women react, especially white women who call themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">She wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even imagined scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money despite the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under stringent observation, if it is about what they may do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women are sooner or later in various areas of life to a glacidic blanket, and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is conscious of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I speak on skin color, on racism, on black females in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I speak, on which kind of feminist and verbal abused, many white feminists left and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women should come together to meet their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing, to achieve the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualized violence, there is an inter-nationalized violence, that we have black women to be exposed to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that, black women and women of other ethnicities and hospitals are less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black Spare and women with a migration background exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership, than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all men, all men, and all men, nor skin colour the same rights; on the other hand, I can't use the white woman who refuses to consider unjustices in their thinking, which relate to gender than even on the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spelling that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs to advance their egoeccentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to get white women the importance of overcoming skin color and gender. because some of them continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women a home and renounce themselves from the white feminism, still the word "Feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer it to get me completely and get rid of feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and we will be able to provide us in the gap we will be created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana'anism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after having read these lines, please inform themselves about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I still exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither overthrown, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I definitely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost as I was a child," Musa tells Musa.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by turf. the article belongs to the number # PorserMujer (# weilicheneWomen) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer told Ada BÃ¡ez that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent as violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship, some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed because of mistreatment, the complete display of Ada BÃ¡ez did not benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women, it is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have given an ad at all, they generally have no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse it. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit victims of violence to be victims of law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Maintenance 2 Invisible Missions and Statistic 2 Invisible Missions and a Legal System, which Nothing Unnimmt3 of the laws: good approach, lack of implementations and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a research scientist at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Egyms, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that are not even ansatin to show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Office of the Prosecutor dropped 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence at the peacekeeping. 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the readings, 40% of women said they were physically abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women minister, Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these criminal offences. "for any woman who imbursed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On every woman who imbursed for physical abuse, two women come to do this, "she declared at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, the prosecution authorities can not adequately documented how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, a woman died because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible Missions and a legal system, which does not undertake nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but afterwards, however, this should always regret it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but two years she carried the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier this, I thought that only women come to subjection, because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions to Facebook, in which they described its insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to see that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users surveyed Mariana, why they had dropped from Carlos for so long, and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had mailed her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partner who developed into an unmistakable jurist struggle between Paraguay and her homeland, where it was mainly around money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach, lacking conversion</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not being applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The admissions of mistreatment is a path of resistors and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, looks great problems with the use of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed under the hashtag # Porellas (# Fear).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-eager) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the bill is to explain the Female d to a strange crime-continuance and tougher as it is the case in neighbouring countries, Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature has changed in some points to also win the MPs to the law that, in order that the way for decriminalization of abortions, which are currently being prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The bill has provided, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) travel costs that have to carry out the victims of violence even if they just want to refund and secure a safe accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial funds for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay is seen mistreatment as a part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, an outline will take place, so violence is no longer considered a slightly different.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in view of these facts, making him guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must restore that long way, until mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had changed. in fact, parts of the law had been canceled. among other things, a passage that the partners began to reconcile the partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggressor, to attack its victims again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence," and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law does not apply as a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2545">An independent media in Oman one year after prohibition of a newspaper continues to ban attacks</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website was locked due to a decision of the information minister," is on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago the omanic authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn for its reporting on corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before court, but later they returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn 'in Oman, who came to power after he had lost his father, Said ibn Taimur by a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to its role as the only Sultan, the principal ethites in the country: Prime Minister, Defense Minister, chief commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme National Bank for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultans of the sultans is characterized by the asshardy efforts of security forces, in particular the public liberties, including freedom of freedom, violets and human rights defence, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidate and incarnation.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities have systematically mischief and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, including activists in mind, their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, their closure, and the recruitment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which since its creation in 2007 was reported over corruption in Oman (a absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, Security Council Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Security, arrested by Azamn, who had appeared in the newspaper on July 26, 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties to tie hands on judiciary." in this, there was corruption in the Judiciary and the mixture of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the editorial committee, was invited to the Special Department, and was arrested on his arrival of security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS received the Deputy Chief Editor, Yousef Al-Haj, who worked as Chief Editor for Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed on indefinite period after the information ministers had given the statement that "the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way, including online, banned from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016 the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place on 26 September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj both were convicted of disruption of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "Underexcavation of the State of State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of infringement of an audience and slander guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines at a height of 3000 omani Rial (7800 US dollars), and a yearling professional ban against the two journalists were hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars), after using the use of an information grid for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">At Al Abri, a deposit of 5000 omani Rial (13 000 US dollars) was set on 22 August 2016, and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri at a hearing on 26 December 2016, and sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after closing his six month prison sentence from the central prison in Mascat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served his sentence in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also emphasised the decision of the Ministry of Education, to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the court, Azamn again, the newspaper looks after the attacks were subjected to attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information received an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister introduced a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court, the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where it was hurt in Oman at the recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuous closure of Azamn and the detention of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the oman authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive injury of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the oman authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately release and unconditionally release;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. a safe environment for the Azamn newspaper to create, so that their journalists can work on their work;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the demand on site-run medical research there are two reasons: for a lack in the offer of global health services, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious effects as elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists itself, will only be able to develop its own research capacity in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Exploration of Infection in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, he explored himself on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of media on these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private owner).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is based on research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion of the important current knowledge issues in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we just put solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being mover.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's difficult to find people who come back or come here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need to special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of the world, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the values of access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system shows that magazines are only accessible to payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: as "open source" seed producers to change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports on solution for environmental issues worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breed already in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as the reddish, the first plant, cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was made only by his own intolerance and the question of how many salads he can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented, and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or laminated leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been signed on more plants such as cereal or cartoning, because of this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and atomic facts provide food security to the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton still picks a salad, but he now needs longer, since its work is always worth more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like the rock I'd like to lie in a river in order to pull out.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it's a rupture with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think this patents go too far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salad, because all characteristics are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">In doing so, however, it is very careful and strives to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement connected to the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red RÃ¶mersal at the variety Outreddish in "Greenhouse House" from the station and eaten. there will be tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are permanently usable.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, in short Ossi, U.S. breeders may undertake that others can be used seeds free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to sell shops and sell it. "open source" breeders allow others to cross their seed, to avoid such own varieties, and not immediately contaminate - two aspects that are banned by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi executive board Jack Kloppenburg are control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger associations such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by using seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably productive vegetables, should also know that the species is bred on farms, such as this vegetable is bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereign without seed-sovereign people is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to provide other seeds free to provide them free. thus, its approach is opposed to patented seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is at risk because the available Genpool due to the ever more abundant intellectual property rights on plant material, which therefore always be restricted, unpaved.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the Director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all cartottenants are protected as intellectual property, thereby it is not even difficult for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massless congenital plants are patented as wheat in even greater style, as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such that their taste or color improves up to such as they thrive in particular environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents based on plant properties prove that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more patents. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever since the changing conditions are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-speaking in Carly Scaduto proves that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States, the company has set up the company for maintaining the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts that intellectual property may include other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant varieties of innovations." "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions are often help to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is not inhibited to innovation, but helps it to be provided by public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks like this: 20 years to wait until a patent strap, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed in plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general good condition and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to simplify farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we don't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton does not interfere with the concept to patented other plant characteristics: "we are not creating the characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them, and as a breeder, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever seeks a variety, will chastise his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes on the industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, who are required to grow massaging of herbicides, are breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very genetically. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents are creating the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either do they reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by avoidance of plant patents: "it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to be constantly new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years of age, "he says." with a patent it is 20 years long before competition, with what you feel very nice. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US appears to be a leader in the "open source," the concept has meanwhile spread rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes themselves as professional organisation in the field of resources, an "open-source" seed programme. for the preservation of traditional crops, the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties which meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell its own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol has been working on a "Open-Source" License, which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from land to land, which is not easy to use one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. this makes it possible against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents to be admitted to the conventional farmed plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, there is no law yet; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards the sponsoring of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos "Program for" Open Source, "seed-based systems currently declares that the organisation should be a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems for scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit organisation organisation USC Canada and Concentration Group) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, which publishes a global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid organisations like the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to contribute to seed and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection between the Luby from Ossi hopes it will soon be able to know more people soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has thought out, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now attempting to make people clear that there is still more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time, it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the National Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, where it was criticised by the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The WNetwork for Human Rights Information Required - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution to defend their goal, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI, it was never so important as now. ANHRI was not so important as now. ANHRI was that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the blocking, and not give up. we hope to continue our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the shaft of the wave trap for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to Egypt's blog and Human Rights Research Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the dissemination of columnists and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established to circumvent the Egyptian government of the Egyptian government, even goal of aggression.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which is also home to Ziadas, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 and recorded a video as the police had exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly turning around politics and human rights issues in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada uttered at the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock the blogs, however, is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the barge of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for me for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey the feeling of a siege to me; a arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I took it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud are going to end up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities blocked technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by converting to internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filtering contents, which might have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will also be diminished, that the decision-decisions are made behind closed doors, thereby reducing the Egyptian population no legal basis with which it can proceed in front of judgment against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day reports newspapers with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of the country and home of numerous Postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Each second day is a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "Diebe robbery pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in an angulated financial situation, the power of violence in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting on violence in Rio-known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the Editorial "This is not normal," in which it announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision said the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world such as murder, robbery, sexualverbreaking, etc. everything that happened from the civilized standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the "War" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we do not close our eyes from the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, Chief Editor's Editor, stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that did not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, journalist of the newspaper, that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 areas will be controlled by criminals.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when he is distorted, it can also be used, atrocities of the police, who shoots, and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and struggle against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "War" benefit from it more than them?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues against violence as a "war." this is, according to a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to draw responsibilities regarding the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - how to be shown at the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investment in personnel, education and historical and self-counterfeit failure of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than only its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is false according to CecÃ­lia: "22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil, according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio is on rank 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the Globo company, the largest media company South America, which is emphasized as CecÃ­lia, repeats the state policy of the state policy since years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these security policy measures also belonged to UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to conquer a Favela police force and stationed a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. since a few years, the UPP took control over the poor communities, who should be protected from the curious police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux made out of one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Because this calls for the state to use the means and to use the typical for a war. to this, the penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and to the object for "collateraldamage" and "withered balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or from, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas are still alive in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now, that police attacked the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho in order to store the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident also made headlines: a orcharist died as a result of shame who fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the Romanian organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Yzzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">In particular, the region East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons called the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practised by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these allegations have been controlled by rebels outside Damascus under siege, which led to that inhabitants have relied on local or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the longlasting blockade, traditional food products such as meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counteract, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own fungi as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and perform the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to conventional, in Syria, and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their foods makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right to the project, subscription Nabil, said to the French News Agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, like meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reported Global Voices that had been fighting for three years now that this project had been announced and pushed his relief, that it now wins more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use the NGO Ghiras Alas the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge of plantations to convey to Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they have reached over 100% of the expected target of approximately 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations up to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of fuel shortages, the fuel produced from plastics are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began to produce their quality from the regions of the regions, before they checked up their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom in a tub. as this was able, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "teaching farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a bigger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to teach human beings for various reasons": breakdown of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2825">Provision of a new food source on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Spread of a culture of self-sufficiency (such as paper, tea, coffee beans, cardboard, etc) are used for extraction of new food.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Creating new jobs, especially for women who work at home.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Creating new jobs for people with disabilities which are bound to their home.</seg>
<seg id="2829">He said, "We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible.</seg>
<seg id="2830">We want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity. "</seg>

<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral of the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper PÃºblico:</seg>

<seg id="2851">In addition, construction permits will be challenged at high brandrisiko at high brandrisiko.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-sufficient proposal for the whale-form, which had brought the government after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005, was growing by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle for investment.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environment-organization Quercus made it attentive that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of slightly bustible wood, like in a vicious circle, continues to spread the fires of this species.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago a terrible civil war erupted between the different Mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the Province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan during the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say it at that time so she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning of dawn, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban was getting closer to their hatred to the Hazara well-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohisrube. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that which was left of his low wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a strange country along with other refugees and towed bags with mortar, the heavier than he himself, to make his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we suspended nylon before the open window, so that we don't work out at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf made his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, running alone by the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice the day of food in charity.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high demand rates a type of second chance for emptied asylum seekers. it is also true, however, that conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of the asylum seekers is housed in more than 3000 "special entrance centers" in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission center if they have officially put an application for asylum - which can still be drawn after the registration of the asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then there are people who do not have money for an accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his stubborn lifestyle helped Asharaf soon to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made various work in construction industry for several years, Asharaf had its entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he opened a second hostel, and opened a Schnellimb after a while.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the topic of the "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghanistan operated companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of its restaurant Orient, in which the waiter and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from various parts of the world.</seg>
