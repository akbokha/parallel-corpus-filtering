this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
for a long before someone had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he has spectacular that the NSA has illeg@@ itim@@ ate teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic US intelligence intervention in which the CIA literally gave their designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter was not pleased ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and promp@@ ted him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , it became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and to condemn the journalists .
according to First Office , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right when media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ g , which they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters already did before him : he refused , and said he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was thus living with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , although they were many years that it would be essential for their case , the claims of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and rein@@ forcement to statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without being his consent , is concerned about his telephone conversation ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit information , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ cking source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government is home to a lot of work as home .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of giving a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
so , we put the press coverage in the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more possibilities to pi@@ v@@ ise all .
but just as technology the government permits to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can record it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ math .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen had written its book , and it is essentially more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source over@@ flow system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer that was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I &apos;ve been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload or send documents , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer describe information , and many of the information they would request would not be available from before .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world always develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous .
it is obvious to us that not only technology ken@@ ner like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to kill ini@@ quities . it is as important that we protect the next w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
the over abuse during the supply of soldiers are modest and of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to contam@@ inate the water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data le@@ vel@@ ing of the history was published . &#93; &#91; what does it mean &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; this week we were asked by news about an L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident law firm Mos@@ ch@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will receive an impression how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ ch@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &apos; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge that ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister is re@@ signed .
also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad issued bonds in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that there is a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , waiting for the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems weeping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that be done ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few few others to hide and make money -- something that we discuss in ten years and un@@ veil .
I think many people appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s difficult to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there has been no prominent Americans so far , that occurred in these revel@@ ations that sc@@ andal this sc@@ andal .
well , it is not so that there is no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax haven &apos;t work , mos@@ is Fon@@ se@@ ca has fewer American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs , less information is necessary to set up a company than to obtain a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed workers from school sources to run school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to be particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible to investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , the susp@@ ects money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked us to make suggestions for an attor@@ ney to our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money .
these were all accus@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course , nobody was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who sp@@ read@@ ed our secret investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ as@@ ion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very low @-@ sound , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing would have changed , as if the rich and mighty men will give .
but as a borro@@ wed optim@@ ist , I certainly see that some things began to change .
over the past few years , we have seen precau@@ tions to more transparency , affecting the owners of firms .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been covered in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US hin@@ der behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure in the U.S. and global for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lines .
we need executives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end through laws that type of in@@ transparency .
together , we can finally end up the in@@ transparency , which now enables this type of tax ev@@ as@@ ion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story how I was nearly kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be landed .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the Red Maz@@ da stayed and looked upon my stuff .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and just started a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him only ! he says he would go to peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plan this . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mat@@ ri@@ ze . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Come , how please ? &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ red the blanket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I find out there ?
a wild man sleeping in my living room .
what if it &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , at some pointed tips to the door , and my sleep door closed .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art , which he had purchased from me is now in its class@@ room . he is now teachers .
it was my first experience as a host . it has changed my angle of view .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers were , actually , friends who were only waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air@@ bed , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mat@@ ures .
let us make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can create , fear and turn fear .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ier Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I over@@ lays how we could earn something . our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mat@@ ri@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for $ 20 at the air mat@@ ri@@ ze on wood floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham mar@@ mel@@ ettes were completely different , because we made it for our guests .
we were touring with them throughout the whole city . when we were on our last guest and left the door to the castle , Brian and I went up .
had we just discovered that we will find new friends at the same time , and could pay our rent ?
things came to the roles .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ates , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors should be passing .
via the Internet , they can then invite strange people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but did not do it .
no one who is even in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned as children , strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , one can talk about the things that can be good . we could design@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create tru@@ sting with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we should .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will break out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone your left seat .
this quiet place of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what host will feel when they open the door first time .
because the only thing is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not just read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ lock mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
the most guests feel comfortable , if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
only once , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell phone now ?
could you please announ@@ cing Twitter that he dict@@ ates to the president of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced with his name ; if he had told how he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ als who all say : &quot; he really can hold on mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ known feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning , we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative denom@@ inations .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their ass@@ essments before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied , as probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are very similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social default .
it is exciting when you add to the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if you have less than three departments , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation of simil@@ arities .
the right design allows us to help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
you are talking too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , such as &quot; T@@ olle works in your apartment ! I &apos;m making a holiday with my family . &quot;
how to create this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give advice on what topics you should write .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
where@@ with we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us , business runs very well .
of course , there are times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have celebrated parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
guests have to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all telephone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when faith was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is hurt , if I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment , which was heard in the voice of the An@@ de@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million was only a fraction .
because people confi@@ de each other to each other .
if trust works , a wonder can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
it even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real protective gel to save one life , even though they don &apos;t know it at all .
you are driving a hospital in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they do not want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay a longer , without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay runs .
but these relations behind the pure cash action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sub@@ missions fit together with money transactions ?
it is about an economic trade .
but now it &apos;s just called &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not just the case .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what would be , however , if travelling is a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you have visited , a group there would wait to fill in a group there and to show a pub @-@ making quarters of which one has never heard ;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments for the reason ?
how would that look like ?
what would be , if cities would have the thought of the common share ?
I present cities in front of giving us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and depreciation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking places that belonged to the government ,
were now offered by the inhabitants . students who were looking for a lead ,
were con@@ veyed to people whose children were moved out . they were incub@@ ated , and were incub@@ ated .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are coming to a guest with a stranger or self @-@ host .
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality gave it even before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work right now ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the knowledge of confidence .
design can help us overcome deeper pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I like that amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
of course , we know that design is not able to solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a cereb@@ ral la@@ under@@ wear , a terrorist player ?
or simply a delay in the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
thus , the media represents them that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think of most would not have Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
to all those who have never met Muslims : it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ eg@@ ade fitness fan@@ ati@@ cian ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided that .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely against pressure that I felt as 17 year old to watch me a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have the Koran .
I read it , thought he thought , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow to de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone is perc@@ ei@@ ving you completely understands , and somehow she loves ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering .
later I had , after my marriage , a child , and living in the bottom of the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of them probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had folded at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flying in buildings , people wander@@ ing from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock turned back rapidly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do that ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; In the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; na@@ ve ... &quot; ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u changed me the acts of others by a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat place , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Not@@ with@@ standing in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; Don &apos;t curse you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for prayer .
again , the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or people who was thought to Muslims in the Free Trade and struck them .
there really was bran@@ dan@@ ese on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not felt right .
because the people , who had attacked this land , have attacked our country .
I have put the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it &apos;s not easy to explain . it &apos;s not easy to explain .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the ap@@ ologies that are hard .
nowadays we can hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to unite Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only is kept under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are Muslims , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but an important organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , sth@@ als and Olympics .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques Americas safer ?
there may be a few parking places , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit to a mosque leads to consider human beings more toler@@ ant , and greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC area recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in Mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radical process , it has found that it begins online . as a result , the person is cut off by their church , even by their family , the terrorists also believe that the terrorists were the true Muslim , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itors or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS is justified with the Koran .
as Muslim , mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their findings , if you recognize it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you throw a look at her , she doesn &apos;t drive what she las@@ ered in her &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding image told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him , because she would have had to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy concerning whom she spoke , she brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath , her sense for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that had been given to their rage , it was a key goal of the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that they promised a solution .
this image presented the connection to God and its church .
rather than to acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed their construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia , and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of anxiety affect our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we are afraid to pass at least three things .
we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if one reported test individuals news in which negative concerning Muslims were reported to agree rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only a ak@@ ade@@ mic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims go up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two voting periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not just about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was in the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was blo@@ wn and said :
&quot; when did you become such a experienced young man from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne on her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as with a execution , after he posted utter@@ ances against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism cannot be only moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we walked towards the mosque or stayed at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because we would like to leave our children to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion .
we opted for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw , I left myself .
the hall was completely filled .
then , Ima@@ m made an announcement , and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who were come to attack us , but to join us .
at this moment , I am broken together .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion toward panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
are you going to go on number ?
or will you connect to those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thinking of deep thinking , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the biggest ever carried out study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity to the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in any way .
when people appear as an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thanks a lot . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , shortly before , to become a billi@@ on@@ shop .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before the air package entered our social awareness , autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ro@@ pes .
by cl@@ amping , flight equipment achieve high speed and acceleration on narrow room .
they can also build self @-@ resi@@ li@@ gible structures .
you have learned to carry bur@@ dens , to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react to nature laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the possi@@ bile in the autonomous flight .
in order to create a system autonomous , it has to know where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory on the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands exist at the highest level of eb@@ e. e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flight unit trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other starters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most starters , it can float , and so great benefits at start and landing , and is very diverse .
however there is always a flip side .
a limitation of rear wheels is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t stop the optimal position , and the performance can be improved through exercise .
okay .
during our research , we often ask very basic abstract questions , to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which gathered together to viol@@ ate you .
before decades ago , pilots could fly controlled air @-@ controlled air@@ units that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder .
long ago we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control . it was invented in short ago .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no stap@@ les , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens in the inner life much , so it can be stable , and moving in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern . to bring it to the flies , I have to throw it right correctly .
the probability of throwing it right correctly when all of them see is low , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ internal is an exercise in practice , this machine is here , the omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , he is Mozambique in his alignment .
thereby he receives the external skill ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even as he rot@@ ates .
naturally , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propaganda .
some is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see it that way .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this is clock@@ wise .
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or battery -- can fly the machine , even if restricted .
we will demonstrate that , by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration studied synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit it with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as you want to exercise a flying lamp on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage is in development and creative act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , smart creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economical potential , the dot is on the i .
thank you very much .
more than 1,3 billion years ago in a very distant galaxy , two black holes are always qu@@ icker , they turned the mass of three s@@ uns in a tenth of pure energy .
for this short moment , it was brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole us known universe .
it was a very big pop .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ feeling itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
over 1.3 billion years ago , most of the population was originated in the earth .
since then the Earth has brought some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is up with us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly mu@@ d@@ -- Ra@@ i Weiss was decided by the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most they counted them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as a crazy gen@@ ius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
following decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry @-@ gra@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the detection performance .
therefore you call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the installation of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes was through the earth .
they went through you and me
and even through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my father &apos;s sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . it has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through ob@@ servatory like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cr@@ us@@ al in the feelings of space and time .
while passing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched in a direction , and the other hand gest@@ ed .
to illustr@@ ate , lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a sin@@ c@@ ous dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and gest@@ ed at the coming of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ as , followed by a 1 . this reason the Lig@@ o employee was going crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear program . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties with the construction of such det@@ ectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist are inv@@ entive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . because so , you can make a picture or a map of things to perceive the light of several points of future light around you .
in killing this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you especially much :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close to the story behind .
&quot; now Alice says . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make them any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by doing changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , Lig@@ o are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear it literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to l@@ ur@@ king , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott worked very long already .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very fast , you can hear the same cir@@ cling with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu .
it is a kind of movement of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget : &#91; Sur@@ render of noise &#93; J@@ No one who knows what he must hear , this is as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what that means .
two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each other a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it , because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o celebrates a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never possible .
on this path we can hear the space and hear the invisible .
much in all we can - practically or basically - do not see .
a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars are explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about all .
the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see , as these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ g@@ all : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the great sound is covered by its own reverse light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimi@@ stic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and from which we have never seen and of which we have no idea to discover , we are listening to .
in fact , Lig@@ o found the first run of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o she observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sour bone for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle of view on the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
before some time , I tried an experiment .
one year , I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid .
regardless of whether it made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
do I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on television ?
no , but yes !
did I start playing with the show ?
no , no , yes , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of what I was afraid , contempl@@ ated my fear .
my fear , to keep speech@@ es , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was certain Yes , which changed my life , to an unexpected article . it began with a question of mine .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Klein@@ ste , calls for un@@ explained reasons for all &quot; kit@@ ten , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my bar@@ gain . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was at the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
with a new life setting in my family . from there I am dre@@ amt to play with them , as soon as you are looking for me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve to try it very much .
it has a magical effect on me , upon my children , to our family .
but it also has a blo@@ oming side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ agen to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think of it , aw@@ aken for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for leaving 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days in four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows that are simultaneously in production , four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of this 70 TV @-@ hour are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ able . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who this is still doing ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work as hard as if you talk to a company , a country or a class@@ room , so you understand that I &apos;m not only on the computer , that I say : I understand that there is not dreams about dreams .
it is all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates always a country out of nothing .
it is when I set up the troops when I painted a screen .
as a dream , a great sound , a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and m@@ ingly , clin@@ ically and sensible , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when working works well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows like a busy street , I could always drive on her .
many people take the sum@@ s if I speak to them , that I may persu@@ ade the letter to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started to work and work with TV production when I started working and collabor@@ ating to create and cooperate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a bu@@ zz , then you cannot stri@@ ve differently than size .
the feeling that cannot be different to stri@@ ve than size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps there is also a work@@ a@@ bet .
perhaps there is gen@@ ius .
maybe it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more excessive limits , the more progress the more the same time , the more you watch me , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ load , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now , my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; kit@@ ten , I would like to go to Sh@@ onda Country . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are baby @-@ titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my job no more . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same thing as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours day , working week , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , does not exist , with all your heart , clear sight , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview of Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work that you love , suddenly hated ?
I know , some may think : &quot; hypo@@ l you , the author Titan . &quot;
but you know what you are doing , you &apos;re doing , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a ban@@ ker , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another , and knows how the sum@@ s feel when the sum@@ s stops , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Süd@@ states wa@@ it@@ in &quot; asks me a question .
I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I will tell No , when two things are conscious of me :
first , I have to say Yes to all and second , she called me not &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
they are called no more &quot; shame . &quot;
when is that happened ?
I leave it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters , we laugh much and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sw@@ inging , I can &apos;t do anything , except to custom@@ ize .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists are stick@@ y fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax pins and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
all everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and a energy boost comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work sum@@ s , the Titan@@ ens@@ um , that is just the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I say to you , who I am , I have been writing by shows and television hours and how working my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the vitality of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , demonstr@@ ating tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ears , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me God the false words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this as a fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ bet from every guilt .
it is a law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not an@@ sat@@ in to me as working .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I &apos;m still working because I love it .
I prefer better at the workplace as home .
this objec@@ tion is painful , as for a man rather than to be home ?
well , I think .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am , none of it .
we shave in the garden , back and back , and now .
we make little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ orted soap bubbles .
I feel that mainly stei@@ f , absent and confused .
I always hold on my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the playing ?
they can also say it ! do you always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll keep me for na@@ i@@ v , for a meeting woman .
you probably have right , but you can also do it !
they have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they fall into something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ e@@ fer or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
and speak my te@@ ens daughter about 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need it not .
each can get 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood @-@ day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile , no washing , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my charity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul &apos;s peace .
it &apos;s not about games with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; games &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I am fail@@ ing and I wins . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why do not allow full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens up and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , they comp@@ lies me and my soul . I lead me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the bu@@ zz is not I ... no more .
soap bubbles and stick@@ y fingers , dinners with friends .
that is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but only one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ ed to me that I am a Titan . I never saw a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier are I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country that I run , the marathon , I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more it makes this unusual , lasting , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think of things , I aw@@ aken you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
Titan@@ nets have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
sure , they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; in which you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits on the neur@@ ons that improves neuro@@ logical function .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which had suffered severe trem@@ or and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was a consultant , working day and night in the emergency department .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ mat@@ a , you need to restri@@ ct the brain and incl@@ ined to the skull pressure .
to save life , one has to reduce the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a partially s@@ wollen mass mass sometimes .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen body mass , we determined to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells from a gun to grow , is comparable to small children who are taken out of their families .
you need to find the correct food , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean François succeeded .
that he looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
maybe you know from the Bi@@ ological Study that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves in every cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain compound in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they sat slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but remained differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ tic in positive cells .
we all have them in our bra@@ ins .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ rum cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they worry about the f@@ ission of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in healing the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source , enabling brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of bra@@ ins from the non @-@ language range and then remove the cells exactly as cultivation as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then marked color , in order to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the discovery of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged cereb@@ ral tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ gh@@ s we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after several weeks they would have been taken completely , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury to and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now they remained the cells -- they were up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these little points . these are the cells that we paint in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual business task .
they had to take food pellets of one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we added the mot@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex to the hand@@ mot@@ ics range .
so the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they re@@ covering spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic bra@@ in@@ mechanisms . you recover to a certain degree , just like the apes .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , who spont@@ aneously took spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now let &apos;s see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation plant .
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are , before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest bar@@ riers are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : it is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it takes you to get into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on approval of clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate it if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first , you have to re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us .
BG : thanks a lot .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake , it can be seen as self .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant , which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable op@@ enness .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leading democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have definitely proved that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- our elections -- does not affect the austerity programmes which were implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebellious friends who would repeat me if they would change anything .
at this point , I want to introduce you an economical model for a real democracy .
I ask you to believe in together with me again , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group , we could save money , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
because without democracy our societies are common , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened with our host .
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . you know and recognise it as the debt mountain that raises his long shadow over the United States , Europe , and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few know his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ worn cash , which are to be anxi@@ ous to invest it , however , to invest where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt mountain and could also produce all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months were invested in the US , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
a total of 3.4 trillion dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the same time in the same countries and financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices rise .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital make the twin peaks , not equal through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and thus a low macro@@ economic demand that would not be investing in which they will not invest . exactly like est@@ ial Father who would not be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances causes that oil kills him .
that is my heart with capitalism --
its extremely waste art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are crucial for salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form , in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , concluded many of them --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these connections .
the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they only en@@ acted the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more import@@ antly and crucial to them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights in questions of state reserves .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very light , it is also quickly burned .
however , our present @-@ liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but at Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy strengthened himself on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a who ultimately became a stat@@ ute for the ruling .
for the liberal democracy only came up when a full separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process was possible , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a Democr@@ ati@@ e@@ free zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that the separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ her@@ ed@@ itary struggle between the two , pursued by the economy gradually depri@@ ved of politics .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no more like that ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is estimated that one may be in the government today , and yet , not in power , because the power of politics into the economy is isolated and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a herd of prey that feeds as sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy which is so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations is increasing , economic demand falls , and the managing director of corporations are de@@ pressed to invest the cash of their company .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour and the wealth of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , like in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the mar@@ x@@ ist left had this idea before 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very strange .
the doctrine of de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ loading capacities by autom@@ ating automation and robot .
the problem is that , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the autom@@ ating the twin peaks can be higher , the waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
we have to re @-@ adapt the economy and policies again , and make sure we democr@@ ats the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will end in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ atie , which lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary appear .
thus , the question is not whether capitalism has engine@@ ered the technical achievements , which he has brought forth --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life .
I think we must be optimi@@ stic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ such utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia &quot; ?
in practical implementation , I would like to call you in all , some examples .
in the area of enterprises : ask for a capital market in which one works , while you are working and in your capital you will follow you from a work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter which one has just works -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
all in@@ comes from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees who do not belong there . no exchange attract more between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and expenses , and ultimately no emp@@ tied twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please indicate that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each Government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the commercial net of the country , into a joint fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment products are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally fav@@ oured , in which they are privileged individuals , and mar@@ x@@ ist@@ ically , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the history of the history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we are awak@@ ening in such a world
or will we fall into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ orial Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... do we do not do it , the technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand , which is called Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is very relevant ,
as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes I am also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the perspective of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the licence of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely Democr@@ ati@@ e@@ free zone .
in a certain way , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative that China is still similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can now observe in China , resem@@ bles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now being called to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as finance ministers in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I noticed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not just Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , from the self @-@ ordin@@ ation to say goodbye , and continuing deteri@@ oration that a massive se@@ wer@@ age line passed through the Eurozone , and continues to overthrow the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal , who revealed this den@@ ial --
right . unfortunately , the forces within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ying the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to obtain a economic system , which is not viable , by political will and Auth@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism in life , it might perhaps be delayed for a while , but if then the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what change will you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t have a future if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- harvest@@ ing ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister there , who , after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he did not make mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I have made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t there .
they only wanted to bring our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the ver@@ wer@@ ies that ran through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astro@@ phic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one out of the Tro@@ ika of the funds imposed us this policy , said : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ ano@@ inting mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tape of the conversations , you still seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone fell from somebody who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
for if they do not survive , the de@@ formed ti@@ f@@ forces will be ro@@ lic@@ ally and destroy the European Union .
this will not be cat@@ astro@@ phic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we probably are the strongest economy in the world .
if we examine ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong to lie in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
Roy Price hasn &apos;t heard anything yet , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago .
Roy Price is Senior Manager at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slender , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for it to produce shows and content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting sector .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right to this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating shows from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this evaluation .
becomes your show with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to make your brain asks : &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- it should be enough to tell you what about this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take care of getting on the left side of the curve , because I already have a special intelligence to under@@ take &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he does more thoughts about the middle evaluation , the average TV -- shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not enth@@ r@@ alled .
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something , so Roy Price wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts for an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online wherever they can look at each charge .
and if Amazon is free of charge , you get to , right ?
millions of viewers are looking at these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched at watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who receive everything .
you capture when you start the show , when you check out what parts can be ski@@ pped or check again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and this makes the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember that show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of these curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- a bit above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
around the same time , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly as Roy is always searching for this a super @-@ show and he uses data for it , but it makes it something different .
instead of opening a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like what producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has always landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data @-@ sealed firms .
they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is that ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision which you meet , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years to statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimised by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ arest thing you can expect is good television , right ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is something frigh@@ tening because we are living in a while we are living in more and more , to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software , you are in prison .
if someone is here in the US in prison and asking for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is carried out or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided if a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that is not that a company does not know how multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
also the data se@@ eded companies are un@@ true .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted through data analysis of flu , serious species , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news source . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the journal Nature &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until suddenly no longer worked ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , it was once again a sensation , including the release of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data se@@ eded companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
in spite of all these mistakes , data occur in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in medicine , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , like the decision for a cancer treatment
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some pattern using the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
to solve a complex problem , you are mainly doing two things :
as a decree , you can analyse this problem in its single parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , set the single parts together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and set up again .
and now most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts together and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete to put a good decision -- especially if the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been capable of . but the decision to set up all these parts , set up a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that &apos;s not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
however , Amazon did this on the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they had competitive around TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things run wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to do that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it existed , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you have to shake only the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I &apos;ll get it later with a technical demo .
so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in the afternoon .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them by something much wis@@ ely sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it lies in us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I sensitive this as a very encouraging message , that despite the great amount of data still paying out to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing , and risks to take risks .
by the end , it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
