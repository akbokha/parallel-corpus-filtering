<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">For a long before someone had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he has spectacular that the NSA has illegitimate telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence intervention in which the CIA literally gave their designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter was not pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and prompted him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, it became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblower and to condemn the journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Office, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right when media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mug, which they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him: he refused, and said he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen was thus living with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were many years that it would be essential for their case, the claims of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and reinforcement to statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without being his consent, is concerned about his telephone conversation,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit information, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and cracking source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government is home to a lot of work as home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of giving a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press coverage in the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more possibilities to pivise all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology the government permits to handle the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can record it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written when Risen had written its book, and it is essentially more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source overflow system for Whistleblower that was originally developed by the Internet's famous Aaron Swartz, and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I've been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload or send documents, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer describe information, and many of the information they would request would not be available from before.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world always develop new spy technologies that are all dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is obvious to us that not only technology kenner like Edward Snowden have a possibility to kill iniquities. it is as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The over abuse during the supply of soldiers are modest and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to contaminate the water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leveling of the history was published.] [what does it mean] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to a statement.] this week we were asked by news about an Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's resident law firm Moschca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Moschbag Fonseca go and say: 'okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of news, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad issued bonds in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that there is a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, waiting for the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that be done?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few few others to hide and make money -- something that we discuss in ten years and unveil.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears very confusing this whole world, and it's difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there has been no prominent Americans so far, that occurred in these revelations that scandal this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there is no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax haven't work, mosis Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs, less information is necessary to set up a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States has allowed workers from school sources to run school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to be particularly susceptible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African ministers, the suspects money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us to make suggestions for an attorney to our investigators, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all accusations. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course, nobody was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who spreaded our secret investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politiker involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very low-sound, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing would have changed, as if the rich and mighty men will give.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist, I certainly see that some things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen precautions to more transparency, affecting the owners of firms.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been covered in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US hinder behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure in the U.S. and global for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlines.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that arise and say: "Intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end through laws that type of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end up the intransparency, which now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I was nearly kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the Red Mazda stayed and looked upon my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just started a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him only! he says he would go to peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plan this. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air matrize. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Come, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I starred the blanket and thought: "Oh man! what did I find out there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild man sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, at some pointed tips to the door, and my sleep door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he had purchased from me is now in its classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it has changed my angle of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers were, actually, friends who were only waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my airbed, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air matures.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create, fear and turn fear.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow occupier Brian Chesky: "Brian, I overlays how we could earn something. our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air matrize and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for $20 at the air matrize on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham marmelettes were completely different, because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We were touring with them throughout the whole city. when we were on our last guest and left the door to the castle, Brian and I went up.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we will find new friends at the same time, and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommates, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors should be passing.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can then invite strange people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is even in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, one can talk about the things that can be good. we could designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trusting with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we should.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will break out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet place of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what host will feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not just read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlock mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">The most guests feel comfortable, if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who actually has Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announcing Twitter that he dictates to the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced with his name; if he had told how he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 Beurals who all say: "he really can hold on mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-known feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative denominations.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assessments before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are very similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social default.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add to the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three departments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design allows us to help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">You are talking too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle works in your apartment! I'm making a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give advice on what topics you should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">Wherewith we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have celebrated parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Guests have to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all telephone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when faith was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is hurt, if I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which was heard in the voice of the Andefer, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million was only a fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people confide each other to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, a wonder can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">It even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective gel to save one life, even though they don't know it at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You are driving a hospital in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay a longer, without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay runs.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure cash action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of submissions fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now it's just called "rental industry," the thing is not just the case.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, if travelling is a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you have visited, a group there would wait to fill in a group there and to show a pub-making quarters of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments for the reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be, if cities would have the thought of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present cities in front of giving us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking places that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered by the inhabitants. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. they were incubated, and were incubated.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries are coming to a guest with a stranger or self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality gave it even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work right now?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the knowledge of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeper prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I like that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design is not able to solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a cerebral launderwear, a terrorist player?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus, the media represents them that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think of most would not have Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">To all those who have never met Muslims: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealegade fitness fanatician,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to wear Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely against pressure that I felt as 17 year old to watch me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought he thought, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow to devotion that deepened with each reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone is perceiving you completely understands, and somehow she loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later I had, after my marriage, a child, and living in the bottom of the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of them probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had folded at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flying in buildings, people wandering from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical error?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned back rapidly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"... "..." In the name of Islam... "..."... "nave..."... "...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu changed me the acts of others by a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat place, and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Be careful," "Notwithstanding in well-lighted areas," Don't curse you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">Again, the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw my extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or people who was thought to Muslims in the Free Trade and struck them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was brandanese on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people, who had attacked this land, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have put the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It's not easy to explain. it's not easy to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the apologies that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to unite Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor only is kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are Muslims, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, sthals and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques Americas safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking places, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque leads to consider human beings more tolerant, and greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC area recently told: people are actually not radicalised in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radical process, it has found that it begins online. as a result, the person is cut off by their church, even by their family, the terrorists also believe that the terrorists were the true Muslim, and everyone who abhorred their behaviour and ideology, is a traitors or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS is justified with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, mother, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their findings, if you recognize it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throw a look at her, she doesn't drive what she lasered in her "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding image told me recently an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she would have had to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was just the opposite. every clergy concerning whom she spoke, she brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath, her sense for injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had been given to their rage, it was a key goal of the instrumentalization by extremists that they promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This image presented the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than to accuse them for their anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, like the Islamophobia, and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of anxiety affect our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we are afraid to pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reported test individuals news in which negative concerning Muslims were reported to agree rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only a akademic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims go up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two voting periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not just about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was in the dental Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was blown and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did you become such a experienced young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne on her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as with a execution, after he posted utterances against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism cannot be only moral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we walked towards the mosque or stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because we would like to leave our children to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw, I left myself.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, Imam made an announcement, and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were come to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment, I am broken together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion toward panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TEDTalk, a thinking of deep thinking, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't fool you. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the biggest ever carried out study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception to rule, then the rule is usually broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thanks a lot. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, shortly before, to become a billionshop.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package entered our social awareness, autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By clamping, flight equipment achieve high speed and acceleration on narrow room.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-resiligible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to carry burdens, to deal with turbulence and to react to nature laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the possibile in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to create a system autonomous, it has to know where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory on the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands exist at the highest level of ebe. e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and so great benefits at start and landing, and is very diverse.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear wheels is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't stop the optimal position, and the performance can be improved through exercise.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask very basic abstract questions, to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which gathered together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Before decades ago, pilots could fly controlled air-controlled airunits that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Long ago we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control. it was invented in short ago.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No staples, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens in the inner life much, so it can be stable, and moving in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern. to bring it to the flies, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right correctly when all of them see is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinternal is an exercise in practice, this machine is here, the omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, he is Mozambique in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the external skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it that way.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or battery -- can fly the machine, even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as you want to exercise a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wage is in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there are creative, smart creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economical potential, the dot is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">More than 1,3 billion years ago in a very distant galaxy, two black holes are always quicker, they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, it was brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the whole us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time-feeling itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Over 1.3 billion years ago, most of the population was originated in the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has brought some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is up with us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly mud-- Rai Weiss was decided by the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise about colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they counted them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as a crazy genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">Following decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: laser interferometry-graservatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you call him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run by some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the installation of the detector, the gravitational shafts of the two collizing black holes was through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And even through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my father's sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. it has been studied gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatory like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a crusal in the feelings of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched in a direction, and the other hand gested.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses for relativity theory often lead to a sincous dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and gested at the coming of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros according to the commas, followed by a 1. this reason the Ligo employee was going crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured at less than a thousandths of a nuclear program. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves: "the technical difficulties with the construction of such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims, Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so, you can make a picture or a map of things to perceive the light of several points of future light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean to you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close to the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice says."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make them any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by doing changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, Ligo are the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear it literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to lurking, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott worked very long already.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast, you can hear the same circling with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu.</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget: [Surrender of noise] JNo one who knows what he must hear, this is as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each other a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it, because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo celebrates a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can hear the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can - practically or basically - do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars are explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur in the core, which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urgall: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the great sound is covered by its own reverse light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitation waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and from which we have never seen and of which we have no idea to discover, we are listening to.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found the first run of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo she observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour bone for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different angle of view on the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatory on earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Before some time, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year, I would say to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of whom I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Regardless of whether it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes".</seg>
<seg id="557">Do I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, yes, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of what I was afraid, contemplated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was certain Yes, which changed my life, to an unexpected article. it began with a question of mine.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Kleinste, calls for unexplained reasons for all "kitten,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my bargain."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her, when I was at the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">With a new life setting in my family. from there I am dreamt to play with them, as soon as you are looking for me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive to try it very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, upon my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blooming side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" Sagen to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think of it, awaken for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for leaving 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days in four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows that are simultaneously in production, four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of this 70 TV-hour are broadcasts that I created myself, and not only produced, so still obendable. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work as hard as if you talk to a company, a country or a classroom, so you understand that I'm not only on the computer, that I say: I understand that there is not dreams about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates always a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up the troops when I painted a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream, a great sound, a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and mingly, clinically and sensible, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working works well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows like a busy street, I could always drive on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take the sums if I speak to them, that I may persuade the letter to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started to work and work with TV production when I started working and collaborating to create and cooperate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a buzz, then you cannot strive differently than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that cannot be different to strive than size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps there is also a workabet.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps there is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I know only that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more excessive limits, the more progress the more the same time, the more you watch me, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overload, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kitten, I would like to go to Shonda Country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same thing as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours day, working week, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, does not exist, with all your heart, clear sight, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview of Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work that you love, suddenly hated?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "hypol you, the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you are doing, you're doing, one loves to be a teacher, a banker to be a banker, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another, and knows how the sums feel when the sums stops, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Südstates waitin" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way out, late and she says, "Mama, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will tell No, when two things are conscious of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all and second, she called me not "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">They are called no more "shame."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I leave it when I am Titan and my sums, and here everything changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters, we laugh much and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of swinging, I can't do anything, except to customize.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, wax pins and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">All everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the work sums, the Titanensum, that is just the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I say to you, who I am, I have been writing by shows and television hours and how working my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the vitality of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, demonstrating tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ears, but perhaps whispered me God the false words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workabet from every guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not ansatin to me as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I'm still working because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer better at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This objection is painful, as for a man rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I think.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am, none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We shave in the garden, back and back, and now.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We shorted soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel that mainly steif, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always hold on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">They can also say it! do you always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you'll keep me for naiv, for a meeting woman.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they fall into something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkefer or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teens daughter about 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can get 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my charity, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul's peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about games with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I am failing and I wins. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why do not allow full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens up and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, they complies me and my soul. I lead me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the buzz is not I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but only one part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snued to me that I am a Titan. I never saw a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier are I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country that I run, the marathon, I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sums, the other, the sums of life: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more it makes this unusual, lasting, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think of things, I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titannets have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure, they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "Tiefenhirnstimulation." in which you implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits on the neurons that improves neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which had suffered severe tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was a consultant, working day and night in the emergency department.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at the skull-Hirn traumata, you need to restrict the brain and inclined to the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a partially swollen mass mass sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen body mass, we determined to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from a gun to grow, is comparable to small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the correct food, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">That he looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know from the Biological Study that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves in every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain compound in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They sat slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but remained differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublectic in positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brains.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus, they worry about the fission of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in healing the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source, enabling brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brains from the non-language range and then remove the cells exactly as cultivation as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then marked color, in order to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the discovery of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in damaged cerebral tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Roughs we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after several weeks they would have been taken completely, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury to and implanted exactly the same cells and now they remained the cells -- they were up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these little points. these are the cells that we paint in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual business task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets of one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable dexterity level, we added the motic cortex to the handmotics range.</seg>
<seg id="869">So the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovering spontaneously to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brainmechanisms. you recover to a certain degree, just like the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, who spontaneously took spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now let's see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation plant.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest barriers are the authorities. based on these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it takes you to get into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate it if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you have to reprove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake, it can be seen as self.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable openness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have definitely proved that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- our elections -- does not affect the austerity programmes which were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who would repeat me if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I want to introduce you an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in together with me again, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup, we could save money, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies are common, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened with our host.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and recognise it as the debt mountain that raises his long shadow over the United States, Europe, and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unworn cash, which are to be anxious to invest it, however, to invest where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt mountain and could also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months were invested in the US, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">A total of 3.4 trillion dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until one compares it to the same time in the same countries and financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices rise.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital make the twin peaks, not equal through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and thus a low macroeconomic demand that would not be investing in which they will not invest. exactly like estial Father who would not be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally, the circumstances causes that oil kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my heart with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely waste art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially all the technologies, "green" technologies, which are crucial for salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form, in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, concluded many of them --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Athenian democracy due to these connections.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that they only enacted the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly and crucial to them the right to political co-determination with equal voting rights in questions of state reserves.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very light, it is also quickly burned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But at Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy strengthened himself on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta who ultimately became a statute for the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up when a full separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process was possible, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a Democratiefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that the separation of politics and economy began, an inhereditary struggle between the two, pursued by the economy gradually deprived of politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no more like that?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is estimated that one may be in the government today, and yet, not in power, because the power of politics into the economy is isolated and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about as a herd of prey that feeds as sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy which is so far cannibalized, that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations is increasing, economic demand falls, and the managing director of corporations are depressed to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism expels the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour and the wealth of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, like in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist left had this idea before 100 years ago and it wasn't very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-loading capacities by automating automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automating the twin peaks can be higher, the waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">We have to re-adapt the economy and policies again, and make sure we democrats the reunified area, otherwise we will end in a disease monitoring hyperautocratie, which lets the film "Matrix" as a documentary appear.</seg>
<seg id="957">Thus, the question is not whether capitalism has engineered the technical achievements, which he has brought forth --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -such utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar Dystopia "?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to call you in all, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of enterprises: ask for a capital market in which one works, while you are working and in your capital you will follow you from a workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter which one has just works -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">All incomes from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees who do not belong there. no exchange attract more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and expenses, and ultimately no emptied twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please indicate that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each Government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the commercial net of the country, into a joint fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment products are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is at the same time liberally favoured, in which they are privileged individuals, and marxistically, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the history of the history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall into a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertorial Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and the economy is... do we do not do it, the technological development will create a massive decline in total economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is very relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the perspective of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the licence of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely Democratiefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say so provocative that China is still similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now observe in China, resembles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now being called to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells huge according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance ministers in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I noticed that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not just Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, from the self-ordination to say goodbye, and continuing deterioration that a massive sewerage line passed through the Eurozone, and continues to overthrow the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal, who revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Right. unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to denying the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to obtain a economic system, which is not viable, by political will and Authoritarianism in life, it might perhaps be delayed for a while, but if then the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change will you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't have a future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- harvesting...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister there, who, after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he did not make mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I have made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that wasn't there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the verweries that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one out of the Troika of the funds imposed us this policy, said: "that was a colosanointing mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive tape of the conversations, you still seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone fell from somebody who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the deformed tifforces will be rolically and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We probably are the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we examine ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans and the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong to lie in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much for you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price hasn't heard anything yet, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is Senior Manager at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for it to produce shows and content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fighting sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right to this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating shows from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Becomes your show with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to make your brain asks: "where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows are shows like "Toddlers and tiaras" -- -- it should be enough to tell you what about this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take care of getting on the left side of the curve, because I already have a special intelligence to undertake "Toddlers and tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He does more thoughts about the middle evaluation, the average TV -- shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not enthralled.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it something, so Roy Price wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects for an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online wherever they can look at each charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free of charge, you get to, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are looking at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched at watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show, when you check out what parts can be skipped or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and this makes the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember that show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of these curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- a bit above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Around the same time, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. exactly as Roy is always searching for this a super-show and he uses data for it, but it makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of opening a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has always landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data-sealed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision which you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimised by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindearest thing you can expect is good television, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we are living in a while we are living in more and more, to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is here in the US in prison and asking for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided if a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that is not that a company does not know how multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data seeded companies are untrue.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted through data analysis of flu, serious species, predictions -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news source. the success gifted in a publication in the journal Nature "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, it was once again a sensation, including the release of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data seeded companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these mistakes, data occur in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in medicine, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, like the decision for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some pattern using the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">To solve a complex problem, you are mainly doing two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a decree, you can analyse this problem in its single parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, set the single parts together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and set up again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete to put a good decision -- especially if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they would not have been capable of. but the decision to set up all these parts, set up a show like "House of Cards," that's not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">However, Amazon did this on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they had competitive around TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things run wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to do that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it existed, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you have to shake only the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them by something much wisely sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it lies in us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I sensitive this as a very encouraging message, that despite the great amount of data still paying out to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing, and risks to take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">By the end, it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
