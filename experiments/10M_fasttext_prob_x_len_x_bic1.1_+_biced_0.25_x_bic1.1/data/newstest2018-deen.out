Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers generate the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories for days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not currently current .
this knows everyone , who had to be very exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place instead of a circum@@ vent road a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atl@@ antique , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in Bavaria of the state government , are all other than currently - yet highly recommended .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a tile carpet , which one cannot recognize as such .
in the great coverage map were conceived for cities and municipalities in detailed maps , so @-@ called primitive leaves .
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying management between 1810 and 1864 and jumping the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
in the spring of 1800 , French armies occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops re@@ signed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , it was the present neighbours that created the idea of a country @-@ wide Bayern map .
Kur@@ für@@ st@@ Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Association Administration .
the original certificate for Munich is from the year 1856 , and is like all others to find on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ send@@ ling , which still appears relatively isolated in the 1856 card .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the map of the map , i.e. 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ contra@@ sted by 1856 along today &apos;s shopping street , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : in zo@@ oming appears a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
small plots spread there today no farmers more - but small gar@@ dener to the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is drawn north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , 1810 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the original position , the Au @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen district is not only reading the street names &quot; at Gast@@ eig , &quot; or from the altitude &quot; On the air , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one opened once people with mad@@ ness .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; was founded in 1858 / 59 .
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard of G@@ ud@@ den presi@@ ded the facility - the psychiat@@ rist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and finished for example the anch@@ ov@@ ing of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he taught the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients had been first place , later was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity wasn &apos;t enough anymore - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair of 1905 .
since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist .
you@@ ths now encounter adolescents at the Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and went into a youth home with educational establishments .
located west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential homes from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co , &quot; was built in an architectural association with the roots of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance building , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 1856 as a &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ erst@@ raße name was &quot; Kauf@@ inger Gasse . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of coin .
the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - on Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 will be the sp@@ at@@ balls for the second S @-@ Bahn station .
with the sli@@ p@@ eg@@ ler , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole in the Mari@@ enhof hole .
civil Rights Group publishes dis@@ armament for Missouri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ ming has issued a warning for colored people who travel due to discrimin@@ ating policy and rac@@ ist attacks in the state of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Advisory Council for the state of Missouri until August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to be carried out on journeys through the state special attention and to be noted , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based occurr@@ ences in the whole state can be observed and here , &quot; said it in the opinion of the group .
a recently attempted law of Missouri , which makes people more difficult to claim discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate minority interests , the group , the travel agency , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have bre@@ aches the rights of civil rights to humans .
they are stopped due to their skin color , they are crushed or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group z@@ iti@@ oned inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime .
the Council also has shown on a recently published report of the offices of the General Prosecutor &apos;s office , in which black car drivers will be 75 percent more common in the state .
&quot; the recommendation is that human beings are aware of their families , friends and employees informed about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; the people must be willing to bring justice money or the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in the year 2015 , after the latest figures from the hate @-@ breaking report of the FBI , who enters the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel is also an answer to a new Missouri Act which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the EU immigration authorities agreed to negoti@@ ate people because of mig@@ rat@@ ory organs , which is to contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U account for further retirement schemes .
travel accounts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
consecr@@ ated project is elem@@ ental
the f@@ ender f@@ fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have purchased a picture on the spot .
at the right excav@@ ation of the family of Schwen@@ demann , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ acher CDU @-@ Mun@@ ich@@ ands came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ demann first granted insights into his operation in which he accommod@@ ates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; is the alternative solution for him for the milk of his cows , as swi@@ vel .
on the table of the Feri@@ h@@ ott@@ est comes exclusively regional .
since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can do not profit on such steep areas .
the green area care for much work , much must be mach@@ ined with the engine sense .
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and to fight with the top@@ ography , &quot; he emphas@@ ized .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ eventh operation and maintained this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it did not lead a biodiversity .
for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the meaning of the consecr@@ ation project and is glad about the leader @-@ promoting . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the read@@ ings of the surfaces could still be moved out for a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture , and consider thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; the mayor was stressed .
farmers are often standing because of promoting often in cr@@ iti@@ que
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure area is thus 40 hectares , which can not be checked up to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of € 71 million , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter led to the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
the farmers remaining 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; declared swi@@ vel .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
also for Peter White stand firm : &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Force ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the fore@@ front is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded conveyor belts .
moreover , the appropriate surface should not be economical ( hang@@ ar over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by ref@@ us@@ ation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ acher Soft Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build barely 16 kilometres of fence .
the dis@@ closure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cost @-@ contained costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the car@@ c@@ ingly staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN about the proposals of President for the dra@@ stic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller handle not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have landed him if he had done it .
but he handle their importance , and especially the meaning that you were attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta imp@@ lied : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that enlighten@@ ed the world .
the poem , which you refer to which later was added , not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively righ@@ tly , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the bla@@ zing words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only charges any old immigrants , but the arms of the poor : &quot; your garbage , your arms , and your oppressed masses , who are going to be free to breathe freely , the el@@ end waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , showing the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in a un@@ used classical image representation .
Lazarus modified this meaning : in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and they themselves have a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change it long for a long time .
the great Schrei@@ er Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is allowed to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes on .
it aims to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not give the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and even a question of the Stand@@ ing point of perception .
the great fantasy indeed of Lazarus was in it to see how it was seen from the exhausted , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips to the de@@ cks of ships .
it goes in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve life .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to know .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine on the way , but hate hatred , who is the only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black Pra@@ ise Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle looks at a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team .
the performance director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship &quot; will afford a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ lete think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the circumstances of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ p@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her surrender speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or whatever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie very naturally brought , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; unbelie@@ v@@ ably &quot; that 16 shots in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ route Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m is another Scot@@ sman to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle looks at her first world championships , as the only other shot in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enormous &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about the Team capit@@ als is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well established athletes , athletes , who want to rise in poets .
what is my speech as a capitalist ?
yes , I think it was good .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to use this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will be just such a great atmosphere . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you don &apos;t use the deposit of voters .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from internal politics to its political principles .
he imp@@ aired criticism , certainly .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; The freedom of expression can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we will be led as sheep for battles . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an , who must work in it to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
at the beginning of this week , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union appe@@ aled him to the beginning of this week .
the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; there is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it &apos;s a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second @-@ seat approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary he@@ at@@ head .
he has shown a solid hand at the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his site .
therefore , the block of persons appearing on the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially , and of staff that will be paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary , and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ man Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse dra@@ fted the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of Tro@@ ll@@ s or chambers or h@@ ass@@ aul@@ ed people who sw@@ inging the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest filed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD , was not h@@ ass@@ able , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; wrote them in the comments section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people on the same topic , then they are recognized by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
as the staff of the governor as &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ Attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to use a message by blocking a critic or delete a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than in previous time , when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ les and to kill or make protest@@ ers to silence and silence .
but it just happens .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ises that he critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is pro@@ claiming by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she was appointed a elec@@ torate of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt has received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail@@ boxes beat on his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous consol@@ es .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
pet@@ ition@@ ing , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and shipping with Britain critic@@ ised his position , according to the historical documents , collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not have her silence .
freedom of expression , freedom of opinion and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership signi@@ fies that to accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope to hope in the next three days at home comforts , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian is hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led to the final year next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ unde , is connected to the new venue and served as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best site , he is in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous dis@@ col@@ oration of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels especially true , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open in the year after I had won it out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came after his 50th birthday earlier this year at the European Senior Tour , returns to the promotion back home .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how things went to . &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six shots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking lot is £ 5 per car with passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all revenues go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up an own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove themselves as a very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger Road are in full swing and &quot; lie down in time , &quot; says head of the Bau@@ haus Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house@@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much the mountains , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which is repeatedly handic@@ apped the construction work , represents a big problem for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze .
the road was locked and only the bus buses are entitled to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
but fortunately , we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with delicious mineral water , &quot; tells Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , it doesn &apos;t use a cooker .
it even uses rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ age in the near Indonesian province , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the carbon@@ ated buttons is taken with e@@ ager , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she runs their daily work , for example clothes with a cloudy waters out of the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room is as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband , there were no fields assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink difficult , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; no one wants to walk after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the hig@@ hlands of Papua New Zealand , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement that touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turning fast against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua New Guinea , the independent part of Papua New Guinea counted the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so se@@ clu@@ ded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation services .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ ambo@@ o @-@ f@@ ences , and from corrugated plates that were converted into different yellow tones by rust in different yellow tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .

Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a Hoch@@ land@@ provincial capital in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua New resources is valued at an estimated $ 78 billion dollar .
however , these riches are a source of affliction to Papua New Guinea that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military preser@@ ves an initial presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic claims for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden G@@ ans and will be treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists of activists , more than 500,000 babies have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indonesian Military , tortured and imprisoned .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as family @-@ high land in the 1970 @-@ 1920@@ s were used in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .

&quot; the migrants started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old pan@@ i@@ ai native to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; cost from Papua - its market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowds and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua New campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New has changed little , and today the natives feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorbike .
the frigh@@ tened children said to them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone and returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers hum@@ ili@@ ated into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was placed on fire and the things escal@@ ated next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field before the local police station and the military service center to demand justice .
they contributed cereb@@ ral hun@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ sigh@@ ting - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators started to@@ wing stones at police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent a command via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released in local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and urged the amount to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
when I turned around , I suddenly shot up into my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball from the ranks of the ranks were gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired . &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , who was witness of the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and investigate his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is named as many Indonesian , the TIM@@ E in glo@@ omy atmosphere .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the head spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to save their station only &quot; secure , &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
in the three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for families of victims and s@@ ware , to walk historical vest@@ ments in Papua New Guinea .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he establishes a extra@@ judicial mechanism to establish historical rights ab@@ uses .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation started almost immediately .
&quot; most of them have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that need to run through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto showed a retreat when he spoke in Jak@@ arta on June 5 in Jak@@ arta with the TIM@@ E and said he has no plans to set up a complaint in Papua New Guinea .
instead &quot; everything is regulated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto that accused the UN for crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor &apos;s blood@@ less independence of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already settled in Papua New , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai preliminary .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims by Gri@@ mm@@ ers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in panic attacks to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; when I had buried the bodies , the military looked after me , &quot; he says .
the sh@@ ot@@ ers have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
pre@@ controlled vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , which re@@ acted by warning warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives in the hospital and witness how the injured here is quickly delivered , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the officers involved and withdraw the police Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a hot herd for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green Highlands of Papua New Guinea .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua New , by removing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to the recent years thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never appear again .
among the people in Papua New Guinea Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic , forgotten location . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as a range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a made only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua New and the new migrants who have arrived since the opening of new gro@@ oves to the airport Nab@@ ire in a larger number .
the few jobs , which exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants .
Papua have rarely the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
isolation holds the eyes of the world from Papua New Guinea .
in addition , limitations of reporting international media are banned .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New , although rare permission was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , were not able to raise the limitations of reporting to enhance transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ poll@@ est provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
a lack of press control means that international pressure remains restricted to the Indonesian government , which remains restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ fish states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Islands Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still is a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to ins@@ ulate the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people want to know more foreign governments to take care of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke out their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua say they are probably not able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sword , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai nation , apart from which it lives under the constant threat of a religious military , is located in arm@@ our up@@ bringing and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , like other Papua New Guinea , said to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ wal@@ ge led a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the Lei@@ che of an Op@@ tic was buried on a territory opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to justice , but at least they have not forgotten their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ turing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers of Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ house , which one calls acci@@ dentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we slept with fire al@@ arms and scre@@ aming of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , &quot; told a inhabit@@ ant who took his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ a civilian authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the buildings cooled .
the government said they work on providing accomod@@ ations for those affected .
the incident may have questions concerning safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior covering for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of the plates of isolation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding could have contributed in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Union ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single was only supported on two sub@@ missions , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ly does not support the required two @-@ third majority .
this is often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional competitors .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to ass@@ ure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work with improving the competitors .
not only for the vote , according to many conflic@@ ting , the proposal has come to deliver the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right next year in the first round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements for training places , etc . , will be reli@@ eved and the players will have to complete their official media events before the Davis Cup .
for more than 1 out of 5 US travelers , prohibited items into aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted among passengers showed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items on the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally banned knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed that they were ir@@ reversible with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey among more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also sure that the younger travelers were more mis@@ chief of the rules .
of those surveyed , that they have attempted to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were intenti@@ onally wed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated that they have carried out objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they would have been deliberately prohibited drugs to the aircraft .
the company said , I asked travelers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware had brought through the airport security and how many things would have been deliberately done .
it is no surprise that people who carry on the most likely sm@@ ug@@ gling - wi@@ s@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
the company , however , indicates that the T@@ SA directives are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ sure what liquids are allowed to take away or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the biggest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items forbidden liquids .
for a period of time , people thought T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does it matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
electric @-@ thou@@ ght@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ min@@ ed that a part of the client has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the triumph@@ ant figures on sales grow and even more gigantic destinations , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k aims for the first time to betra@@ y a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancell@@ ations made during the new mass market model 3 .
during the past months , Mus@@ k frequently applied more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extradition begins .
Mus@@ k has dreamed : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 had already been withdrawn .
critics had always noted that it is merely a binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , Sp@@ illed Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of so far more than twelve percent of all orders could be a problem , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models have been taken - 500,000 being million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,800 reservations per day .
those who order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla creates it , its brand new , never tested in practice tested without any major inter@@ ruption with maximum load .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the in@@ binding of the reservations for Tesla could become a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot hin@@ der customers of satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves forward because of the delay of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained by 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , rejected his previous decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions smo@@ g caused by air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environment authorities against re@@ ac@@ tion@@ ing faster than previous administration .
he did not compl@@ ain the law@@ suit against his previous post in a Federal Appeals Court .
it is a deadline made on 1 October for States to stop the 2015 standard of o@@ zone o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would not hesitate to spend a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid them in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a long time a reliable opponent of demanding environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly declined to block or delay , to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist .
the sudden change from Wednesday is the youngest legal framework for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA car@@ et@@ aker has exceeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to surveillance and reduction of methane le@@ cks .
in a review held on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn around the EPA for cooperation with the states of the EPA for cooperation with the states due to the complex process of the tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; under former administr@@ ations the EPA often has not kept the dead@@ lines for the implementation , and then waited for the execution of activists and others , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation of jurisdiction , and we take fri@@ ght seriously .
we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt urged his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal entities &quot; available to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will push for a comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
in the last month of the appro@@ vals legislative bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not added to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition &apos;s coalition led by the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our Kl@@ agen - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who are poured into their communities . &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight .
the standing smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems with sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ itts surprising course change .
&quot; it is troubled as much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step of the person responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe deeply , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; we have to fight on the ide@@ ological cross@@ bow of the Tr@@ ump government to de@@ fle@@ ct itself on environmental and its special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery @-@ area will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether of its idyl@@ lic location and beautiful view of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ ant from this powerful place .
rescue and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the resort have made friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ gy sm@@ od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ gian @-@ fiction book , &quot; Count Hermann von Sul@@ z . &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the certificate , according to the certificate of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church also belonged to the church , or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the town of Tum@@ lingen , the mountain &quot; of the third , the grand settlements of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 are under@@ lined by the historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was created from the early medieval state @-@ law .
one Lord , who built a church , took part in the church , and remained in the parish of this church , and was also able to inherit it .
this was the right to use a parish church , or as a bishop of a new parish .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger the two bar@@ ges on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was first published in 16@@ 92 , but later he had to be delivered in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were wrapped and the bells were stolen .
the roof was in@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke the pul@@ pit and ch@@ efs cool and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as the final resting place for the dead .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are &quot; no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned into the country .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wo@@ e &quot; has been promp@@ ted by Land@@ lord Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to reduce its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette had no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only exists a wind power concentration zone at the time of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind power for the rest of the city area .
such zones should prevent &quot; de@@ spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier through a change in the area plan , a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided - but it had not approved the District government Düsseldorf , because of a formula .
&quot; by the lack of legal legal requirement , the approval must be modest , according to illegal and therefore , &quot; Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens said , &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , &quot; President of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
current state of things : the city council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government is still standing .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this place the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind power plants is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the relevant writing have been made since the past week of the fourth quarter , &quot; a spokes@@ man explained .
the circle takes them for the occasion to test the matter again .
however , they are likely to carry out that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of ongoing trial at the Administr@@ ative District , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to interven@@ e in the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , which is involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , is closed with the owner of about 65 hectares of large SUV .
with the establishment of the four wind power plants , the electricity consumption of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in Aachen in Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

city and dealer planning &quot; homeland shopping &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ es@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the industrial society and the city administration will take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants for shopping spre@@ e in downtown .
as the chair@@ woman of the Trade Association , Christian King , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will make the customers sensitive to offer the offers of its own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
planned is a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
native companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city center will invite to the &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night shopping &quot; shop .
in doing so , the promotion is not only residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation for advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the active weekend , Christian König .
city administration and industrial society cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the industrial society and the city is entering a further stage of the &quot; Attra@@ ctive Centre . &quot;
these include new offers like the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to Brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest , with all commercial professionals and hosts to move them to the active participation .
there are also attractive offers on Saturday and the deci@@ ding on parking fees that day are part of the concept .
furthermore , customer potential will be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals have lost the city center during shopping .
at the end , all had to help to revi@@ ve the city center - to land@@ lords the factories all over the city and clubs .
it seemed to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y with a network that partially bro@@ minated , King had said in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen , divided into five Thuring@@ ian cities for the first time in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen .
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this Weimar , So@@ ten@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Abi@@ cher@@ ode .
the day should be stronger &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and its significance for the common community of our cities . &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners are also obvious that every citizen can influence its direct environment itself with his purchase .

Tr@@ ump used to pass tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump ordered in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say openly that he would not pay for an planned limit wall .
the US President imp@@ acted him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; That the press cannot say . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an att@@ acking exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , who immig@@ rated to Australia , to take over &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence of the trade that Obama would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford &apos;s massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of viewers in the countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men stepped out to block its way .
the leader of the M@@ obs - a male middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside she@@ ars the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want to see this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ittle of the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one post@@ pon@@ der .
but if a trap for the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all of them are very real sigh@@ s in the audience .
since 2005 , civil law@@ makers come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spots on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State Georgia and a life in civil rights .
for him the re@@ position as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to prosec@@ utions , we want to end , we want to cure , we want to reconc@@ ile , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can &apos;t get into healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
a court of medicine puts a towel upon the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the left for decades , civil law@@ makers say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice granted the black citizens in Georgia to give her voice at the preliminary campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ oned according to the FBI &apos;s black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during one struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore them , didn &apos;t come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ col@@ m from the prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they turn away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b changed the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has prepared the murders and ordered , &quot; includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks does it even more impressive .
&quot; it was a voting rights massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post@@ pon@@ ement of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping and is justified in a sort of profound rac@@ ism , of which many believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confron@@ ted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;t make any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or hear what I did . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of Black - into a room and lau@@ ts , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ placed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chef Cl@@ an@@ ov for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so I , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room was the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the h@@ ester cri@@ es and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , &quot; n &quot; he disappeared from my own property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a er@@ xes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least every black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , always che@@ ered .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; n &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ tering one of the other black actors .
&quot; you must only meet the tough &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely there is the energy in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene once begins .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition is ending violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , kis@@ ses , and then silence .
a woman clothed with a mour@@ ned dress stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and will sm@@ iling Holidays &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears came out of their eyes .
the audience is divided evenly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the street .
you have experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing humidity when Bro@@ oks carries on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels isolated .
when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity to come closer and inspec@@ t the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks at their heads , register the counterfeit blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as if he would remember .
after some minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x rope , and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w is h@@ ug@@ ged Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit that the cl@@ an@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and then breaks up in her arms , and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; one of the women are fle@@ dged .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this out of a reason . &quot;
later , the audience talked to the actors together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta excited about the position with a black pair , which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought words to find words , which feeling the feeling of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you , and that do what you look like , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof holds his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the position is inspir@@ ational in a certain way , because it describes the horror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s like we learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is to be repeated , to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; id@@ ol@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf is on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e directed by gigantic , six @-@ story scenes .
the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) displays an all @-@ off street corner , the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from East @-@ East or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park is par@@ ked to the Rhine , or as a rock band , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
the oil barrel reminds of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ tones - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ mid@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier , in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fic@@ tional Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heavy duty box@@ ers .
brutal the scene , when he proposes Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must also believe in it .
the audience has the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my is a stor@@ my , m@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who formed a humble and the hands on Merkel @-@ smoking .
there is great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows us on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty leisure clothing .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam have been expected to be expected .
in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto for himself , five years later , five years later , in which the moved &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; had been under@@ gone .
hard player Katharina Wagner should have been delighted about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of whose sight has grown .
I draw a positive res@@ ume .
Max Quant@@ works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work in their voluntary year equal to several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in stone furt in the furniture exchange , once in the week , I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in open all day .
how are your experiences so with ?
a lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late voluntary volunteer .
how does this come from ?
lot : I have made high school education .
and then we study a building engineer , let &apos;s say it successfully .
I recognized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I was wonder@@ ing what do you do .
get a social year , there &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social welfare in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual education , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , studying education and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual , during volunteer service several different applications have ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make the FS@@ J .
it is possible to work from aging up to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also part in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , it was the right thing that has mat@@ ted me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not about to calculate statistics .
there are again other people in front of the head , each other and another story behind .
whether a refugee is a person who has been picked up out of the family - you always have to go to it individually .
very interesting .
and they had no contact address ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is a field that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so is that life .

EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns to delay the Smo@@ g Rule after Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled the states that the states are obliged to con@@ strain the smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the step@@ per .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; and said , showing the commitment of the agency , working with states .
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our government partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA announced that the o@@ zone rules should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions to establish where cat@@ ches must be made to keep strict air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental impacts , former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and protection groups that concerns about the effects of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone , contains &quot; the lung function &quot; and ampli@@ fy the respiratory symptoms , &quot; such as asthma .
community wants to have common room
at the end , the decision was clear : the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ S@@ izes the establishment of a common room in the future @-@ future residential complex .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic piece is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reported .
although it is still last until the church &apos;s church is owned by the church &apos;s church , there is no planning of planning for the project by private investors .
there is a discussion concerning a common room .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would be a living area - around 55 square metres - and a ad@@ joining terrace with at least 70 square metres of space for a special price .
in front of the administration and majority of the Municipal Council , such a common room would not be fore@@ seen as meeting only for residents of the living @-@ living housing , but open to the church .
as an example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision , due to the provision of funds for the current budget , has already been decided last autumn , due to con@@ veying options .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be reported to T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision of the decision to sign@@ alize the investor to sign@@ alize him in this regard , no ni@@ p@@ ples between the legs will throw the conclusion that both arti@@ c - which reduces the ambient temperature - which reduces the tear @-@ height and build the construction of economic power - can be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean this addition .
if it helps : unanimously he happens the panel .
not as easy as it is in common room .
Daniela Call points to the many own buildings , with which one is not so up@@ going on , but you can now rest in the common room in the window , says : &quot; I do so hard for it . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y in assets or foreign investors .
unless this is not so , because with the acqu@@ iring of the surface there is no excess , but get a real , within the case of doubt , the counter@@ speech is the counter .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application , orders submitted accordingly , will find three advoc@@ ates .
so it remains with two counter@@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step into our infrastructure . &quot;

in the Hard @-@ Star , hiking
in Har@@ z the nationwide &quot; star path &quot; is meant to be launched .
this plans for the club Ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet way in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; come to the information needs of many hard visitors , named it .
he can repair nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and star images .
in a first phase to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ accessible installations to five to six places &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire come from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tables are to be suppl@@ emented by Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the Star@@ line train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewer learned a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the single stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more enlighten@@ ed than another , although it is much further away .
also , in which constellation can find a selected star , and when he is best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Reserve , the site is part of the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the milk road and even the Andromeda Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university town there has been a planet@@ arium initiative since 2003 . the planet@@ arium is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet way .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet@@ arium will take up to the Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the Plan@@ ets Sed@@ na .
the poles with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf plan down@@ gra@@ ded P@@ lu@@ to at the end point - are exact in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters from the sun .
the total distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
while the light from sun to the P@@ lu@@ to is about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the St@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year .

&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I went up with bronze &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to pay attention to light weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that require the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko then voted .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , Part of a strategy to make Lom@@ ach@@ enko to make a date with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year , in the next summer with Gar@@ cia , who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight tool battle at the Forum on September 23 .

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to Braunschweig that optim@@ ise the optim@@ isation of the def@@ en@@ ction in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal play Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , not the two opponents have been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch in Au@@ e still better , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the dirt chain should also be optimised .
and a gate after a freedom did not want to inv@@ oke any more .
&quot; for the future there will be so , no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also feels better after the experience in preparation with the triple chain better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; if you cannot speak after a monster from a mis@@ leading start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could surely be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the Pok@@ al we will certainly speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
he did not want to know anything .
&quot; the start in the season I first said after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an in@@ clu@@ sion .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home match , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that the player from Au@@ e might even be fresh , since they could not have heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent when they are currently standing , &quot; says the defense of Fort@@ una .
indeed , guests from the Rhineland as an easier favorite on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; that we take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , nak@@ d@@ dy , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance is very positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundesliga , which must be hit by pre @-@ stop , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Music .
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and exagger@@ ated . &quot;
and so I will not experience his players on Sunday at any event .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age evaluation tests
the latest results for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( hard @-@ f@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started with the test of tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum process , after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ational authorities ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) was to be critic@@ ised because of errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees , the under@@ age of age .
until now , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6,@@ 880 has been sent and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency stated that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the person in question is questioned .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant during the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a great difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers has been lied about his age .
in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases to propose that the investigation would be 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person said openly acknowledged that she will be 18 years old in this year .
the method of medical age assessment , with x @-@ ray images of law @-@ teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are analyzed then by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later as usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological ages in this way , is very uncertain .
if we can &apos;t say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low .
the biggest risk is that if the person is scar@@ c@@ ely below 18 , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Department of Stre@@ ets and Transport at the gover@@ ning of Freiburg .
the works at the same time in April began work at all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is scheduled for October and is safe to keep the tim@@ etable .
the first bridge , by Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , which is covered with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge kit .
this is a boundary , which is used as operating road .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge is supposed to be a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge kit .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should be gone .
the particular part is that it is part of finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
a special finger@@ tip feeling the laying of lines through the work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable , where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed of the project by hand@@ ing over the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for bridges between the building farm and the collection from the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is strictly regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher District entrance , the street is in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; tann@@ in &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three bridge profiles amount to 700 000 euros .
financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato sal@@ at
it does not come so often that parties go to a strand , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else could only be difficult under a hat .
the parties represented in the C@@ ret@@ an Vol@@ cano ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peace@@ fully in this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell for a poster &quot; great campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land formed the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are already on site before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ athletes , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ n@@ en@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus just before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; large German potato sal@@ at which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him .
the police officers ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , and it is mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcanoes , he tried to make such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was not a cancellation because of the Laur@@ enti@@ ary kir@@ mes didn &apos;t exist enough parking spaces .
now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is glad that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ place a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ enn@@ ese Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Young .
in the hall , about 200 listen@@ ers are waiting for the fact that the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k are holding their speech@@ es .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour , the Af@@ D event , guests at the front pitch have a longer breath , but also there is scheduled for shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can turn off - no special inci@@ dents .
trombone meets trumpet
a revival with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov he meets a concert among the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ positions in European leaders .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the lust , not just to exceed the boundaries on their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of various gen@@ res .
in this way , Johann Sebastian Bach will be united with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz maker N@@ ils W@@ ry , they mix well as classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall art work .
this part of the program was first performed in spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ anke has written it for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acou@@ stics is deliberately entered into the concert .

after her separation , Kri@@ sten gave that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ der me .
I never liked it , not seriously . &quot;
she particularly suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school time , when she loved like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a Bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , dist@@ illed and ashamed .
now I look back and think myself : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
most of the public they don &apos;t like to love their love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps they call me some as und@@ ank@@ ers but I don &apos;t like to justify me in front of the public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t have the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes re@@ alis@@ es that he has coal em@@ ines in five states , and inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republican National Committee on Thursday took a statement on Thursday night , in which it said , &quot; The Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last ref@@ us@@ al to find a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and not able to find a positive , secret message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation for the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E praises &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ising on Thursday what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russia &apos;s ath@@ le@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight d@@ oping .
he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted in November 2015 after a report of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters .
&quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has identified themselves that they have experienced some fairly hot days , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
CO@@ E said he &apos;s also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for his re @-@ deployment .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think the progress has been achieved , but the Congress does not support the Task Force &apos;s recommendations , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the wi@@ thered system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral player .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia has to carry out some of the criteria for recovery .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden train@@ ee are still free still , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral ceremony for Mali bur@@ sted by soldiers
at a funeral service in the nor@@ theastern Fr@@ itz@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two were thought of a helicopter in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt , under high safety arrangements .
to un@@ clari@@ fied separation , Defense Minister , Ursula and Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two drivers but as &quot; skill of their professional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ ili@@ zer from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their S@@ är@@ ge were arrested and transferred to Germany by a tot@@ en@@ wake of the Bundes@@ wehr to the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the relatives of the Church came to leave the church .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of family , eng@@ agements of friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as the Politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
grape har@@ dens lay ro@@ ses , the relatives resi@@ sted arm in arm in the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; highly decorated , &quot; and full .
the Chief Financial St@@ pt@@ mann had built the flight operation of the attack helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , with one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his Regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ault , commander of the Regim@@ ent , which the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , no one would have been mist@@ aken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen was not dangerous : the use is dangerous .
but he was also of great importance , &quot; for a country by whom we are separated by two states , &quot; she said .
after the funeral party , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are att@@ acking , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to leave the grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already built a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , and he was further informed of the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik be buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a h@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ on@@ ment of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have become king .
in 2016 he retired into retirement , and he also sets the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function that he wanted to see himself against his wife , not as equivalent to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the director of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the past 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French nurse , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the River Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his almost 50 years of age at the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik passed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , critic@@ ised .
my Danish was changing , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sw@@ amps instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ kes instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand social @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for a view .
I was different .
I was happy to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re @-@ dial re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP primarily in Lower Saxony
knowledge Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid new election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
because he spoke to the resolution of the Parliament on Friday .
previously , the surprising exit of a Green M@@ EPs from their land @-@ party in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost their short @-@ votes majority in Parliament to the Opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets created their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) in 2018 .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hannover .
the CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group .
thus , CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Day , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green government must decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , keeps it indispensable for un@@ intenti@@ onally that the Land@@ tag decides to decide on its self @-@ resolution as possible .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday about their further presentation .
the state collection also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister will withdraw trust and cho@@ oses to be a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be fully checked , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; one will discuss all questions when they are legally sensible . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West &apos;s Step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the tr@@ end@@ able MP to return their land entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Gre@@ ens An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west . &quot;
they chose a decision to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even before the background that there was no content differences , we can &apos;t move this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the convic@@ ting of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green M@@ EPs to the CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former Gre@@ ens M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ason in voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook .
it supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag fast .
the Australian T@@ west@@ ens cost Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony &apos;s majority .
in their last erup@@ tion and in their fr@@ ust their personal interests are the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precipitation of the CDU faction government Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members , El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets , with personal career opportunities for the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election .
the CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD , SPD and Green in the country , but a very thin majority of one voice .
agriculture Minister for Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect us from tox@@ ei@@ vers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Federal Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers , to view the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states represent the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , after all we know , a health threat is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the expl@@ orer from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Länder .
nevertheless , my house immediately shut up , and there is a close exchange of Germany &apos;s suff@@ erers in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
trade has just as the manufacturers deal with concern that the sold products are bu@@ li@@ ent and health harmless .
if using eggs , the resi@@ sting content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
after der@@ og@@ iti@@ y knowledge , production plants meets no immediate debt .
rather , they must reck@@ on due to illegal practices of services with economic damage .
as usual , there is too little control in the harvest .
is there only lack of staff , or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls exposed to the process .
for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
this is precisely why a consistent adv@@ ancing of such events and hand@@ over to the public bar in the cases where crimes can be found , of crucial importance .
I have already done several times repeatedly , that I expect from the responsible authorities to recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ile information .
is the regular alarm with food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and efficient food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are dis@@ rup@@ ted .
by the given means , producers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pro@@ il in the post@@ ure of survival is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be rig@@ ged consistently and worked with high @-@ pressure on all levels .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is conscious and g@@ aps .
as the financial rules of the soccer ball to Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ imp@@ aired expend@@ itu@@ res of the European football matches , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not inter@@ fere .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to point out some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without a great loss .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazil from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
PS@@ G can make the money easy to make money , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar , and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs may apply much money for the purchase of players , but have to be able to control with legitim@@ ate revenue sources , which allow them to break the break @-@ even point in its on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their pursu@@ it , effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ ky to recru@@ it when banks or owners have moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P decreased from concentration to the debt of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the crew and build a global mark - to be a harder matter .
during the recent three @-@ year round @-@ ending period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continue to ref@@ resh yourself of excessive expenditure .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a l@@ ump sum , it may distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the ös@@ ger@@ ms for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players in the other ordinary 25 players .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to over@@ look their financial statements by allowing their revenue through companies that are associated with owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could spon@@ ge the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed standard market positions , the UEFA would not apply to a legitim@@ ate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA was blo@@ wn by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar may come on payments from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar , in 2022 , argu@@ ed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM ambassador will easily be able to figure out and find such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is more attentive to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , said the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke below the condition of An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive upon arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars Weg@@ ener by telling the PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financi@@ ally D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars &apos;s official ownership of PS@@ G .
Arsenal manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that is financed by a club .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in the past few years , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y aboard the Swiss has produced choc@@ ol@@ ates for Swiss Life .
now the cooperation in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order to the order .
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ aders Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA published a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will shut down a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked all two to three years and checked in a quality control .
&quot; with the latest supplier of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said spokesperson .
around 17 million small rot@@ ors packed Sch@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ af@@ ules spread to 14 grams a year before landing at the passengers .
at the expense of the cost , Swiss would not want to make any information .
industry insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the order volume according to &quot; North West @-@ schwei@@ z &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : a prestigious order is an prestigious order .
like many applicants on the new invitation , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss .
but in question , only Swiss producers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the treaty beyond spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for a statement .
with chocolate tablets , Swiss has been distributed aboard their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss company completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss has introduced two and a half years with the launch of the cooperation with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long distance routes the customers of the First Class with treats from the conf@@ ection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gl@@ i are spo@@ iled , in the Business Class St@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi von Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .

and there &apos;s another mad plot , in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ ot ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the exercise classes are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who reveals the Matt D@@ os under@@ li@@ pp@@ ard of &quot; singles &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old Kn@@ acker .
there are the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminis@@ cent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ west ring battle @-@ icon@@ ography .
the comedy performed by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka created a found TV series : Romanian Drama of the eigh@@ ties with both polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ heal@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose dialog@@ ues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English will be synchron@@ ized .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice G@@ ags to see the police ( the police spend time when watching chess on TV , such as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda Dr@@ ums - a killer who carries a Reagan @-@ mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
at six long episodes it moves , and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ edited on a smaller length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re could be able to visit his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef will always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who sp@@ ends a he@@ ap of Hamburg .

blow against drug @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for the public prosecutor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday .
during the age of 25 and 77 years , 15 were arrested and already issued warran@@ ts for these arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officers provided greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same Raz@@ cia in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office was determined against organised drug dealers in the southern Germany .
between the public bar in Constance and Palermo there was a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
hence , the large insert on Wednesday morning were also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
there are mainly Italian national nationals combined with regard to Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant in early morning , should go to the band &apos;s account .
fashion compl@@ ains large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; data from citizens who shouldn &apos;t appear &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner register has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany .
that lead to part of serious mis@@ decisions at asylum procedures .
according to the Federal Government &apos;s refugee management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , a media report , according to a media report , has shown attention to large g@@ aps in the extension centre .
short@@ com@@ ings of the data could be registered with asylum procedures and deportation , &quot; in part , in a analysis that lies ahead of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the Register , ten million people are reported by foreign nationals , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be administ@@ rated by about 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained enough , the data quality in parts have not been good far .
in some cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who are far more alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; defective data collected significantly slow down , &quot; says it continues to the report .
in statistics about foreign @-@ out people , the EU citizens should not exceed , which would not have to travel .
but such false assign@@ ments led &quot; to a dis@@ continued debate on the handling of trav@@ ellers , &quot; so it is in the analysis .
meanwhile , the government has apparently begun to return to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they arrived there from there .
this is out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Newspaper . &quot;
according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F will bring such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
following the Dublin Agreement , the EU @-@ State is responsible for refugees first .
when mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country .
for the reasons , the office now write : &quot; meanwhile , the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy I submitted for the admission and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold this comm@@ it@@ ments for sufficient .
other EU states would go back to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin Agreement .
internal political speech in the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten because of the defects in the Italian asylum system human rights conditions and a threat of child &apos;s welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons , the blood don@@ ors offered already for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now made 100 litres of blood , has now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Joint Council urged the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several people , &quot; explained the leaders of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the con@@ serv@@ atives will cr@@ ush their components .
for instance , three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bach reported of the actions that will be held in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; in this year we achieved 114 don@@ ors the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K power supply unit .
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher participant numbers a few years ago .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation would have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; orders will remain , when they maintain interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 , interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in their fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on the household income would continue to continue with inflation in the fall expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and she said that the charges might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide budget funding for banks in order to provide budget funding for banks as expected from the coming February , that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because pressure on the real@@ ation of households will continue to supply the consumption . &quot;
at the rate of interest they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent to expect the markets .
the markets currently projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the bank , however , emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limits . &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ wards forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to those in May .
it has retained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell by these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have ste@@ amed up increasing expectations for an interest rate , and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to rise at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly re@@ covering from the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and low @-@ term salary , since the tigh@@ tening of the tigh@@ tening is even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British quality , which is due to weak pounds , which is a part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes to a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ ic@@ ism .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank , the call for interest rates increased , since inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
the inflation decreased last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to put on back in the coming months .
the Bank said the aims at the rate in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ ume , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response of the s@@ wa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the credit@@ ors want to end strong for businesses and would like to end the year in a positive way .
the market is especially good for those in which the existing De@@ als are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should rub controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV @-@ pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that prior to the intercourse occupancy phy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk provision@@ ing by around 86 percent , now the health service is delivered by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in the past year , according to the N@@ HS , in spite of the alleg@@ ation to pay the local authorities to finance him .
the chess set announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first one who will enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ dispos@@ ition phy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces HIV transmission with infectious diseases .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications in the body are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the question are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully .
clinics are identified suitable for participants that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are living in England and registered at a resident , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical analysis , how it is targeted and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take them .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of persistent progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , when targeted and vulnerable people are targeted , the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is actually individually controlled and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner is subject to the improvement of many , many lives .
we really welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to be out that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , Sha@@ dows health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ ism process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence shows how transformed this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
it is important that this study is so fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their pockets and sold .
&quot; I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
I &apos;ve been in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first time , the 1,000 square foot has been over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed completely .
originally a one @-@ room property with a sc@@ anned layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to make the spacious ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked together , without leaving us to g@@ aps .
it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that he had the right height at the top or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down via the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of s@@ ke@@ wers plays a role while adding theatre , room and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him longer .
in the kitchen , refle@@ ctions feel like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units for all the triangles and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel ampli@@ fiers , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; it is reci@@ pro@@ cal so it is when you push out the door , very easily . &quot;
thanks to cle@@ ver@@ able use of room and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high quality materials , which pro@@ cure the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are things which you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a apartment can be turned through good design and increased square met@@ er@@ count of somewhat standard in something quite aston@@ ishment .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollars property rights
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate in Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton football club &quot; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business activity shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her de@@ ceased father Colin - from Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul is about one third .
a judicial authorities say that Colin property has a value of $ 316 million and a value of $ 176 million in value of $ 176 million .
the distribution of property and cash has been proved for Paul as a pro@@ ving point .
&quot; the statements of Colin proposed victims have left him with the left what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it .
the first hearing of the Supreme Court ruling took place on Friday last Friday .
the brothers also fight for control over the existing business - where Colin claimed that Paul claimed to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some owners in@@ competent .
in an early affair that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage shows that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the Bar Association .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her clo@@ ister husband Luigi was Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950 @-@ 80s and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood song , in Colin the first je@@ ans@@ ke of the family opened .
Colin says that he started West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their inheritance to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group group , with Colin claims that Mark were paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million .
both Luke and Mark are as well as Mark , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept himself very well , even though he was a former AF@@ L executive board and after a biography one year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have attempted and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it actually .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first day of working with conducting employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House to repair it : bad news that got into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good news . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have attempted to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitor its media services .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television goes back to decades - and now where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if the candidate was off@@ ended because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February to POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it consists of control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter are ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps this campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets could have not included even more spark plugs .
we will probably never learn about the twe@@ ets that the tr@@ ump has not sent .
when his staff had made it a few times , trouble from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump contro@@ versy .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House consists of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by making tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , pre@@ sidents of strategic reasons doub@@ tful information .
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tram@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is how a volcano can react to negative press lines , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out what these origin@@ ate from .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone accused the President of evil disp@@ le@@ ased a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter or that he has no specific evidence , or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and ref@@ uses them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document@@ ate the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to prove the most effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still searching for influence .
this un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Master of selected crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the people will pray and hoped for the population .
the police sent over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the requested heavy crimin@@ als are not known , they are hoping for evidence of the population and to pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; adv@@ ent calendar from the winter .
the experiences have shown that many vol@@ atile holiday destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , it has been the www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ al website , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of those who have been arrested until now have been arrested , at least eleven of them after the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over one dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers at the foot of war , which have negotiated a dit@@ ch from the municipality in order to demand a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transporting them after they were cancelled only in May , without being deported from the bur@@ ial of bur@@ ial dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense system and pushed their vehicles through a section called un@@ impe@@ ded to find a road .
angry residents have pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it would be &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent away by Bentley Heath , where they have thrown stones on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must act through shame on the implementation , since he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , have been moved and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to push for long sub@@ missions to protect their parks .
I live without the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay attention to my community if the Council cannot stop this . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of these trav@@ ellers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have increased this time and even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
speaking in the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible .
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many local residents report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior when they call 101 by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we propose our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stein is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
that &apos;s good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the time of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the then ambi@@ ance of the company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year was lost and also revenues generated by the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the estate and as a collective accommodation , which was provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ cont@@ ested at the time of the Municipal Council .
but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stein &apos;s Mayor , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the site , and he already spoke of serious interested parties to the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ancements with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Manor al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , there has been a long time construction container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were torn apart , ceilings to part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire property building is a single construction site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance area is surrounded , new windows are fitted .
everything was later called &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a lot of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
we would not move to the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ Bath , but already on a up@@ scale city level , emphas@@ izes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms to spread broad , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual trav@@ ellers , groups or business@@ men are supposed to feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants not to set up exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outer plants are also brought to front , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace that is open from the restaurant , the public will be accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic about : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Aff@@ air : us special Jury sets the Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair to US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is expected to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the panel recorded work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under vocation with the cause confi@@ ded .
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ caster CNN reported that there is already first inci@@ dents of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was a conversation between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to stand in campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
a few weeks ago , the Washington Post published a few weeks ago that the Special Representative Tr@@ ump personally picked up the center and examined the accus@@ ation , whether the president may impe@@ ded the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to prove and decide to check and decide whether the charges should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called count .
usually it is switched on , if it is greater and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons on awareness among E@@ id .
according to the transmitter , CNN has already been issued un@@ loading , turning around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in meetings were asked to be a statement called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ hner and his dam@@ aging campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ continue along with the conversation .
right experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the objec@@ tion show that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should be needed quickly .
however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the interpretation of a new phase in research and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump , is the beginning of a new phase .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations took the President on Thursday night a speech in West Virginia to depic@@ t Russia &apos;s affair as campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he knows nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but this also usually work in obe@@ dience , he stressed .
the White House provides all measures aimed at ex@@ ped@@ ited the work of the special agent on &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not to be determined against the President .
you have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ra@@ ins there were accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump , he would hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump made him an attitude of investigations against the then national security adviser , Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special @-@ medi@@ ator and its employees .
the spec@@ ulation solved them whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent special newspaper of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later president Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators were submitted to the legisl@@ ature on Thursday , after which the special educ@@ ators could no longer be released .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
in the Western Arctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has been replaced by the scar@@ f at the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this distributed the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
the more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large colon@@ el is driven to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ic@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
in what extent the climate change played a role in the crash of the ice@@ berg , according to research data is un@@ clear .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual con@@ jun@@ ctions in the region for some 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ simile background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ban@@ s so far .
sm@@ el@@ ly flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is located south of South America almost on the top of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic peninsula .
North of this shooting was the equilibrium of wa@@ xing , and dis@@ rup@@ ted a few years ago .
a complete scar@@ f was crushed there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot of evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ bow was in danger , as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as that .
in addition , the ice plate standing under tension and could be broken down , if a piece set off at a key place .
the melt of gravel and ice@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and dri@@ pping so much water as it makes it to melt .
however , the loss of the gun leads the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea , and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small measurements , the British research project writes the observation of Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ n is the fourth biggest scar@@ f of Antarc@@ tica according to A@@ WI @-@ S@@ ands with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the mainland from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural thing and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most important retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists were cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ lipse can now grow again or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this trend will last decades .
even if this researcher did not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg to climate change , so in the past decades the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has fallen very many of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
this long skir@@ t of Antarc@@ tica extends South America .
according to data from the research program British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature increases .
Antarc@@ tic peninsula has passed around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ ame them in the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants pets in the staff
because it will always be more difficult to occupy freely , the CDU out of the employers to become more attractive .
just shortly before the summer break , the C@@ day 41 new positions in administration has begun .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the management administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have their first working day after their first working day .
the lec@@ turers in the circle are obviously very des@@ i@@ fic@@ ated .
there were approximately 620 applications to be visited in this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lack of staff to handle the increased requirements and tasks .
at present there is a circle of M@@ ett@@ mann as far as 50 un@@ occupied places .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CDU would now have to join the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG insi@@ sts in the administration .
according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for recru@@ iting and staff development are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to un@@ cover just short periods of skilled workers , but to meet forward @-@ orient@@ ations of the candidate &apos;s short@@ age .
the overall concept should be oriented toward the inside and outside , to show concrete action for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personal problems we did not know earlier .
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
this comes to a high number of employees working in the service or age caused by the service .
thus , the highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU , continues with his party even beyond the common application .
he has long already looked into the chal@@ k for a f@@ ou@@ th@@ ed surprise when he publicly exhibited the recruitment of personnel and the remaining parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal workers association .
&quot; if we do not come up to a satisfactory solution here , the county administration should also go with the trade unions - maybe in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a building rate . &quot;
thus , the CDU , the employees and officials tried to pay better when the rates for the public service actually sees .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you move into a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have always grown more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ lord Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sh@@ ag@@ grav@@ ated the tone for NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ ett@@ ings
Italy has warned NGOs who use life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new conduct of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ager &apos; because their crew effectively worked together with human hands in a way that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which is in operation only since one year , rejected the Italian state @-@ wal@@ ts Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media .
&quot; we can see all the exc@@ uses that are currently collected , only after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ amed &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , supervised since October .
it is thought that his crew members will be delivered on board , which can be delivered directly from men &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the dict@@ ator of the state @-@ forest , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of investigating the authority of Italian coast guards , who monitors the ambul@@ ances in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not out of any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of conduct , boats must have monitored boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , especially an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to keep himself to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , because they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; to their life@@ actions .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize @-@ winner doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy had strongly declined in the past weeks , which insi@@ sted that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and carried the cooperation with the local civil servants .
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe .
increase and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ ers bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the northern pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ bun@@ als and land@@ marks .
three friends were available for this .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour started on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
they followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
there was always a longer climb for the long time for the long time .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and for the People &apos;s fest Wur@@ m@@ markt .
again the look@@ out point moves to look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate Ascen@@ sion .
on the last two days , there were again many altitude meter .
ca@@ vern@@ s , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and cottages brought will@@ s breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers located in the free@@ wheel centre of healing br@@ ine .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest from its best site - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga for e @-@ sport
sit the Sport Stars in the future , instead of computer consol@@ es , rather than fighting through wind and weather on the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ ras@@ en ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been to a serious industry to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high rings .
this also recognized the first federal lig@@ aver@@ aver@@ aging in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Managing Director Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
it is sure that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the coming weekend , FIFA World Championships FIFA at London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers compete in different clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen are now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football player .
&quot; real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all the markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ ers under contract , one could be present online more often on these markets than just once in the year , to send the federal government to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the football @-@ simulation FIFA at competitive edge .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ es have long been established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with the rest of Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly acc@@ ust@@ omed .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y also dealt with the question long with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that one can find even in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress transactions , hormon@@ al changes .
furthermore , cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response rate .
professional gam@@ ers shouldn &apos;t just exercise on the console but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the best player is a good player . &quot;
however , F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a subject . &quot;
controls are difficult in online gaming , and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports .
scientists emphas@@ izes the high @-@ inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are travelling internationally , which is like a great global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by management consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , there were 50 million euros in Germany , mainly regarding advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , sales will be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ i@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is taking part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .

only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and to clari@@ fy the old times , is no longer enough .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time to al@@ ign the company at the same time .

Michelle Carter , because of the texts that Conrad Roy ready to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to currency .
Carter was convicted in June due to his neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy spoke on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is no comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the vocation .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both they had had a mental illness as well as Mr Roy .
in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State lawyer .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility taken , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that it is completely un@@ fortunate . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he didn &apos;t find out that her &quot; Age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even her spirit disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a public prosecutor , a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is no day that I didn &apos;t give the loss of my beloved Son .
I want it to be proud of me , and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it therein .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , told her that she would never be pursued by the realization &quot; that she will never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to set a just@@ ification of preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime that calls for others to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case referred to national attention after Car@@ ters Text@@ maker revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging up , spring from a building , walk yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that had sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; Everything that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the case .
the legal opinion has shared .
to the few , Carter defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 , was sentenced to death in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not imprisoned . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich allowed the Audi Cup as a captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern mar@@ ries the Con@@ stant Cup winner a great season to - Extra motivation does not harm .
something else was in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra piece was very small , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New had to be seen , he made his close ties to the arm .
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t have announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner told her first deployment of the Bavaria @-@ Captain after his first deployment .
good , the one could have better run than at the 0 : 2 vs SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also suggest K@@ imm@@ ich .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the vacation professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f has been chosen as a player leader , but he .
sugar spread to those who want to give a lot to those who want to keep in charge .
if you are looking out , the heritage of Lah@@ m &apos;s inheritance can only be seen , a small extra motivation can only be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ ashed on the field on Wednesday .
right behind , this is his position , the white bin@@ ds on the arm did the rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this start@@ up like the one who can take the rowing at the best .
he gave instructions , tried to control the trou@@ pe trou@@ pe trou@@ pe .
he had the look at all , while many others were busy with themselves .
V@@ idal therefore , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ks hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches do so on the devil come out onto the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ks also only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not neg@@ atively .
that was all very good .
Sü@@ le ran along beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ ated effort@@ lessly .
the nam@@ es@@ hly decorated Nap@@ oli was very difficult , and also Sü@@ le also tried to play a few times in the play @-@ building .
his colleague Rud@@ y also stated that the result was &quot; not so how we hoped it hopes . &quot;
but also he showed an ordinary achievement during their debut .
game changes , temp@@ o change : &quot; I was brought to this style . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria world is still looking for the new entry , one saw in the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ un@@ ky statements on his back his new player .
there he listened to an interesting proposition : &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed .
in Bavaria , you just have to win each game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach this new anymore .

company content with Rheinland @-@ pf@@ enn@@ ese ministers : Economics praises Wis@@ sings pace
it often seemed un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year , in which the new business minister Volker Wis@@ dom ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak to T @-@ V request from a change in economic policy - and ad@@ mits simultaneously the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; knowledge attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the circuit diagram of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands now in the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry for a planning procedure , until 2021 shall be the building law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west @-@ circum@@ navigation of Trier , which stands in the int@@ ru@@ sive requirement of the federal traffic schedule .
the aim is to take off the route in December 2020 in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann , says Minister of Commerce in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) , Trier , is excited by the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ dom is an open ear for people who want to establish an own company , the I@@ HK .
Trier &apos;s Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ entive for young apprenti@@ ces , managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the main master examination and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within 10 years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
near the planned road construction be quick facts , at the same time there are the necessary staff at the same time , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , principal managing director of the I@@ HK Trier .
the 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the knowledge of the state company mobility have been occupied until now 29 jobs .
the I@@ HK requires , to give more orders to external offices .
CDU faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to the calculations of the Court , investing in 2017 and 2018 over 20 million euros less in the purchase of national roads as suggested .
Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the lack of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band construction in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ pol@@ l with a note of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still standing by the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already cleared the field after four months .
Audi is expected to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are confron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction .
a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said the company is the opinion that &quot; there is more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thereby referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles can offer or limit diesel vehicles .
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described entrepreneurs as retro@@ spec@@ ts .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , installations for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles designed to install exhaust gases , also take what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to ignore the powerful auto companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , that could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ old devices that regulate emissions to comply with the regulations if a car was tested but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics department was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be made in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have deployed a system to handle the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
Audi &apos;s involvement in the study could be elu@@ sive : the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportional to win by Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ards and the laughter against the sorrow
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was part of the most published cartoon animation , the buttons of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working and working on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; because there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he joined himself as a drawing for gambling cards - which was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again the artist inspired himself to be inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures are moving in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he also sits on the drawing , still working for almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches will continue to spread much spreading worldwide .
since six years he has been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ alli@@ on most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thou@@ sand@@ ing ler as a counter@@ player .
for the first time his figures in the 3D film , which is to come to the chin @-@ up wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
this is why he is rather rel@@ ying on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced .
lavender from Provence on climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lavender is inev@@ itable due to the conditions of d@@ rought conditions and because of the diseases transmitted insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research initiative , CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in spring and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the life of lavender .
there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and there are very many of them in dry weather . &quot;
and it stands much on the game .
lavender oil does not only pay for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of very long plant pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a sha@@ king mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employee of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce meet usually on Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ r@@ ale , ally .
you ask the rep@@ orters , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal muscles .
there are drug ad@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being suspected of the administration list or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that are dangerous to the chaos of Mexico .
there is no ru@@ st@@ int of violence , and while in all the country the bodies are common , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto opened its position in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 has been led to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now , there were at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ ator by Ri@@ o@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
his lack of absence becomes deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hung on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thirty years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discussing their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ epl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although it was built in 2010 by the General Prosecutor of the Con@@ federation , it was directed to only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee to the Protection of journalists .
as with most thousands of murders , each year associated with drug trade and organic crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers are rarely put on trial .
with Ri@@ o@@ ce they still have to deal with the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are un@@ paved and even though the terrain is still av@@ our@@ able .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security concerns little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we susp@@ icious all . &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he was able to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the 12th River .
the shooter was driving away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested in the past year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of land , as rival fac@@ tions here fight to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t mean that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey maus@@ ole@@ een for drug ad@@ resses that are greater than many homes for the living .
forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
initially , in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ ons in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have off@@ ended the sons , the Gang@@ es purchased each copy of the output , as soon as she was delivered to newspaper c@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the arrest of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined with five colleagues from the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without losing the anti@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
with the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest coverage , and the turnover and advertising took place .
reporter loved it , hard tre@@ ading examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by an publication that they could read stories that nobody else did to deal with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drugs history , where they always led them .
he gave up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you must take up the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who , like a harbour worker , could curse the boy@@ friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he always would carry his hat .
he always would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go there always at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also has forced to ask her own involvement in question , how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ sur and self @-@ maintenance .
trust his own inst@@ ants .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier is happening . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - exactly as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other States , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ding , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for security training , no cell phones were allowed . days previously announced that sp@@ y@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
two polic@@ emen sought protection from heat from 104 degrees Celsius ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices from Ri@@ o@@ ce in a small @-@ class quarters of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in joke , some of the rep@@ orters , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who described the governor himself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months , since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug ad@@ mits are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce left three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former mag@@ ician Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to state spending , focusing on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally owned by drug dealers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Political Party ( pr@@ i ) , who ruled all political levels almost the whole century .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ cali@@ ber cases .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers have watched the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body .
&quot; all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
the Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ icker , dedicated to the murders of journalists , because the employees had become something that they would never have expected : activists in the name of the press .
replica Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the morning due to another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists had become stronger in the whole country by sending them in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on obe@@ dience and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists and kill them because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that she is again divided from the government , because she is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez was repeatedly said that journalists gathered in Mexico by organizing crime , concerned government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug ad@@ mits but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who were inter@@ ned with the organised crime under a ceiling .
in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has identified more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you live because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the murders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
no one gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ set were next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others do on how it did El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
2010 was the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez public to the drug box with a Editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and still observe the streets and looking for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as apparently by the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who keep back and continue to work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that the drug dealers are troubled at him .
&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and therefore I became rep@@ orters , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement before the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to sum@@ s .
a number of sh@@ ot@@ ters with band@@ ages and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ bst@@ ones they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens r@@ ul@@ ls nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , the guard stopped to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the gre@@ ener of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when Javier was assassin@@ ated on the same day , the practition@@ er asked me to send them on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to ex@@ ert his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , even a sc@@ ary .
now researchers found out that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that it was able to realize that his gloves were of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the preserved pan@@ de@@ ed Din@@ osau@@ rs who ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ grown state has researchers that describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; bl@@ oss@@ oms
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the vegetable plant her@@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Funk , on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that appeared from the surrounding rock , and decided to look closer .
the fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has been sleeping , &quot; said the principal author Caleb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to see .
&quot; it will enter into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found that this plant her@@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a walk @-@ like tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique used as counter@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better in its surroundings and so@@ aking his enemies , experts , what it suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creation from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and now is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now have studied wild animal and studied Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of specimen enabled us to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the con@@ vey@@ ors , a widespread defence method in animal , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its base .
although the ter@@ ti@@ ces is common , the results are surprisingly , since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds by far the living animals survi@@ ves .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution of the con@@ frontation was taken as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , which apply the con@@ vey@@ ors - think of deer , Zeb@@ ras or gir@@ d@@ ules - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a true struggle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strongly ge@@ ared Din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ m@@ ules of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous have to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r bay rot@@ ates .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his final Dar@@ min@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , into a river and driven into the sea , where he sun@@ k on the back to the sea floor .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with contra@@ ctual skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal maintains , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construc@@ ting it . if you are only a little with the eyes of Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that it is in sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge therm@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , through the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was hun@@ ted by the pan@@ de@@ ed Din@@ osau@@ rs of some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology journal , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in the mud .
the creation was found by Shawn Funk , when he was found on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the preserved pan@@ de@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters long ) and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the shred@@ ded plant @-@ e@@ aters was sw@@ amped by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater fishing of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the rem@@ nants of this particular specimen are so good that the Hau@@ tre@@ k still cover hol@@ ed tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is as rare as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more I desp@@ ise it .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ den @-@ cut tank plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on its side , his five fingers spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age to A8 : lots of injured
a great accident on Thursday night at the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , on the late morning of Thursday afternoon , about 20 people have been injured .
according to the first data of the police , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were just under 30 vehicles , including trucks , sometimes trucks .
about the exact number of injuries were initially no information before .
it was about light to moderate injuries , a polic@@ eman said .
a big tribute to rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in driving Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long return was formed .
as a AZ reporter reported , it was also on the counter @-@ way to massive Dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ fighters not@@ ated the trademarks of the vehicle @-@ len@@ ders , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 I took a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ orters and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ er helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes up an unclean , or takes the driving place in the middle of the workflow .
driving card control .
but the times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently exam@@ ining the create driving card control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone , taken at its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
at present , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , wide we come from .
it is expected to be available at many other remote locations in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the rail ticket rank@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it also has to be purchased on the app by rail , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and finally , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one clim@@ bs into the train , calling out his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
with the test clients , a button to the electronic de@@ valuation will be published .
the train@@ ers get a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat field Y .
when the driver check@@ box comes in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already @-@ off @-@ off ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying staff , check in the DB Navigator just yourself .
this enables the passengers to make their travel time in the move of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB remote traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs . &quot;
who often rides there , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains the ticket checks are among the biggest off@@ ences .
for often , in any case , one of the passengers don &apos;t have all documents that you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document , which one must indicate .
the episode are endless discussions between mig@@ rat@@ ory and driving pleasure , which leads to a bad mood in the audit@@ or or large space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end that takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional access numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her heart .
just one day after it arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll by Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled over a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police has just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; it was there .
confused as nobody else had posted information on their feedback , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed for their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , a un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of bro@@ och le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thinking Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she made her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later on the evening .
there were photos from the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a rebellious dog .
in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman asked his rif@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... all of you kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not custom@@ ary , &quot; and Fer@@ rell remembered her statement .
&quot; this is not the type of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can call it . &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return trip and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell passed away with her daughter who drove a flower dress and a crown crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remembered how I taught you when black people have to fight for those who believe in ? &quot; she remembered what she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a cli@@ max of its ... what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see it and be mounted in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience in which they do not experience any kind of rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women child .
I feel that I would prove a bad service to keep them far off . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was transferred to a camping area than the activists on the possible non @-@ charges of Offic@@ ers Wilson .
Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass by demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of acti@@ vism began to accept Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vism changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association and focused on food @-@ righteousness and health ine@@ qualities in black churches .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted to be &quot; documented , &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell &apos;s sense : &quot; are you documented or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from the White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices have not cent@@ ered , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his acti@@ vism around death .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brows@@ ing .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; this was the main thing for me how these people will be represented , because I will be presented . &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rell@@ s experience - to show that it is in motion &quot; not a Messiah guide , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
consequently , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rell@@ s life as they love and marry her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rell@@ s &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , based on the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identified as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is no more &quot; m@@ ative type of action &quot; in which Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ cked this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it is no coincidence although she was in front of the front , because there is a life on these cru@@ ises than a black , gay woman so much in the game .
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue to stand .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere in the area called her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she mour@@ ns to a voice and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support them .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; : TV readers discuss on bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the South of the pedestrian zone sp@@ ends the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
the theme hardly leaves the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi &#93; ) or quite simply : &quot; magn@@ itude ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build on that a gallery attract more customers in the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farm market stands , in which 13 direct marketing their products .
the construction work will conclude with the start of the construction .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and there is no way to sit down outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake in the land women are very happy again .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there are also .
especially the small mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery has come to the amount of rent .
the new project is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping m@@ ns in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ p@@ ments or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since it is not even a regular weekly market , it is more important to us that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer , and is absolutely cheap .
as you can see , shop stores in a shopping mall can only be rented from larger firms , because the char@@ ds are often not portable for reta@@ iler .
too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and that , which is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fit for me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmer &apos;s market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it run the g@@ hosts bit gallery before , all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just doesn &apos;t work .
and shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peas@@ ant market place , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market , thank you very much - as I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ measur@@ ably equal - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and hair@@ cut , which were sent to her from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st used a 35 @-@ year sentence after having publicly made diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , their discipline in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman , and ground@@ breaking Dis@@ sid@@ y , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look from Mann@@ ing and could not only look like a intellectual comment on the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many wise men , as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Bradley Edward , but already spoke openly about the identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age Act , computer and theft .
by the prison it was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is confident of an driver seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde wi@@ pe - with whom it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ akes and che@@ wing gum , extracted by the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which people could look like .
this was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took care of Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were led to the letters of letters , who had several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ orted Images &quot; from Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who would like to convert a future in which the President Chel@@ u would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ ke , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ ez@@ able way to remedy the rigid divisions he would actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , the artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) is an end of the &quot; automatic sm@@ ashing , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
the opposite wall is their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ al of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped that the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) show how surprising , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , like her with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States , like King Kong .
&quot; when they put your speech in cold , they have won it , &quot; says it .
&quot; so don &apos;t wait your mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who greet them from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still get fully looking , when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they are supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks , of its own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ators , which co@@ ves like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
this was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , who were written with the genetic h@@ ap@@ orts with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had sent them to the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said from the portraits .
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot;
University of North@@ western and an employee at the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway to a professor at North@@ western University and one employee at the University of Oxford , who had been searched for susp@@ ects , after a man had been caught in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acquisition of the National Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several bul@@ lets .
a warning system published by the Chicago Committee of Chicago published a warning system that the bodies had been discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the event of the event for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the bul@@ lets as murder while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects .
L@@ ath@@ em has been associate professor for micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. cub@@ bage , vice president of the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been in secret now and ruled by the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter being studied by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates at this examination , &quot; said Cub@@ ism .
War@@ ren is senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help us to help us with the US investigation . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens were sho@@ cked and want to set up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Department of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to put the authorities .
&quot; the police have a presentation of their residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police got a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip that had happened in the apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el@@ ly .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the op@@ tics and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in near future &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage to comply with the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; Mut@@ ko declared on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA for compliance with code , which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and published recently on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything concerning Russia &apos;s occasion .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria stated in the list of criteria , however , states that the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the results of the WA@@ DA approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we perform the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has collapsed an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit that what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os spoke with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales department R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody wanted to accept this report due to this report , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA as part of the D@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
it has been allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Olivier Niger declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved into the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there have never been consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at the growing company to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement , it enables companies to offer surveys , surveys and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company which shows most complaints and which managers have low state results - so you can re@@ boot , why .
companies are coming to see that at the head of the workplace culture , so that you have not been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , who has released a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have spoken .
for launch @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth of 2020 according to the financial technical web site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recogni@@ zing , seen an increasing interest and activity in the middle of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Enterprise can send customized &quot; pul@@ s- &quot; p@@ olls , confi@@ dential answers in real time and watch the warmth cards of your problem .
there is also an anonymous SMS hotline which can report a bad behaviour with the employee .
and if the principal leader is involved , we go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that his collabor@@ ator is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ ethical , there may experience precious consequences by consumers boyc@@ ott , workers of workers and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she will find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ breeding and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said that there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent is involved , problems that were station@@ ed in offices in cities or states , can be hidden in offices in cities or states - as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lu@@ c@@ ely practition@@ er - are identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we are protecting our shareholders &apos; legal disp@@ utes . &quot;
company started to take ethics , values , and employee involvement in 2002 , after having collapsed the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen because of ethical violations of the Enron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said .
but it lasted until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you were not able to prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and the companies are based on recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supports both start @-@ ups .
convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the entire capital to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and carried out its entire financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than ever .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only w@@ agers .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience , said : &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience . &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools promise third party , commitment and use of employees , it is not a miracle that you find support .
the data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of an enterprise does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees to your feedback , there can be an expect@@ ation that the change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees cannot motiv@@ ate .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to have left the collection of collecting data .
&quot; because if you do not follow employees , &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ?
do you care about that ?
and who doesn &apos;t care about that , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now running monthly surveys now , was able to transfer action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to implement the speed of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , able to organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
on Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights into staff , and it hopes that on long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose human , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose company .
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football player on one side of the new exercise fields of the teams on the campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ cot and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final tests before they return at 6 : 30 am to the water Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
for this reason , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will start to meet the players ready @-@ packed .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood was moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to stop doing 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change of the N@@ CAA , even if they add a further point of routes of the player .
&quot; we put these enormous burden for three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they are just pressed , they followed , they are great people .
I think we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it is really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its intern@@ ship as soon as the camp is finished , what is due to clear views of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that was already covered with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a door fo@@ ils , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people rent a room there and then set up there to record a exercise .
if you have the video from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I am doing so very worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit reports by third parties and their results below the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible counterfeit messages and send them to fac@@ simile checks from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they also have influenced the 2016 presidential elections .
the problem is also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters should be flooded in May with false stories , and Germany are supposed to be punished by the social media networks if they do not succeed to eliminate h@@ ass@@ fulfilled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of new facts .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , what stories of fac@@ tions are dealt with third parties , people want to make more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature in the &quot; linked articles &quot; and to other changes on his messages feed to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze film video and was for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ 1980 a si@@ p@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now to inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ r@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ h@@ ed .
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; stretches over time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ print !
and they still smell as smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as if he himself did .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so acting with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and nearly four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : &quot; I have given my welcome ven@@ ding a little bit &quot; ) seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and have spent many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ograph@@ s had spent many centuries in the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land bra@@ ids , gar@@ dening and sometimes with the artists that worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats told &quot; Oh that it described it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what had said : &quot; one might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to put on a wider base in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who is leaving the newly built castle to join the peas@@ ant rise of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar who appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ ant began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , who hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell , portra@@ yed his own funeral , filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be right to be able to make debt and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ males en@@ sol@@ es their debt crises , giving rich women to marry - I imagine it as a he@@ ap well looking guys before , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of its deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ b experiences
he has got a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been demanded by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the digest@@ ed life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mary chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started to launch its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team would like to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and his slogan .
at the end of August , there should be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel yesterday .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
in essence , we are the firm conviction that we know as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen around the beauty and attraction of our city very well . &quot;
in action , it is more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promises , one that gives the city a unique sole feature . &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium five @-@ digit amount makes the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost its new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) were advis@@ able for retirement and promotions in the Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ scope .
so also this week .
on first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no longer in the building of general Staff , as previously , but in the office of Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice Premier@@ s , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
this was the number of civilians in the Y@@ as in the number .
the Government draws the bree@@ ders on the military .
chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed Cou@@ p , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ duc@@ ts .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen who sees Erdo@@ gan as wire @-@ wire of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people , who have been involved in the attempt at the coup attempt , will have been negotiated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was referred to as &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really affect the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general Staff , there is concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , who manifested among others in raising the head@@ tu@@ ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the grand@@ parents in the army and security forces continue to continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 government officials , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als are formerly known as the real masters of the country .
th@@ rice they took under appeal on their role as the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan left the power of the military step by step , not least of calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted towards an Islam@@ ization of armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ known officer , who , after the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad , sought for asylum in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this is true , NATO could not leave Nato &apos;s evolution .
anyway , there are doubts in the alliance according to the ac@@ adem@@ ics of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US entry plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
it looks ahead to lower the legal immigrants of 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for issu@@ ing visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two Cham@@ bers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that come to our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ itation track for race transportation
again over the past few months over the future of the race vehicles has been fought - now it should go fast .
even before the end of the year the circuit is to be built , on which the tourist bahn will be built .
in order to secure the future of the race of the competition , according to the Ministry of Transport , we will start construction work on the route .
&quot; with the decision to further order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is especially important for the tourism important link , &quot; declared Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the distance he applied to approximately 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the land will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of land , will currently be coordinated , declared S@@ ühl .
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators are already in the technical details about the technical details .
&quot; so the tim@@ etable is based on vehicles and quality standards , &quot; S@@ ühl said .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this makes the race end shuttle to be regular on December 2017 .
the rac@@ ite shuttle is especially popular with tourists popular train connections between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past months , the course of a pilot project was tested according to whether the distance of sufficient many people is used to order it again in the future .
the circuit is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex @-@ robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that 2017 cannot be more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex @-@ robot .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the company deliver a lot of it , and we will see it much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ orters have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon ing@@ ival that feels warm , with consci@@ ously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt its robot to his beliefs &quot; and select everything , from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his finger@@ nails .
but there is still more wor@@ r@@ ying because many robots possess the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look like a st@@ eppe @-@ woman progressive .
modern S@@ exports have developed into robots using a silicon ing@@ ival .
the real Bot@@ ix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties , which it will be appealing , for example , rel@@ ap@@ ses .
and then there &apos;s still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ap@@ acy and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion .
that &apos;s what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
it can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ sist@@ ent female properties that goes on rape if you go one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is worried about most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex toys .
her orig@@ ination and its increasing refin@@ ement show a little dar@@ ker and low in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional allowance .
most men of course do not think of course no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their rising popularity , they still remain in the fr@@ inge of consumption culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ ened out of the boundary zones , in regards to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until they are the free market for these .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a period in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there has been a president in the White House , who has ch@@ oked up women sexually attacked .
the horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos;s &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the swallowed body and the out@@ dated eyes , but how realistic this vision appears .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the aim of this Sex @-@ Robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their inheritance would like to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , robots are no real women .
they can &apos;t separate or go away from their companion .
they have no placement or a background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything , which might inter@@ fere with the imagination .
otherwise stated : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in terms of 2017 : maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human rights
it has become a binary of the tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political divisions , which have polarized the US elec@@ torate , have also divided families in small size .
around Christmas and harvest festival there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of cad@@ enza .
we were all supposed to burst all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power tr@@ um@@ ps , families together .
I consider this because my cousin , a left @-@ oriented poet that lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family that visited New York this week .
she remin@@ ded me that the unit can have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows whom she knows , including the Republican @-@ transformation , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks with themselves .
the left hand was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the final effect of his presidency has power to push us all right .
if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that his M@@ itt@@ ens won &apos;t stop any more day .
however , there is still a long @-@ time long @-@ time scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of confusion .
I find myself today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked out ) - both in fact occur as a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritual health to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ el of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass @-@ designs on the central cylinders - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ushing and the animals turn to look full of fear on their own shoulders - extremely dark and the c@@ lim@@ iting music gives it a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és and a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings will become old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not just meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and all have a great time .
if I had to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but practice pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was alien@@ ating , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with breast pain in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ ul@@ led to his hand@@ lers , which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first dead body because of murder after a appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ enk@@ ins in the early morning of the year 2013 by pushing them by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to put this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , it was too dense .
the National prosecution authority said that they will raise the objec@@ tion to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objec@@ tion could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ug@@ ly schools were fired from F@@ ury and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen for vac@@ ations and in the continuing schools .
three of the students are going to school in the high school , four at the secondary school .
school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bi@@ es@@ ental house in E@@ min@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
as a symbol for the school release , the 29 students of the four classes were elected under Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
for this purpose , the lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot;
peas@@ ant Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his poultry .
instead of a hen , a small eagle came out .
but hope of making a chicken out of him , the e@@ agles spread on a high mountain off his wings and fled .
after that , the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank found a chicken .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders , around the bet .
the eagle stand for the integration , said school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish every fourth @-@ t@@ ug@@ ly that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed Dan@@ kes@@ on to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who once again jumps on ped@@ agog@@ y , and the parents represent the parents .
the Kü@@ ken@@ ess is over , the class@@ mates Sophia Schumacher declared .
they leave their pupils after two years of course only very ung@@ ers , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ kl@@ äss@@ ler .
finally , all students en@@ roll a song of summer time and holiday season .
in this process , great joy broke out .
the new school year has been registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece

on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , police arrested a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation is running .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have sharp@@ ened control of the free camp@@ en and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not responsible for this purpose .

software update for diesel vehicles : what to know those affected now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software have offered software updates for about 5.3 million cars .
it is intended to improve the emission behavior of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the edited software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to the vehicles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the power station Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers inform about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an ongoing implementation in the next few months , but not yet called exact date .
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write any kind of those affected .
if it is due to an inspection , it will be done in their context .
how long shall the conver@@ sions withdraw into a total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
the connections from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen voluntarily , the autom@@ akers act on the issue of the environment so far . &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming could be an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do that do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE does not wait for a wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would count , so S@@ met@@ al@@ anine .
is there a massive discount of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the Ace fears that .
but even in the regions where bicycles are dro@@ pping .
in rural area there is no value @-@ loss for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale yet .

the first prize ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday this year , singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ ers in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .

we make the city vibrant
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to retirement in the coming year .
the place is already written - but appropriate applicants are rare .
since 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun , as it con@@ veys in the press conference .
it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time , we wonder that there is no application for the requirements profile so far .
the city is searching for an architect or building engineer at the next time .
this is supposed to be still enough time for one of the regular work periods - even enough time .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as the sub@@ ordin@@ ation authority , the candidate must submit relevant connections .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they cannot fill this out more , the citizen would have to travel to Offen@@ burg by Offen@@ burg .
but the city is near , and it is important to him , &quot; W@@ acker that tells of good operational climate as well as a good mood between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , based on the chi@@ pper with pride .
&quot; we are making the city lively , &quot; it is secure on the building office and its employees .
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the resh@@ aping of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the low @-@ floor parking lot are encountered .
the kin@@ da bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the state @-@ san@@ itation is still subject .
the latter alone will sm@@ ash around 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; when we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my followers .
the work here is fun . &quot;
an old master space is present for a municipal master .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener could not be re@@ acted very flexi@@ bly .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green plants will often comm@@ end with citizens and visitors .
since the old town is standing under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to do what is clean , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ izes the schei@@ d city builder .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has high responsibility anyway .
he is builder , &quot; at the end it runs all over my table . &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ a@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been involved with Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
also , his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good environment , but also for the further design of the city .
if you like Roland W@@ acker , the city of Has@@ lach should provide a closed studies as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor with the architecture of architecture and have a good knowledge of expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .
building planning , construction and civil engineering , construction planning , business planning , urban rec@@ itals , urban factory building with building yard and municipal estate , as well as the sub @-@ building authority , including monument protection .
bike on lines are thrown : southern railroad closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the train to the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so strongly damaged , that the end @-@ up freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators are out of two male lines and looking for the night hours after them .
close to the crime scene were a ro@@ sar@@ oter escal@@ ator and a bike rider had been observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A .
the or the perpet@@ rators had brought itself into great danger , even at risk of train .
besides the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail transport could also be added to the perpet@@ rators .
for a total of &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be led without Dis@@ abilities .
there were almost ten min@@ ders of concerts in the morning , two of them see remote traffic .
freight trains failed , but they had delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced about 200 m lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation ) to lin@@ t
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and bladder , recur@@ ring or bloody accidents , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are normally taken to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins which contributes to the essential amino acid which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hide in food , not into the body .
cells that are im@@ able to dissolve inflammation , are balanced by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body , without sensitive tissues .
if the balance is incl@@ ined towards inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was found that a sort of tolerance by immun@@ ity occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its ent@@ rails .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ous , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han which had mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han varied diet toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system is sp@@ inning in humans .
the post@@ doctoral fellow in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study wers had such cells , but another group of the same stem , which was separated from the same way that had not been separated .
it susp@@ ects that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the number of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced , and were found six bacterial species , which were present in mice with immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were drawn up in a ster@@ il@@ en environment so that they were missing a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria began to grow on the immune system , the researchers abandoned L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then over@@ led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component of the liquid was cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant competitive cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal tra@@ ps .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in people like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; Genius &quot;
Manchester United has signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; Genius &quot; that Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria in Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds sub@@ title of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup for Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impressive in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the Blues and finished only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho refused to improve the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho is his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had another three new commitment , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four senior new commitment to meet .
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington &apos;s State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers on the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar sensor , the form of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new civil service for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind revol@@ ves around : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD boss , S &amp; D leader of Prime Minister always remained with certain concern after Berlin .
only there is no noise from the party &apos;s party , just no anti@@ wind from the federal government - so the most important desire of the electoral struggle .
since Martin Schulz has been leading the party , has fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated regional capit@@ als .
what Mr Schulz has been given since the beginning of the year , it wouldn &apos;t be described with the head@@ winds .
there were civil sur@@ charges .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal government is a generic signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ Green is simply not reliable , &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial office in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising leader of a green parliament has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the country code , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the Opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ President Michael Kell@@ ner , the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner was invited to return to their mandate .
the tre@@ ad to the CDU means a clear degra@@ dation of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Chancellor and electoral campaign of the Green Party network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; it must not be true , &quot; he sigh@@ ed a SPD election campaign , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ ship party was reached on Friday morning .
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands according to the remains of the green dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ west to the CDU without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ers started an unexpected defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comra@@ des were delighted .
according to the State elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then - and indeed everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to s@@ wa@@ iter , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party until smooth .
so the comra@@ des fell again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when she had made new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his town burnt .
and because he had so much wrong in crisis communications , which one can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z fights for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ gas aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister already stood in criticism .
mi@@ xes were added .
nevertheless , or maybe , because , because of the past few weeks , Weil always tried again to set acc@@ ents in the league .
the existence of the former Mayor of Hannover to build his power in Berlin , was also not hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they spoke of a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , because of the part@@ isan , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green is basically no fault .
and Schulz certainly not at all .
sometimes , comra@@ des therefore stri@@ ve to keep its own ranks .
their wrath is focused on the green , and here especially on the revol@@ ting par@@ liament@@ arians in T@@ west .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democr@@ ati@@ es@@ thes@@ es such as Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets on their own car@@ ri@@ ents on the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party t@@ ines in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ west is not elected for its person as direct can@@ did@@ ature , but on the regional list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party , so the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on par@@ liament@@ arians on .
the logical consequence would be that it returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; innocent maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the voters before four years ago it was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil appointed Minister @-@ President , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Dutch SPD as a leading candidate to the Bundestag election to the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he urged to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or further comm@@ it@@ ments of the CDU Niedersachsen .
support for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to be able to san@@ iti@@ ze his house in the years , can be obtained next assistance from the country .
on this , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative Ste@@ g urban development on Wednesday in sens@@ ing .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review to the date of events .
since 1991 it has been giving in sens@@ ory san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the result was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the inner development , and not just connect new building areas .
on April 4 , we received the information from the gover@@ ning government Karlsruhe , that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount tot@@ alling 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community sens@@ ory .
how does a renovation work now ?
one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest arise , to san@@ itation .
if there could be , the area limits could then move again again .
on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
in the basement , the Federation presented the Federation of the Federation Program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the san@@ ations would then be performed .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the residential and working conditions , preser@@ ving and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would have objective , that is , per plot , is carried out .
the renovation area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 , until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the stock intake should only be carried out , as part of those involved in the san@@ itation area involved a questionnaire .
in November or December , the spotlight will be made possible to begin with the restoration in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that each commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is about to evaluate the urban@@ isation of abuse , and to decide when san@@ it@@ ates and in which scope .
it will then be entered for the respective property also a san@@ itation gra@@ d@@ k in the base book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ing again and make a picture of the position , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow Quest@@ ion@@ na@@ ire is the &quot; building and plot of land &quot; with which it works among other things to build the structural condition and restoration views .
in the grey Quest@@ ion@@ na@@ ire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; data can be made up to size , distribution and residents of a residential space .
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only to fill in the building of business rooms .
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .
moreover , re@@ building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still stressed that the distribution of funding for the &quot; Wind@@ mill principle &quot; - who comes first comes first .
one could not reserve funding for later &quot; reserve . &quot;
in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make the closing a refurb@@ ishment &quot; pal@@ atable . &quot;
British inventor himself is a micro@@ chip to come with a hand @-@ movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door to his office and can even start his car with a hand@@ motion .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and index and now provides the service for companies and individuals who want their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ists in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event which highlights the American production in the last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military that were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American Bau@@ programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 countries .
the helicopter was exhibited in Connecticut , alongside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi .
the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I only wanted you to be aware because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its su@@ peri@@ ors , the Deputy Navy commander for aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning to the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the La@@ wn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
during the event , the original aviation crew was during the helicopter while security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
out of the articles provided by the TIM@@ E were not clear , whether a second flight crew was required .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal states to use government property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 was asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we introduced , was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; it sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to con@@ strain the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically adv@@ anta@@ geous purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but using only for a photo surgery , it is unusual .
Tr@@ ump resulted in an investigation as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the vice @-@ chair of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to ex@@ pose the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 exercise through the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was one of the training requirements for the month , said an official .
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps who were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved , to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ed drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the US Ministry of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D certificate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hours .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the regional base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , revenue sets for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract statements .
at this time , the former press pre@@ press of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked .
it is , of course , reas@@ onably priced . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump and representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky talked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC @-@ Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
top right of the Second Tennis Bundesliga team will enter the S@@ V table for the standings in the standings .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11@@ am in Kiel in the standings third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games still , mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance has become the top right of the Second Tennis Bundesliga to receive the sense for reality .
anyway , we have respect to the opponent team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays quite similar formation .
I think of the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; the Danish and Finn@@ s can even prove their missions in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this is how difficult for us .
you also need good luck . &quot;
the new@@ uss@@ ers team for the trip in the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
in the moment , at the moment the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella is not one of the Bundesliga match in the Italian Bi@@ ella , who comes to the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) in his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ inhabited Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski on the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ b@@ üh@@ el at the ball .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t work when he sat on Wed@@ nes@@ days under the law for the tigh@@ tening of the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his vo@@ ws to adopt the law , &quot; the Congress passed a couple of &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot;
also the reaction of Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ ams against the US incident .
at least , the design is planning to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians help to build gas pi@@ pelines into the EU .
accordingly , investors from the local O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ wing service north Stream 2 .
the threat is mighty .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed , which the group could fight , and which could really be we@@ aving to him .
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is caught in the chart of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos who reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over .
the seasons are three and four were confirmed by streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ lain of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as a Fortune 500 company , &quot; only with more state taxation and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( San Denis ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) command the Mexican connection and Che@@ pe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published Tra@@ iler Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colum@@ bian law en@@ forcement agencies , which invites war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .

roll back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen aid
the town organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with solid contacts for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care venues the clock is turned back .
on 1 September , the town of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the department of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; we have all very pleased with us . &quot;
cooking is still cooked except the house : a cat@@ er takes over this task and provides fresh cooked co@@ ols .
the city operates in the field of 46 children &apos;s venues , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunch time .
in the last kit@@ ten year , 2800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 partial forces have delivered the angel@@ ic food from the 1st of September . they have warm the angel@@ ic meals , complement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individual , leave the food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group @-@ group@@ ed institutions - decides about the hour@@ ly rate .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; so they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts for the kit@@ esur@@ fing . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; the children are supposed to be willing to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaning@@ fully .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;

G@@ MB concerns about investment in Mc@@ Vit@@ ie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union is interested in managers at the Bis@@ c@@ ite producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , along with other products hob@@ by@@ bs and rich tea cookies .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives said &quot; the first experience &quot; would change their activities .
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; concerns expressed that the financing of production lines should not be driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ iser Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity over the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross .
generations of families have worked here and the labour force focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow - an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged .
hence , under the perspective of employment , wage and welfare , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising energy efficiency and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow are urg@@ ently a thri@@ ving production facility at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
speaking in Pla@@ dis , said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter of G@@ MB of Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , as we represent the ongoing commitment with employees and trade union representatives .
we had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we operate like all enterprises who are working in an extremely competitive and safe economic climate , our business is constantly checking - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
it added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operative improvements .
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and completely to change . should our business processes change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ends
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in her persecution from Ne@@ ym@@ ar after being issued a bid of £ 189 million to resolve his free@@ wheel clause , but they warned Barcelona before the world record three years ago ?
the sensational approach changed the transition window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious via the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans project insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President ?
as Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in themselves , this consequences will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line with the Spanish Society at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly stated that they would not allow it to the International from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of her price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ spar@@ row reports un@@ loading pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row report on the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the sc@@ andal pl@@ sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ sen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would last for its deepest regret or its then false assessment of the processes .
the Vatican Chancellor , &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the reporting on violence with &quot; two different levels . &quot;
regarding the handles in Regensburg , no one knew that it would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and preparing the public opinion to keep that for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go on the church and this is a second fres@@ her . &quot;
in addition , it pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats had been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to be finished with young children , as I was one . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to use present standards in past decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse cases often , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder band &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he considers the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg , with the clari@@ fication of attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were made sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s . &quot; victims of attacked , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ rows are sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it &apos;s said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can hold on that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
the punishment for the students could also be cut off at high levels .
in contrast to many other restrictions , many of the victims were estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
in the interview E@@ emann , in the interview , E@@ emann , said the final report to the mis@@ fortune sc@@ andal at the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger district of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence on protective fo@@ es at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; exists a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a lift up many students &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
for the other , it appears as chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has become more tan@@ gible when an Dom@@ sp@@ atz did not have a top performance .
how do you analyze this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you are doing the effort and reads the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you should rather ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has to be found at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of Mitt@@ al or fellow @-@ ser@@ en@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the role of violence at the Pre @-@ school took place outside of its work sphere .
you can do it if necessary , too late or first clari@@ fications do not have taken seriously .
the Dom@@ estic Product , on which he worked , was experienced by practically all those surveyed - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is a very excellent witness , describes it as a &quot; warm her@@ ently , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; comprehen@@ sible teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about his perf@@ ect@@ ism and its high emotional quality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ eres .
that he didn &apos;t only cast them with chairs and put the key@@ ring on the ground , but also ear@@ ne@@ stly guys distributed to hair or ears , he already regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used , with parents such as teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced that in a world@@ ly school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violence on the school , are liber@@ ally Bag@@ at@@ ella .
there they wonder whether it is not more with its popularity and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media has just stor@@ med him .
on the Bavarian Pope there are many , who never understood it , still e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report gives Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the context of the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also publishes any transaction or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they have not been concerned with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , but he certainly would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how to evaluate the Dom@@ spar@@ row students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he counted ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) who would have had his final findings and could stop the perpet@@ rators .
I keep it ... also for real absurd , to assume that it is expected to be more urgent and clear@@ er , or rather opened , as opposed to their parents , interventions , trust teachers etc .
that one speaks about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in advance , students and / or their surroundings were confi@@ dential , could not be confirmed in the scope of the study . &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore exemp@@ t from every contribut@@ or to each other .
so it cannot be accused of having to be prevented or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ ted crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; violence to eat &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ atzen was to read .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused in the report &quot; directions . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and bl@@ ended to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that &apos;s exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is also clean separated : between the pre@@ school and the gym@@ nasium of dom@@ ites , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we once again say other pre@@ ferences .
in addition , the report provided inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ c teachers have been properly cha@@ ired and mal@@ ici@@ ally , all took place at the Pre @-@ School in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to re@@ igns .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boy first to face , as they were already on the dom@@ est@@ ial school .
on what was the most important witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise @-@ states . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ mo@@ b gramm@@ ar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not sa@@ c violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims also estimated the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
this is how the accus@@ ation remains too f@@ ish@@ ly .
but in spite of all efforts the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the conditions on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school , which he had not appeared and responsible , ( such as the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then it was only back in 1993 .
fired Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the conditions consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ nasium who even re@@ produced the report .
in this point , it indicates that in the pre @-@ school , the inspec@@ tor continued to practice . &quot;
already in the face of neg@@ atively negative health insurance , it recommended urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity , as test@@ ers , had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took part in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows about us .
there was also hard to estimate , where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the allow@@ able border had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he had always looked away .
this is just not right .
only in 1980 , the inspec@@ torate was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it is un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards at the time of time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we speak histori@@ ans from the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger , past today &apos;s moral measure .
he is quite right there .
but this is , of course , not for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s parents , that is already well beyond that .
that &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all that had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ines and punishment , so ear@@ ne@@ cro@@ ws and to pull the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , he also has kept stri@@ pped .
what is the picture of his rainy season , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger went to the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject of Prü@@ fer also came to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t miss any way that he was a str@@ ingent regim@@ ent .
but this must be said once again : without these perfection , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world leaders , true culture ambassador Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and cand@@ y alone one does not make a great singer and have no great success in any success , right in the area , yet discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome .
what a man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well met and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believing and heart of good people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something in a fly .
I &apos;ll get a regular basis with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ ik@@ es still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his release , visit him - he is almost blind - and how to treat him as a member of their family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , so clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ ites are thank@@ ful to him today that he enriched her life and brought to them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , v@@ icious teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to whom they still see and honor them .
and please , once again clearly : everything you need to do , are educational methods that were at the time at the time .
we can be glad that we have over@@ met this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin @-@ corn .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only very obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now there would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired large mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany no one would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows to finally leave peace .
