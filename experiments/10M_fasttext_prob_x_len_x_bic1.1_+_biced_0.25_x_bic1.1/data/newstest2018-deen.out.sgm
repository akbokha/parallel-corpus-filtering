<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An irren Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners generate the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not currently current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone, who had to be very exciting, because the car-Navi took place instead of a circumvent road a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlantique, an offer of the Geoportas in Bavaria of the state government, are all other than currently - yet highly recommended.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a tile carpet, which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great coverage map were conceived for cities and municipalities in detailed maps, so-called primitive leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and jumping the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the spring of 1800, French armies occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops resigned with the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbours that created the idea of a country-wide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">KurfürstMax IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Association Administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original certificate for Munich is from the year 1856, and is like all others to find on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the 1856 card.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map of the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses subcontrasted by 1856 along today's shopping street, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: in zooming appears a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called "urine" which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots spread there today no farmers more - but small gardener to the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is drawn north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the original position, the Au-Haidhausen district is not only reading the street names "at Gasteig," or from the altitude "On the air," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, one opened once people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenaissance "was founded in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden presided the facility - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and finished for example the anchoving of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he taught the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first place, later was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity wasn't enough anymore - the reason for the construction of the county seat in hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist.</seg>
<seg id="40">Youths now encounter adolescents at the Salesianum at the Areal of the former Auer institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and went into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">Located west is the football field of TSV Munich East, east residential homes from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's House "Casa Don Bosco," was built in an architectural association with the roots of the Irrenaissance building, which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as a "main square," the Kauferstraße name was "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of coin.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - on Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 will be the spatballs for the second S-Bahn station.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slipegler, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole in the Marienhof hole.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes disarmament for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farming has issued a warning for colored people who travel due to discriminating policy and racist attacks in the state of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Advisory Council for the state of Missouri until August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travellers, visitors and missourians to be carried out on journeys through the state special attention and to be noted, as a number of questionable, racial-based occurrences in the whole state can be observed and here," said it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently attempted law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to claim discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionate minority interests, the group, the travel agency, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have breaches the rights of civil rights to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped due to their skin color, they are crushed or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group zitioned incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also has shown on a recently published report of the offices of the General Prosecutor's office, in which black car drivers will be 75 percent more common in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that human beings are aware of their families, friends and employees informed about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"the people must be willing to bring justice money or the relatives that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in the year 2015, after the latest figures from the hate-breaking report of the FBI, who enters the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel is also an answer to a new Missouri Act which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the EU immigration authorities agreed to negotiate people because of migratory organs, which is to contribute to the ACLU account for further retirement schemes.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel accounts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Consecrated project is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The fender ffence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and Kordula Kovac have purchased a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right excavation of the family of Schwendemann, representatives of the Fisheracher CDU-Munichands came together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his operation in which he accommodates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwald milk" is the alternative solution for him for the milk of his cows, as swivel.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferihottest comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "elemental."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can do not profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for much work, much must be machined with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and to fight with the topography," he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the eleventh operation and maintained this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it did not lead a biodiversity.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune recognized the meaning of the consecration project and is glad about the leader-promoting."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the readings of the surfaces could still be moved out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture, and consider thoughts about how they continue their operation," the mayor was stressed.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing because of promoting often in critique</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares, which can not be checked up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of €71 million, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter led to the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">The farmers remaining 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of fences," declared swivel.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a good job, without farmers and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stand firm: "here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Force (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The forefront is the presence of one of the lpr recorded conveyor belts.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the appropriate surface should not be economical (hangar over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by refusation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisheracher Soft Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build barely 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the cost-contained costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carcingly staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of President for the drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller handle not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty Imiters would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he handle their importance, and especially the meaning that you were attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta implied: "I don't want to enter into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to which later was added, not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively rightly, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the blazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only charges any old immigrants, but the arms of the poor: "your garbage, your arms, and your oppressed masses, who are going to be free to breathe freely, the elend waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show connections between French and American republicans, showing the female embodiment of freedom in a unused classical image representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus modified this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a very different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change it long for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is allowed to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It aims to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not give the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and even a question of the Standing point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great fantasy indeed of Lazarus was in it to see how it was seen from the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It goes in the truest sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve life.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine on the way, but hate hatred, who is the only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black Praise Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle looks at a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship "will afford a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special develops" and the Athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlete think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the circumstances of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butpchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eiliie Doyle was elected to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her surrender speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or whatever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling, the Eiliie very naturally brought, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner who will compete in their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdle, says that it is "unbelievably" that 16 shots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-route Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m is another Scotsman to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle looks at her first world championships, as the only other shot in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team capitals says that they are "enormous" on the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about the Team capitals is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well established athletes, athletes, who want to rise in poets.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was good.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to use this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will be just such a great atmosphere. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you don't use the deposit of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from internal politics to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He impaired criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of expression can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we will be led as sheep for battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan, who must work in it to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">At the beginning of this week, the American Civil Liberties Union appealed him to the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counterreaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"there is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-seat approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand at the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his haired head after chemotherapy on his site.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the block of persons appearing on the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially, and of staff that will be paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesman Amelia Chasse drafted the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of Trolls or chambers or hassauled people who swinging the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest filed the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD, was not hassable, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," wrote them in the comments section of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people on the same topic, then they are recognized by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">As the staff of the governor as "concentrated Spam-Attack," others would probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to use a message by blocking a critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is a lot of cleaner than in previous time, when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical ladles and to kill or make protesters to silence and silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But it just happens.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticises that he criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is proclaiming by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she was appointed a electorate of their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt has received a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailboxes beat on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous consoles.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitioning, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and shipping with Britain criticised his position, according to the historical documents, collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have her silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and discourses are the foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership signifies that to accept.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed they had been delayed that they were irreversible with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey among more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., was also sure that the younger travelers were more mischief of the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of those surveyed, that they have attempted to fly with something that was banned by TSA, 19.7 percent millennials were compared to less than 15 percent, the members of the generation X were.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were intentionally wed to TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent stated that they have carried out objects with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they would have been deliberately prohibited drugs to the aircraft.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the triumphant figures on sales grow and even more gigantic destinations, Tesla boss Elon Musk aims for the first time to betray a different, less glittering number: the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">During the past months, Musk frequently applied more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk has dreamed: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics had always noted that it is merely a binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds).</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations before, Spilled Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, that the cancellation of so far more than twelve percent of all orders could be a problem, the Tesla boss does not believe.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth target is not on demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models have been taken - 500,000 being million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those who order today a "Model 3" must be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018, if Tesla creates it, its brand new, never tested in practice tested without any major interruption with maximum load.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="899">To assess the biological ages in this way, is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">If we can't say it certainly, we should not do so as if we could it, "he said the newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests: "in general, you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low.</seg>

<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Even though, after all we know, a health threat is practically impossible.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the explorer from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived?</seg>
<seg id="1098">The food surveillance is the task of the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Nevertheless, my house immediately shut up, and there is a close exchange of Germany's sufferers in close exchange with the authorities of the countries.</seg>

<seg id="1106">After derogitiy knowledge, production plants meets no immediate debt.</seg>
<seg id="1107">Rather, they must reckon due to illegal practices of services with economic damage.</seg>

<seg id="1112">This is precisely why a consistent advancing of such events and handover to the public bar in the cases where crimes can be found, of crucial importance.</seg>
<seg id="1113">I have already done several times repeatedly, that I expect from the responsible authorities to reconnaissile information.</seg>

<seg id="1121">As the financial rules of the soccer ball to Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unimpaired expenditures of the European football matches, Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain will not interfere.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has power, teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG has to point out some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without a great loss.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid $222 million (262 million $) to buy the Brazil from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make the money easy to make money, so Neymar, and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may apply much money for the purchase of players, but have to be able to control with legitimate revenue sources, which allow them to break the break-even point in its on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their pursuit, effectively deceiving and risky to recruit when banks or owners have moved their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP decreased from concentration to the debt of clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the crew and build a global mark - to be a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the recent three-year round-ending period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continue to refresh yourself of excessive expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared with The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it may distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the ösgerms for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players in the other ordinary 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to overlook their financial statements by allowing their revenue through companies that are associated with owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataric company could sponge the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed standard market positions, the UEFA would not apply to a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was blown by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar may come on payments from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar, in 2022, argued that Neymar WM ambassador will easily be able to figure out and find such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA is more attentive to consider any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke below the condition of Anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has a turnover of €542.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1159">In the past few years, Chocolate Frey aboard the Swiss has produced chocolates for Swiss Life.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the cooperation in front of a possible end: the airline writes the order to the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-Spreaders Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency SDA published a corresponding report of the newspaper "North West Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the Airline will shut down a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked all two to three years and checked in a quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1166">At the expense of the cost, Swiss would not want to make any information.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insider appreciates the order volume according to "North West-schweiz" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: a prestigious order is an prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Like many applicants on the new invitation, the Swiss does not want to betray the Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But in question, only Swiss producers are coming.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make a renewal of the treaty beyond spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for a statement.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80-year-years, for the 90-year-Grunge ("The State" for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But when Franchise feels like this, the time would be close.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not only because of its absurd humors (it contained a original story for a speaking tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By taking part in the core of the Gags - actor middle ages play gutter children who want to grow - did they make the impossibility to win the last part of the Witch.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults is less emotional rooted and his parody goes more according to the fountains of the 90 "s, like" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The hand that cradle the cradle ").</seg>
<seg id="1190">On one point, a character of the Apple Powerbook, some inline Skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The charming Coop (Mr. Shoo), now Romanautor, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has never lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another mad plot, in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Shoot), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exercise classes are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who reveals the Matt Dos underlippard of "singles" whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old Knacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise: "Wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "Glow" with its East-west ring battle-iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy performed by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created a found TV series: Romanian Drama of the eighties with both policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who are fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-healer Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues from Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English will be synchronized.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice Gags to see the police (the police spend time when watching chess on TV, such as Americans may do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda Drums - a killer who carries a Reagan-mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">At six long episodes it moves, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was reedited on a smaller length, his Agitprop-Satire could be able to visit his agitprop-Satire, as Gregor and Iosef will always visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who spends a heap of Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The embassy for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a gage.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictive Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with Ihmese.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Blow against drug-mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police managed a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched for the public prosecutor's office in Constance on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">During the age of 25 and 77 years, 15 were arrested and already issued warrants for these arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officers provided greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, as well as several hundred thousand Euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same Razcia in Italy two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two will therefore be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Over 300 policemen were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia is accused of drug criminality, severe violence, attempted murder, and robbery.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office was determined against organised drug dealers in the southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public bar in Constance and Palermo there was a real exchange and investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Hence, the large insert on Wednesday morning were also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">There are mainly Italian national nationals combined with regard to Italian mafia.</seg>

<seg id="1227">"data from citizens who shouldn't appear": according to a report, the foreigner register has significant shortcomings in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1228">That lead to part of serious misdecisions at asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1229">According to the Federal Government's refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, a media report, according to a media report, has shown attention to large gaps in the extension centre.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Shortcomings of the data could be registered with asylum procedures and deportation, "in part, in a analysis that lies ahead of the" Süddeutsche Zeitung. "</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to the Register, ten million people are reported by foreign nationals, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data will therefore be administrated by about 600 foreign agencies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data has not been maintained enough, the data quality in parts have not been good far.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In some cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are far more alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"defective data collected significantly slow down," says it continues to the report.</seg>
<seg id="1236">In statistics about foreign-out people, the EU citizens should not exceed, which would not have to travel.</seg>
<seg id="1237">But such false assignments led "to a discontinued debate on the handling of travellers," so it is in the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the government has apparently begun to return to Italy with 16-year-old children, when they arrived there from there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">This is out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the "New Osnabre Newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="1240">According to the paper, the BAMF will bring such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1241">Since the end of 2014, it was virtually no longer possible, the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation would have dampened the speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth "orders will remain, when they maintain interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Bank's policy makers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2, interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In their fourth annual inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth prognosis for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on the household income would continue to continue with inflation in the fall expected to rise to just under 3%.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But they signalized that in the next few years, interest rates would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Brexit, and she said that the charges might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mammut business package that was published a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will require time for the financial plan to provide budget funding for banks in order to provide budget funding for banks as expected from the coming February, that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "in the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak, because pressure on the realation of households will continue to supply the consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">At the rate of interest they repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be required for the cooling of inflation and a "slightly larger" extent to expect the markets.</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets currently projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">The bank, however, emphasized that increases "gradually" and "limits."</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank forecast downwards forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to those in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth prognosis to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell by these messages compared to the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have steamed up increasing expectations for an interest rate, and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% to 0.3% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to rise at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is slightly recovering from the Bank at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1280">The latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and low-term salary, since the tightening of the tightening is even worse before it becomes better.</seg>

<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British quality, which is due to weak pounds, which is a part of the lower consumption expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes to a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the funicism.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the last judgment of the Bank, the call for interest rates increased, since inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="1286">The inflation decreased last month of 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected to put on back in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the aims at the rate in relation to their goal of 2% be "quite" to the weak Pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Montume, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "in view of the shortest response of the swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive, as the creditors want to end strong for businesses and would like to end the year in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1289">The market is especially good for those in which the existing Deals are running and the new mortgages include, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "</seg>

<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that prior to the intercourse occupancy phylaxe (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk provisioning by around 86 percent, now the health service is delivered by a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>

<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission with infectious diseases.</seg>

<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">To those who come to the question are gay or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV-positive partners who were not treated successfully.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Clinics are identified suitable for participants that agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV-status is not known by antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who are living in England and registered at a resident, can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will receive £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs in this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by clinical analysis, how it is targeted and implemented in a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should be the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and overtake them.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their pockets and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I've been in love with them and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first time, the 1,000 square foot has been overhauled completely.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a scanned layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add joanne storage space and a mezzanine to make the spacious ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel structure is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without leaving us to gaps.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height at the top or down the right height. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled it to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of skewers plays a role while adding theatre, room and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, reflections feel like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units for all the triangles and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan of the steel amplifiers, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is reciprocal so it is when you push out the door, very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to cleverable use of room and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high quality materials, which procure the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are things which you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a apartment can be turned through good design and increased square metercount of somewhat standard in something quite astonishment.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dynasty, in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate in Victorias, worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the "Carlton football club" and developers Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors of his younger brother Paul. this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business activity shall be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco jeans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father Colin - from Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul is about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial authorities say that Colin property has a value of $316 million and a value of $176 million in value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of property and cash has been proved for Paul as a proving point.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the statements of Colin proposed victims have left him with the left what I kept for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in an initial affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The first hearing of the Supreme Court ruling took place on Friday last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers also fight for control over the existing business - where Colin claimed that Paul claimed to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some owners incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affair that was filed by Colin, he says he hope to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage shows that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides of the Bar Association.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her cloister husband Luigi was Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950-80s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used security to buy the Collingwood song, in Colin the first jeanske of the family opened.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco as he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their inheritance to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said," "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group group, with Colin claims that Mark were paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are as well as Mark, so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept himself very well, even though he was a former AFL executive board and after a biography one year 2015 by Eddie McGuire's best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can really not say much," because the case was before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our family name by the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media Abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have attempted and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it actually.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first day of working with conducting employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House to repair it: bad news that got into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions, if he would receive good news. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have attempted to tame Trump by monitor its media services.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television goes back to decades - and now where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate was offended because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit consists of control, according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter are ever "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets could have not included even more spark plugs.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn about the tweets that the trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When his staff had made it a few times, trouble from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House consists of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by making trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants, presidents of strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former tramump officials say that Trump is how a volcano can react to negative press lines, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he can find out what these originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone accused the President of evil displeased a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter or that he has no specific evidence, or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and refuses them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask people over Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and documentate the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to prove the most effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still searching for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">This unchangeable factors make the Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Master of selected criminals get post by Europol</seg>

<seg id="1421">Since the addresses of the requested heavy criminals are not known, they are hoping for evidence of the population and to pray.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Europol reported on Friday from the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from the winter.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The experiences have shown that many volatile holiday destinations hide, it was called Europol.</seg>

<seg id="1427">Travelers negotiate over one ditch and return to the 'Millionärs series'</seg>
<seg id="1428">Some of the wealthiest home owners of West Midlands are back with some determined travelers at the foot of war, which have negotiated a ditch from the municipality in order to demand a field in front of their men's houses.</seg>
<seg id="1429">The travelers have parked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the "Millionärs series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">They have brought horses, babies and an army of transporting them after they were cancelled only in May, without being deported from the burial of burial ditch to prevent their accidents.</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense system and pushed their vehicles through a section called unimpeded to find a road.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Angry residents have pushed the advice of Solihull, who said it would be "useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said: "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent away by Bentley Heath, where they have thrown stones on the passers.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must act through shame on the implementation, since he was useless when dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1435">The travelers were there in May, have been moved and are now back again.</seg>
<seg id="1436">More came yesterday evening, probably today more. "</seg>
<seg id="1437">She added: "the Council of Birmingham knows how to push for long submissions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="1438">I live without the streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to pay attention to my community if the Council cannot stop this. "</seg>
<seg id="1439">A resident who didn't want to be called, said: "it is ridiculous, we just have seen the last round of these travellers, only to be looted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="1440">The figures have increased this time and even saw a horse in the park area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">Speaking in the Council of Solihull said: "we are aware of an unauthorised bearing on the land beyond the streetsbrook Road and work together with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to support our evidence, it is very important that as many local residents report a anti-social or criminal behavior when they call 101 by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="1443">This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we propose our case. "</seg>
<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstein is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">That's good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof at the time of the Hotel Birkenhof during the then ambiance of the company mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year was lost and also revenues generated by the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the estate and as a collective accommodation, which was provided for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not uncontested at the time of the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstein's Mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the site, and he already spoke of serious interested parties to the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhancements with Managing Director Birgit Scherer in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Manor alb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the earlier Hotel Birkenhof, there has been a long time construction container before the entrance, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovations are made.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn apart, ceilings to part, old bathtubs from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire property building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is much to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is supposed to be renewed in the Schwarzwald style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large-walk showers, the entrance area is surrounded, new windows are fitted.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything was later called "beautiful bourgeois" as Thomas Scherer expresses.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a lot of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">We would not move to the high level of the hotels in LauterBath, but already on a upscale city level, emphasizes Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms to spread broad, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual travellers, groups or businessmen are supposed to feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause he already led, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's performances are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer wants not to set up exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outer plants are also brought to front, this is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, a large terrace that is open from the restaurant, the public will be accessible.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic about: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia's Affair: us special Jury sets the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair to US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is expected to have a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel recorded work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under vocation with the cause confided.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there is already first incidents of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps, oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for longer, targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there was a conversation between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are supposed to stand in campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the Washington Post published a few weeks ago that the Special Representative Trump personally picked up the center and examined the accusation, whether the president may impeded the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to prove and decide to check and decide whether the charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called count.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Usually it is switched on, if it is greater and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons on awareness among Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the transmitter, CNN has already been issued unloading, turning around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in meetings were asked to be a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his damaging campaign manager Paul Manacontinue along with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the objection show that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that he should be needed quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the interpretation of a new phase in research and a new reason for President Trump, is the beginning of a new phase.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations took the President on Thursday night a speech in West Virginia to depict Russia's affair as campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme give the Democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about it. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he knows nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually work in obedience, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House provides all measures aimed at expedited the work of the special agent on "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not to be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rains there were accusations against Trump, he would hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump made him an attitude of investigations against the then national security adviser, Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to representation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special-mediator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The speculation solved them whether Trump Mueller was released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special newspaper of Congress such as in the Watergate affair around the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller has fired a position in which he could be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice in theory.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators were submitted to the legislature on Thursday, after which the special educators could no longer be released.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg is driving in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Arctic, a gigantic iceberg has been replaced by the scarf at the barely seven-fold size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This distributed the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres large colonel is driven to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest icants who have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">In what extent the climate change played a role in the crash of the iceberg, according to research data is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual conjunctions in the region for some 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelbans so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Smelly floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeira is located south of South America almost on the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shooting was the equilibrium of waxing, and disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scarf was crushed there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelbow was in danger, as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as that.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate standing under tension and could be broken down, if a piece set off at a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt of gravel and iceberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and dripping so much water as it makes it to melt.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the gun leads the glaciers directly into the sea, and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in small measurements, the British research project writes the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelsolemn is the fourth biggest scarf of Antarctica according to AWI-Sands with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the mainland from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural thing and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice plate is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most important retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists were contested whether the Larsen-C-Schellipse can now grow again or in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this trend will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, so in the past decades the Antarctic peninsula has fallen very many of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature increases.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Antarctic peninsula has passed around three degrees in the past 50 years and tame them in the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1562">The aim is to uncover just short periods of skilled workers, but to meet forward-orientations of the candidate's shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented toward the inside and outside, to show concrete action for cross-climbers and include a training offensive, the CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">For the circle has to do with personal problems we did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a real "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">This comes to a high number of employees working in the service or age caused by the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Thus, the highest time to act, so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, continues with his party even beyond the common application.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He has long already looked into the chalk for a fouthed surprise when he publicly exhibited the recruitment of personnel and the remaining parties.</seg>

<seg id="1573">"if we do not come up to a satisfactory solution here, the county administration should also go with the trade unions - maybe in collaboration with the county-affiliated towns - a building rate."</seg>
<seg id="1574">Thus, the CDU, the employees and officials tried to pay better when the rates for the public service actually sees.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently mandatory, enhancements or more money there is only if you move into a higher level, which orientates itself in professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have always grown more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not write a new conduct of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rager' because their crew effectively worked together with human hands in a way that lightened illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which is in operation only since one year, rejected the Italian state-walts Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on social media.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can see all the excuses that are currently collected, only after we collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Ramed', the Iuventa, supervised since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that his crew members will be delivered on board, which can be delivered directly from men's hands, and that the smugglers can be used again, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the dictator of the state-forest, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of investigating the authority of Italian coast guards, who monitors the ambulances in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not out of any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats must have monitored boats such as Iuventa, especially an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to keep himself to the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessarily, but acceptable, because they would not bring "essential changes or disability" to their lifeactions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winner doctors without borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy had strongly declined in the past weeks, which insisted that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and carried the cooperation with the local civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1596">He gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Increase and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilers biker, the "Berliner outposts" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the northern pfalz region to enjoy four days of tribunals and landmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friends were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation at the Wachenheimer Valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour started on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">They followed lookout points, partly on towers, of which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the pre-bearing levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">There was always a longer climb for the long time for the long time.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and for the People's fest Wurmmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again the lookout point moves to lookout spot, connected by "flowige" Trials and moderate Ascension.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days, there were again many altitude meter.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caverns, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cottages brought wills breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers located in the freewheel centre of healing brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters, the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best site - sporty and cultural.</seg>

<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long been to a serious industry to become a lucrative business - great stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high rings.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This also recognized the first federal ligaveraveraging in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1623">"real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will go into the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all the markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-sportsers under contract, one could be present online more often on these markets than just once in the year, to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">Why is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">Computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football-simulation FIFA at competitive edge.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, Lies have long been established, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And with the rest of Asia, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froby also dealt with the question long with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports- University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that one can find even in classical sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress transactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Furthermore, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response rate.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers shouldn't just exercise on the console but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the best player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">However, Froby also sees problems: "doping is becoming increasingly a subject."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult in online gaming, and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Scientists emphasizes the high-inclusive effect of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are travelling internationally, which is like a great global family, there is no intercultural shirts.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by management consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) tells the e-sport a rapid growth ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, there were 50 million euros in Germany, mainly regarding advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales will be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga, this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice-hockey, "write the Deloitte consultants.</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Basiallstar Alex Rodriguez is taking part in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>

<seg id="1649">There is a lot in Europe too.</seg>

<seg id="1651">In the Netherlands and France, the soccer League-League-clubs according to Dutt has now been obliged to set up an e-sport department.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany left behind," VfB-Management of Röttgermann explains.</seg>
<seg id="1653">Only in nostalgia to fall, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough.</seg>
<seg id="1654">It is about keeping the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she has encouraged her boyfriend by texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to currency.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted in June due to his negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy spoke on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is no comforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until the vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but their legal representatives argued that both they had had a mental illness as well as Mr Roy.</seg>
<seg id="1669">In red trousers and a cream-coloured bluse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, folded hands and downward eyes when they were condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the State lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has no responsibility taken, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters attorney said it was a "awful circumstance that it is completely unfortunate."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he didn't find out that her "Age or Reifegrad or even her spirit disease have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A public prosecutor, a statement by Roys Mutter Lynn Roy, the said that there is no day that I didn't give the loss of my beloved Son.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to set a justification of precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime that calls for others to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case referred to national attention after Carters Textmaker revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hanging up, spring from a building, walk yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that had sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the eyes of his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad," and "Everything that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press from the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The legal opinion has shared.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To the few, Carter defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to Italy in 2007, was sentenced to death in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research initiative, CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and in autumn much more.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employee of the weekly newspaper Rioce meet usually on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what is safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, Neutrale, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporters, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug adugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being suspected of the administration list or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that are dangerous to the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rustint of violence, and while in all the country the bodies are common, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto opened its position in December 2012. 589 has been led to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now, there were at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator by Rioce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack of absence becomes deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows its middle finger with the word "Justice," hung on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discussing their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although it was built in 2010 by the General Prosecutor of the Confederation, it was directed to only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee to the Protection of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trade and organic crimes, the murderers are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Rioce they still have to deal with the violence of Sinaloa while they are unpaved and even though the terrain is still avourable.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security concerns little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we suspicious all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rioce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He was able to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the 12th River.</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter was driving away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans was arrested in the past year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields of land, as rival factions here fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't mean that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-storey mausoleeen for drug adresses that are greater than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially, in February, the publication of a interviews with Damasco Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cartons in war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have offended the sons, the Ganges purchased each copy of the output, as soon as she was delivered to newspaper cosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez, after the arrest of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined with five colleagues from the establishment of Rioce and sold 50 US dollars shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without losing the antidote problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest coverage, and the turnover and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treading examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by an publication that they could read stories that nobody else did to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Rioce she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drugs history, where they always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily, that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take up the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in view of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Rioce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird, who, like a harbour worker, could curse the boyfriend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He always would carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He always would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go there always at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced to ask her own involvement in question, how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-sur and self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instants.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are not in Sinaloa no longer - exactly as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggelding, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Rioce met for security training, no cell phones were allowed. days previously announced that spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen sought protection from heat from 104 degrees Celsius (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices from Rioce in a small-class quarters of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in joke, some of the reporters, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who described the governor himself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug admits are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Rioce left three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former magician Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to state spending, focusing on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally owned by drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Political Party (pri), who ruled all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors were accused of corruption due to high-caliber cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers have watched the columne of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sticker, dedicated to the murders of journalists, because the employees had become something that they would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Replica Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the morning due to another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor's Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists had become stronger in the whole country by sending them in organised protests "SOS Press" on obedience and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send journalists and kill them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she is again divided from the government, because she is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez was repeatedly said that journalists gathered in Mexico by organizing crime, concerned government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug admits but also on orders of politicians and security forces, who were interned with the organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">In the past year, the media group "Articulo 19" has identified more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you live because they want you to hold your mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one gets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headset were next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua, following the assassination of the correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others do on how it did El manana of Nuevo Laredo, after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">2010 was the Diario de Ciudad Juarez public to the drug box with a Editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and still observe the streets and looking for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted as apparently by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who keep back and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, indicates that the drug dealers are troubled at him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to Hell, and therefore I became reporters," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Rioce sat on the pavement before the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to sums.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shotters with bandages and security forces near the Mazatlan beach had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the curbstones they have published the news on the website of Rioce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens rulls nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers, the guard stopped to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the enormous portrait of the greener of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Rioce followed his tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "when Javier was assassinated on the same day, the practitioner asked me to send them on the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to exert his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first glance, it looks like a statue, even a scary.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers found out that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinocorns of a Canadian miners were so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that it was able to realize that his gloves were of reddish brown - and they said they would have had something from a "unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the preserved pandeed Dinosaurs who ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretacetime between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-grown state has researchers that describe it as "truly remarkable" blossoms</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the vegetable plant hereaters is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that appeared from the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has been sleeping," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant hereater, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a walk-like tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong Dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators, and used a parachuting technique used as counteratting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better in its surroundings and soaking his enemies, experts, what it suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creation from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and now is now visible in the Royal Tyrrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now have studied wild animal and studied Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of specimen enabled us to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the conveyors, a widespread defence method in animal, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the tertices is common, the results are surprisingly, since the size of Borealopelta exceeds by far the living animals survives.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution of the confrontation was taken as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, which apply the conveyors - think of deer, Zebras or girdules - are much smaller and injurious than prey, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a true struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strongly geared Dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs premules of the Cretaceous have to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur bay rotates.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his final Darmintes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river and driven into the sea, where he sunk on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with contractual skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal maintains," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks almost as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstructing it. if you are only a little with the eyes of Schielen, you could almost believe that it is in sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge thermopods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, was hunted by the pandeed Dinosaurs of some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology journal, believe that Borealopelta was sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creation was found by Shawn Funk, when he was found on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved pandeed dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters long) and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the shredded plant-eaters was swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater fishing of the dinosaurs keep his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remnants of this particular specimen are so good that the Hautrek still cover holed tank plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more I despise it.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the holden-cut tank plates that bear the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on its side, his five fingers spread upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole. '</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: mass arambolage to A8: lots of injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">A great accident on Thursday night at the A8: nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, kilometerlong Staus - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), on the late morning of Thursday afternoon, about 20 people have been injured.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) were just under 30 vehicles, including trucks, sometimes trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">About the exact number of injuries were initially no information before.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was about light to moderate injuries, a policeman said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A big tribute to rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In driving Munich, a ten-kilometer long return was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As a AZ reporter reported, it was also on the counter-way to massive Disabilities - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The firefighters notated the trademarks of the vehicle-lenders, which now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 I took a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It was a collision between Autotranorters and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A bailer helicopter was on the way to accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: Group testing "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffer.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the Schaffner and wakes up an unclean, or takes the driving place in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Driving card control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently examining the create driving card control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone, taken at its place and evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">At present, a test operation runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"comes the offer, wide we come from.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available at many other remote locations in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a train speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the rail ticket rankings without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased on the app by rail, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort Check-in" works as follows: one climbs into the train, calling out his ticket under "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test clients, a button to the electronic devaluation will be published.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The trainers get a message on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat field Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the driver checkbox comes in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already-off-off ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying staff, check in the DB Navigator just yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to make their travel time in the move of personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Manager of DB remote traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Who often rides there, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains the ticket checks are among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case, one of the passengers don't have all documents that you need for devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document, which one must indicate.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The episode are endless discussions between migratory and driving pleasure, which leads to a bad mood in the auditor or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and the Schaffner at the end that takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Additional access numbers on the same track are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her heart.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after it arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented and scroll by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled over a post by someone from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police has just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it was there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else had posted information on their feedback, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed for their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was there, the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of brooch leblosem body, which was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thinking Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She made her cell phone to return to tweets on the Canfield drive later on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription: "Fergusons police killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a rebellious dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said that another policeman asked his rifle and cried: "I will kill you... all of you kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not customary," and Ferrell remembered her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the type of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can call it."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return trip and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell passed away with her daughter who drove a flower dress and a crown crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remembered how I taught you when black people have to fight for those who believe in?" she remembered what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her away, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a climax of its... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It needs to know and see it and be mounted in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience in which they do not experience any kind of racism, it is not unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel that I would prove a bad service to keep them far off. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that was transferred to a camping area than the activists on the possible non-charges of Officers Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass by demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to accept Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after August 9," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food-righteousness and health inequalities in black churches.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to be "documented," what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell's sense: "are you documented or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from the White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices have not centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browsing.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me how these people will be represented, because I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in motion "not a Messiah guide, but for a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as they love and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, based on the murder of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012, identified the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identified as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is no more" mative type of action "in which Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shocked this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence although she was in front of the front, because there is a life on these cruises than a black, gay woman so much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social-political atmosphere in the area called her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she mourns to a voice and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support them.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "magnitude": TV readers discuss on bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the South of the pedestrian zone spends the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme hardly leaves the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say: "it would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi]) or quite simply: "magnitude!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build on that a gallery attract more customers in the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farm market stands, in which 13 direct marketing their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will conclude with the start of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and there is no way to sit down outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmer's market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake in the land women are very happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there are also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small markthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery has come to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The new project is likely to be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping mns in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, dropments or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since it is not even a regular weekly market, it is more important to us that at least the Markthalle remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer, and is absolutely cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop stores in a shopping mall can only be rented from larger firms, because the chards are often not portable for retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and that, which is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fit for me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmer's market hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it run the ghosts bit gallery before, all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market place, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market, thank you very much - as I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost immeasurably equal - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfar and haircut, which were sent to her from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst used a 35-year sentence after having publicly made diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, their discipline in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman, and groundbreaking Dissidy, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look from Manning and could not only look like a intellectual comment on the formability of DNA data - the many wise men, as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, but already spoke openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage Act, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison it was suppressed, so very that there was only one single photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning is confident of an driver seat and carries a platinblonde wipe - with whom it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette stakes and chewing gum, extracted by the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took care of Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their incarcerated Muse were led to the letters of letters, who had several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Supported Images" from Shoili Kanungo, who would like to convert a future in which the President Chelu would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings would release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starke, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweezable way to remedy the rigid divisions he would actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, the artistic statement called Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name) is an end of the "automatic smashing, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">The opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandal of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped that the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) show how surprising, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>

<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room is a page from the above mentioned comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, like her with a Freisprechtelefon in the hand of the disciplines of the United States, like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they put your speech in cold, they have won it," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so don't wait your mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," said the artist who greet them from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get fully looking, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they are supposed to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks, of its own genomic simulators, which coves like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, as all in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2," Mannings Stature), who were written with the genetic haports with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had sent them to the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">University of Northwestern and an employee at the University of Oxford for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway to a professor at Northwestern University and one employee at the University of Oxford, who had been searched for suspects, after a man had been caught in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) warrants were issued for murder because of its alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acquisition of the National Court of Cook County.</seg>

<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the event of the event for dead, and detectives investigate the bullets as murder while the police are actively searching for the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been associate professor for microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. cubbage, vice president of the university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had been in secret now and ruled by the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter being studied by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates at this examination," said Cubism.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help us to help us with the US investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens were shocked and want to set up.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he demands the suspects to put the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have a presentation of their residence, and our efforts to localise them," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said that the police got a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza building, which had just received a mysterious tip that had happened in the apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruelly.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the optics and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="2226">Earlier, if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she will find a telephone number or e-mail to the company headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an inbreeding and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Convercent is involved, problems that were stationed in offices in cities or states, can be hidden in offices in cities or states - as discrimination, harassment or unlucely practitioner - are identified and addressed.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It's about 23 o'clock as a lot of UCLA football player on one side of the new exercise fields of the teams on the campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have gone out their tricot and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, they represent a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three-hour exercise to their final tests before they return at 6: 30 am to the water Football Center.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is for the guys the next three days a real tretmill," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the player, and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">For this reason, the first three training sessions of the UCLA at 19: 15 will start to meet the players ready-packed.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood was moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six times in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to stop doing 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal preparations for the start of Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Mora said he supports the change of the NCAA, even if they add a further point of routes of the player.</seg>

<seg id="2274">Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched that people rent a room there and then set up there to record a exercise.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze film video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-1980 a siphole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now to inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshirman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wehed.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'stretches over time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac handiewicz, Briy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2298">"this is his Daumenabprint!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And they still smell as smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect as if he himself did.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so acting with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and nearly four months lived in a castle ("To be honest:" I have given my welcome vending a little bit ") seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, to study the archives and have spent many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monographs had spent many centuries in the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with land braids, gardening and sometimes with the artists that worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received the full access in 2006, when the last one, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats told" Oh that it described it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, maps that represent what had said: "one might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all his gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to put on a wider base in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who is leaving the newly built castle to join the peasant rise of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar who appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit patrons, who hidden the family Darrell seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which smugglers Arthur Darrell, portrayed his own funeral, filled a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarg was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the masters seemed to be right to be able to make debt and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-males ensoles their debt crises, giving rich women to marry - I imagine it as a heap well looking guys before, with a talent to recruit landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its deployment in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique screb experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has got a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki behind him, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been demanded by nature again.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Oh, now I have to be done with the digested life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign launched: over 300 years old Marichapel in Rhöndorf covered</seg>
<seg id="2324">With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Mary chapel in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef started to launch its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand (Rundschau with Thursday).</seg>
<seg id="2325">Until Thursday, Mayor Otto NEUHOFF and his marketing team would like to keep Nelson Artz's logo and his slogan.</seg>
<seg id="2326">At the end of August, there should be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Grafenwerth at the end of August.</seg>
<seg id="2327">"to be nice for us.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Or?, "the makers of the promotion has been on posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel yesterday.</seg>

<seg id="2330">"but we use this measure to win your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And to make clear that some is better than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In essence, we are the firm conviction that we know as a bad Honnefer citizen around the beauty and attraction of our city very well. "</seg>
<seg id="2333">In action, it is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it means further.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (Yas) were advisable for retirement and promotions in the Offizierscope.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting took place no longer in the building of general Staff, as previously, but in the office of Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the government, the five Vice Premiers, as well as the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This was the number of civilians in the Yas in the number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The Government draws the breeders on the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were removed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed Coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 Generals and Admirducts.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen who sees Erdogan as wire-wire of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, who have been involved in the attempt at the coup attempt, will have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan was referred to as "God's gift," because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really affect the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uneasiness in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general Staff, there is concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, who manifested among others in raising the headtuban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The grandparents in the army and security forces continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan sent another 7395 government officials, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed, when Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals are formerly known as the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Thrice they took under appeal on their role as the guardians of the worldly state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan left the power of the military step by step, not least of calling on the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is targeted towards an Islamization of armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a well-known officer, who, after the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad, sought for asylum in a few years "full of extremists and salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, NATO could not leave Nato's evolution.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, there are doubts in the alliance according to the academics of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to sanitation track for race transportation</seg>
<seg id="2374">Again over the past few months over the future of the race vehicles has been fought - now it should go fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year the circuit is to be built, on which the tourist bahn will be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race of the competition, according to the Ministry of Transport, we will start construction work on the route.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is especially important for the tourism important link," declared Traffic State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the distance he applied to approximately 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the land will take 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of land, will currently be coordinated, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South-üringen railway as operators are already in the technical details about the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"so the timetable is based on vehicles and quality standards," Sühl said.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This makes the race end shuttle to be regular on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The racite shuttle is especially popular with tourists popular train connections between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past months, the course of a pilot project was tested according to whether the distance of sufficient many people is used to order it again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The circuit is also very dilapidated in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex-robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 cannot be more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex-robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, retired professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascent seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its form of nipples and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the company deliver a lot of it, and we will see it much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexporters have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon ingival that feels warm, with consciously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt its robot to his beliefs "and select everything, from the eye color of the robot through the form of nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there is still more worrying because many robots possess the "personalities" that would look like a steppe-woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexports have developed into robots using a silicon ingival.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties, which it will be appealing, for example, relapses.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapacy and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">That's what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed on conversation or can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subsistent female properties that goes on rape if you go one step on Frigid (means: resisting) Farrah is worried about most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy is a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men do not have a Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her origination and its increasing refinement show a little darker and low in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional allowance.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men of course do not think of course no sex robots, and while the FRR notice their rising popularity, they still remain in the fringe of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is leakened out of the boundary zones, in regards to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until they are the free market for these.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a period in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there has been a president in the White House, who has choked up women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid's') are not the graphic pictures, the swallowed body and the outdated eyes, but how realistic this vision appears.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim of this Sex-Robot is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their inheritance would like to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities, robots are no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate or go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or a background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything, which might interfere with the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Otherwise stated: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in terms of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human rights</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binary of the trump-era, that the political divisions, which have polarized the US electorate, have also divided families in small size.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest festival there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of cadenza.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We were all supposed to burst all of us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I consider this because my cousin, a left-oriented poet that lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family that visited New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unit can have a mighty effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone knows whom she knows, including the Republican-transformation, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by trump, but the final effect of his presidency has power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the spooky way that his Mittens won't stop any more day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a long-time long-time scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the epitome of confusion.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked out) - both in fact occur as a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be spiritual health to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussel of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass-designs on the central cylinders - all clowns are crushing and the animals turn to look full of fear on their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climiting music gives it a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés and a city disappoint: the views of high buildings will become old, the Skylines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not just meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I had to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but practice pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was alienating, while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with breast pain in the hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schnulled to his handlers, which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first dead body because of murder after a appeal of the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed steenkins in the early morning of the year 2013 by pushing them by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on her.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder, who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to put this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say, it was too dense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National prosecution authority said that they will raise the objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg</seg>
<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-tugly schools were fired from Fury and Epfenhofen for vacations and in the continuing schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students are going to school in the high school, four at the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">School director Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Biesental house in Eminenhofen on Tuesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2463">As a symbol for the school release, the 29 students of the four classes were elected under Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm, but then released into freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">For this purpose, the lower Schar introduced a musical with the title "The Eagle in the chicken yard."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Peasant Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his poultry.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a hen, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But hope of making a chicken out of him, the eagles spread on a high mountain off his wings and fled.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, the classes were three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank found a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young gockles, the cylinders, around the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stand for the integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young was different from the other young animals (chicks), but belong to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">He will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His purpose is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">They wish every fourth-tugly that he feels accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">It followed Dankeson to the colleagues, former school director Michael Müller, who once again jumps on pedagogy, and the parents represent the parents.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The Kükeness is over, the classmates Sophia Schumacher declared.</seg>
<seg id="2477">They leave their pupils after two years of course only very ungers, because it was a really great time.</seg>
<seg id="2478">Finally, they can rely on the four-klässler.</seg>
<seg id="2479">Finally, all students enroll a song of summer time and holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="2480">In this process, great joy broke out.</seg>

<seg id="2483">Two Bulgarians were detained because of illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited on television.</seg>
<seg id="2484">On the morning of 1 August in Sithonia, police arrested a group of illegal people, including the two Bulgarians.</seg>
<seg id="2485">On the same day, they were released, while currently an investigation is running.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have sharpened control of the free campen and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose, which is not responsible for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2488">Controls are continued during the entire season.</seg>
<seg id="2489">The ministry said that the court can be hanging for fine.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel vehicles: what to know those affected now</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel-summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group software have offered software updates for about 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">It is intended to improve the emission behavior of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the edited software updates are optional.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates will only apply to the vehicles," "" "" "," says Anja Smetalanine.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting has arranged the power station Federal Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers inform about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers have announced an ongoing implementation in the next few months, but not yet called exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has communicated to write any kind of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If it is due to an inspection, it will be done in their context.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long shall the conversions withdraw into a total?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smetalanine.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The connections from the manufacturer's commitment as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen voluntarily, the automakers act on the issue of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long shall the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">It could be time-consuming could be an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do motorists do that do not drive car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE does not wait for a wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably foreign manufacturers would count, so Smetalanine.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is there a massive discount of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The Ace fears that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But even in the regions where bicycles are dropping.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural area there is no value-loss for older diesel.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award</seg>
<seg id="2522">The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2523">The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become politically.</seg>
<seg id="2524">One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Ll Cool J (49) gets the first Rapper one of the coveted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">As the cultural institution announced on Thursday this year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographers in Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the award with his wife Melania.</seg>
<seg id="2529">Along with progressive TV series, the winners of Lear announced this reason to renounce participating at the Gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">The New York Times said: "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and that burdened me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will take advantage of Trump in order to make their visibility.</seg>
<seg id="2532">The Kennedy-Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.</seg>
<seg id="2533">At the earlier prizewinners, Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.</seg>
<seg id="2534">We make the city vibrant</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes to retirement in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but appropriate applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun, as it conveys in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">It reports varied, but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, we wonder that there is no application for the requirements profile so far.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is searching for an architect or building engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This is supposed to be still enough time for one of the regular work periods - even enough time.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach has been responsible for the administrative community as the subordination authority, the candidate must submit relevant connections.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city definitely.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they cannot fill this out more, the citizen would have to travel to Offenburg by Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the city is near, and it is important to him, "Wacker that tells of good operational climate as well as a good mood between the authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, based on the chipper with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we are making the city lively," it is secure on the building office and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the reshaping of the former Hukla Areas and the low-floor parking lot are encountered.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The kinda bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the state-sanitation is still subject.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will smash around 1.5 million euros alone, "when we do it right," appreciates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my followers.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">An old master space is present for a municipal master.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs's own building yard and gardener could not be reacted very flexibly.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move much," so Wacker, and the design of green plants will often commend with citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is standing under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye to do what is clean," if new buildings are approved, emphasizes the scheid city builder.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The Stadtbaumeister has high responsibility anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is builder, "at the end it runs all over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved with Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, his successor remains long, Wacker: "we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because continuity is not only important for a good environment, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you like Roland Wacker, the city of Haslach should provide a closed studies as a diplomat or Bachelor with the architecture of architecture and have a good knowledge of expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning.</seg>
<seg id="2564">Building planning, construction and civil engineering, construction planning, business planning, urban recitals, urban factory building with building yard and municipal estate, as well as the sub-building authority, including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike on lines are thrown: southern railroad closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike from the train to the Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so strongly damaged, that the end-up freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators are out of two male lines and looking for the night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Close to the crime scene were a rosaroter escalator and a bike rider had been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that goes far beyond a Lausitz region," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The or the perpetrators had brought itself into great danger, even at risk of train.</seg>
<seg id="2572">Besides the damage to the Lok and the plant, as well as the delay-minute drive and the costs for rail transport could also be added to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">For a total of "considerable" sum, the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damages were fixed on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south route could be led without Disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">There were almost ten minders of concerts in the morning, two of them see remote traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains failed, but they had delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to the ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch had to be replaced about 200 m lines.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation) to lint</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bladder, recurring or bloody accidents, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are normally taken to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins which contributes to the essential amino acid which promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hide in food, not into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are imable to dissolve inflammation, are balanced by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body, without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is inclined towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a sort of tolerance by immunity occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its entrails.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbious, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan which had mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan varied diet tolerant, less flammable intestinal milieus if the same system is spinning in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study wers had such cells, but another group of the same stem, which was separated from the same way that had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspects that the difference with the intestinal microbial of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The number of mice were DNA sequenced, and were found six bacterial species, which were present in mice with immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were drawn up in a sterilen environment so that they were missing a intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria began to grow on the immune system, the researchers abandoned L. reuteri in a liquid and then overled small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolism, known as the Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells declined by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant competitive cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal traps.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop cells in people like mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "Genius"</seg>
<seg id="2605">Manchester United has signed with Nemanja Matic a "Genius" that Jose Mourinho believes that the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria in Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The 40 million pounds subtitle of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Cup for Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impressive in the holder role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic was excluded from the preparation-Asia tour of the Blues and finished only 45 minutes, which Mourinho refused to improve the beginning of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him sooner than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic started Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho is his start-XI for the beginning of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent revealed that Mourinho had another three new commitment, but he insisted that the club has already done a "fantastic job," three of its four senior new commitment to meet.</seg>
<seg id="2612">"three of four to get, thank you for the association," he added.</seg>
<seg id="2613">"I will be happier if they get four of four, but they have given great effort."</seg>

<seg id="2615">The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliners in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington's State, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dreamliners on the USA, which are several thousand kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">On the radar sensor, the form of a Dreamliners was to be.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The whole thing was a lasting test for new engines.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Boeing had already made such advertising earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2622">New civil service for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind revolves around: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD boss, S & D leader of Prime Minister always remained with certain concern after Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only there is no noise from the party's party, just no antiwind from the federal government - so the most important desire of the electoral struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has been leading the party, has fundamentally changed.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus are watching the events in the SPD-regated regional capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Mr Schulz has been given since the beginning of the year, it wouldn't be described with the headwinds.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were civil surcharges.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal government is a generic signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red-Green is simply not reliable," said CDU-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial office in Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising leader of a green parliament has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the country code, his red-green coalition lost their one-vote majority to the Opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green-President Michael Kellner, the Green Party leader Michael Kellner was invited to return to their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The tread to the CDU means a clear degradation of voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Tjackets must immediately return their mandate, "said the Federal Chancellor and electoral campaign of the Green Party network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"it must not be true," he sighed a SPD election campaign, when the new Hiobsbotship party was reached on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD-President of Lower Saxony, stands according to the remains of the green deputies Elke Twest to the CDU without its own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Misers started an unexpected defeat at the Saarland's election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, the comrades were delighted.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to the State elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then - and indeed everything was much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to swaiter, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party until smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">So the comrades fell again in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when she had made new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next deep.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD-Landeschef, lost his Nimbus at that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie during his town burnt.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he had so much wrong in crisis communications, which one can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz fights for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the VW-gas affaires and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister already stood in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Mixes were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or maybe, because, because of the past few weeks, Weil always tried again to set accents in the league.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The existence of the former Mayor of Hannover to build his power in Berlin, was also not hidden in the environment by Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him, because they spoke of a stabilisation of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In doing so, because of the partisan, the Anglo-Saxon Green is basically no fault.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz certainly not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">Sometimes, comrades therefore strive to keep its own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their wrath is focused on the green, and here especially on the revolting parliamentarians in Twest.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and Democratiestheses such as Mrs. Tjackets on their own carrients on the interests of all the others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party tines in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Ms. Twest is not elected for its person as direct candidature, but on the regional list of the Anglo-Saxon Green Party, so the Anglo-Saxon parliamentarians on.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains a "innocent maneuver."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voters before four years ago it was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil appointed Minister-President," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a leading candidate to the Bundestag election to the RND.</seg>

<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote the inner development, and not just connect new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, we received the information from the governing government Karlsruhe, that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount totalling 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 Euros from the country, the rest of the community sensory.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a renovation work now?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to investigate so Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role, whether in the planned area at all interest arise, to sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If there could be, the area limits could then move again again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the basement, the Federation presented the Federation of the Federation Program "Social City," in which the sanations would then be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalization of internal cities, improving the residential and working conditions, preserving and expansion of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would have objective, that is, per plot, is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval period for funding has been running since January 1, 2017, until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September of this year, however, the stock intake should only be carried out, as part of those involved in the sanitation area involved a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the spotlight will be made possible to begin with the restoration in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann said that each commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about to evaluate the urbanisation of abuse, and to decide when sanitates and in which scope.</seg>
<seg id="2695">It will then be entered for the respective property also a sanitation gradk in the base book.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again to sensing again and make a picture of the position, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed, a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore there will be questionnaires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow Questionnaire is the "building and plot of land" with which it works among other things to build the structural condition and restoration views.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey Questionnaire, the "household and housing," data can be made up to size, distribution and residents of a residential space.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "operating bow" is only to fill in the building of business rooms.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, to note, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">Moreover, rebuilding measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funding for the "Windmill principle" - who comes first comes first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">One could not reserve funding for later "reserve."</seg>

<seg id="2714">The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event which highlights the American production in the last month will cost taxpayers according to the data of the military that were left to the TIME magazine, up to 24.000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American Bauprogrammes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter was exhibited in Connecticut, alongside a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I only wanted you to be aware because it is an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to its superiors, the Deputy Navy commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o'clock in the morning to the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long stayed until the Lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the event, the original aviation crew was during the helicopter while security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Out of the articles provided by the TIME were not clear, whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets show that HMX-1 was asked whether the event could violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we introduced, was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"it sounds as if you are closed," the deputy commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and propagated efforts to constrain the government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, which is known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">President are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But using only for a photo surgery, it is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Trump resulted in an investigation as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, Taxiservices, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is thrilled with the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials," said the vice-chair of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to expose the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 led 58 exercise through the White House.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The flight for the "Made in America" event was one of the training requirements for the month, said an official.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopters also flew 11 hours a day for "non-presidential support commissions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers were not the burden for any of the other props who were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved, to put the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budgeted drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundentarifen of the US Ministry of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD certificate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hours.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the regional base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates, is highly misleading," said Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, revenue sets for DoD does not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract statements.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At this time, the former press prepress of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things which are produced in America," said Spicer.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security, and I go out that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked.</seg>
<seg id="2754">It is, of course, reasonably priced. "</seg>
<seg id="2755">It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire engine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House, Trump and representatives of Sikorsky talked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very good," said the President, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2892">Christian Weissenator, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after publication from the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much, if Müller and Ratzinger would last for its deepest regret or its then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Chancellor, "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the reporting on violence with "two different levels."</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the handles in Regensburg, no one knew that it would have to be "shameful and shameful deeds," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habits, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and preparing the public opinion to keep that for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go on the church and this is a second fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, it pointed out that in her youth "beats had been a normal pedagogical means" to be finished with young children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use present standards in past decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse cases often, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the reminder band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he considers the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg, with the clarification of attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were made sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s. "victims of attacked, 67 Domsparrows are sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it's said to Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can hold on that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for the students could also be cut off at high levels.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other restrictions, many of the victims were estimated to estimate the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Eemann, in the interview, Eemann, said the final report to the misfortune scandal at the Georg Ratzinger district of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "incidents of violence on protective foes at the Regensburger Domspatzen" exists a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift up many students "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, it appears as choleriker and perfectionist, which has become more tangible when an Domspatz did not have a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you are doing the effort and reads the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you should rather ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger has to be found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of Mittal or fellow-serenity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The role of violence at the Pre-school took place outside of its work sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can do it if necessary, too late or first clarifications do not have taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domestic Product, on which he worked, was experienced by practically all those surveyed - as literally - "salvation," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger is a very excellent witness, describes it as a "warm herently," "competent," and "understandable," "competent," and "comprehensible teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and candy and" always surrounded by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about his perfectism and its high emotional quality, which also led to Wutauseres.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't only cast them with chairs and put the keyring on the ground, but also earnestly guys distributed to hair or ears, he already regretted, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced that in a worldly school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, the horrible sexual abuse and violence on the school, are liberally Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There they wonder whether it is not more with its popularity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just stormed him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope there are many, who never understood it, still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report gives Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the context of the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also publishes any transaction or complicity in terms of sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they have not been concerned with parents and siblings, certainly not a choral leader, but he certainly would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How to evaluate the Domsparrow students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see no case in which he counted (Georg Ratzinger) who would have had his final findings and could stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for real absurd, to assume that it is expected to be more urgent and clearer, or rather opened, as opposed to their parents, interventions, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">This is how the report comes to the very clear result: "that in advance, students and / or their surroundings were confidential, could not be confirmed in the scope of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempt from every contributor to each other.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be accused of having to be prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradicted crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "violence to eat" at the Regensburger Domsparatzen was to read.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused in the report "directions."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and blended to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that's exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of domites, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we once again say other preferences.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report provided incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of sac teachers have been properly chaired and malicially, all took place at the Pre-School in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to reigns.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boy first to face, as they were already on the domestial school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On what was the most important witnesses, the subject "Pre-school" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise-states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Dommob grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not sac violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims also estimated the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">This is how the accusation remains too fishly.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the conditions on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school, which he had not appeared and responsible, (such as the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then it was only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Fired Georg Ratzinger on the conditions consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this point, it indicates that in the pre-school, the inspector continued to practice. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in the face of negatively negative health insurance, it recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity, as testers, had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took part in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows about us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also hard to estimate, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the allowable border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the inspectorate was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to use today's educational standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we speak historians from the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger, past today's moral measure.</seg>
<seg id="2975">He is quite right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is, of course, not for sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence to innocent children's parents, that is already well beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all awful and I'm glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplines and punishment, so earnecrows and to pull the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also has kept stripped.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his rainy season, Georg Ratzinger went to the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüfer also came to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domsparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't miss any way that he was a stringent regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said once again: without these perfection, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world leaders, true culture ambassador Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone one does not make a great singer and have no great success in any success, right in the area, yet discipline, passion and self-overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man did you experience Georg Ratzinger on the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well met and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and heart of good people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'll get a regular basis with how many former Domspikes still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his release, visit him - he is almost blind - and how to treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, so clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domites are thankful to him today that he enriched her life and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vicious teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to whom they still see and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: everything you need to do, are educational methods that were at the time at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overmet this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a more prominent brother to make a medial sin-corn.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, only very obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now there would be a 93-year-old man who had acquired large merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany no one would probably know the Regensburger Domsparrows to finally leave peace.</seg>
