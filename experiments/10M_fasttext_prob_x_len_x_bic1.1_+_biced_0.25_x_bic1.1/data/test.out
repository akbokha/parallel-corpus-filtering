Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always put into drawers
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston is not always perfect or successful .
that in an interview , the Hollywood star has now made un@@ intenti@@ onally clear .
&quot; I will always be loaded into drawers or ref@@ resh from the outside Label , who usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself did not have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather schn@@ apps . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that they are considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mopolit@@ an . &quot;
the actress sp@@ ends her time at home , pre @-@ TV with lo@@ cker@@ le D@@ utt and Mexican food , is it in the magazine .

gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er was looking for a little variety with some colleagues and a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes the horses remin@@ ded their holiday , they pursued fast gal@@ lop in the fast gal@@ lop at home .
one kilometer at this pace , I have dre@@ ad@@ ful .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and that ended the riding career then again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best golf course was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t swear to a photo .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid delivered the man out of An@@ hausen in a small gala as part of a small gala .
at awards there is no lack of symp@@ a@@ thetic sport@@ s@@ men .
former federal secretary , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions tour players of the year ...
even the British Queen caught him already .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award is very much , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; because it will not only be awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er has been promoting the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way .
with 15 more outstanding athletes , the double US master champ@@ ions won the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the winners of the winners belong to Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ck and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Spring@@ field Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the pal@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports events were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ate company emigrated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential compet@@ itor are however with tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to be rather small in doubt and warns against such as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy and regulate the death , he says .
by contrast , he would have been completely different , claims tr@@ ump .
he will drive regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a wide @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies .
Clinton says : the state has certain duties to meet , he has made of dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost .
the democratic candidate announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so there could be more internal discussions on tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are obvious .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive coal on the USA again .
oil transport should also be possible in far protected areas to announce the Parisian climate agreement .
Clinton wants to expand renewable energies with their investment program , saying : &quot; a country will create the clean energy and will create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ de trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both but not want to is@@ olate the United States from international trade - rather than just US jobs .
they should then be paid better , for example Clinton calls .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to do , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to discharge the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics obey him , so that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , which at least of the wealthy wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday life .
when arriving in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women sitting .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has laid her small son in the arm .
he gu@@ arding with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table plate .
until they notice that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles and kissed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the division &apos;s managing director of Con@@ tr@@ bs , a carrier for social help in Bavaria , and among other things , with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
they live in the Munich North , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all@@ u@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ tr@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Day .
it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not available - even as visitors .
the exception is a wax before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because they are torture or death , or because their families are sending them as hopes for Europe , &quot; she tells .
in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many are taking away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , it continues .
&quot; for example , the tu@@ g for a bottle of water demand a sexual action , no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe once they are anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here , the women in refugee camps were often regarded as min@@ der@@ y and worst mis@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the north of the Munich , are trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women have been so familiar , that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot;
since they often do not need to help , there is more accommodation only for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they are using a similar project like in Munich in its condition , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something like the governments in accomod@@ ations of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated from being separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ press of the government .
in the Bavaria , sub@@ - and middle @-@ fran@@ ken areas there are some shared floors or own houses only for women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the committee &quot; Rights of women and equality of the sexes &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
in a study published by the Committee , it means : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or men are missing together , men and women can be accommod@@ ated , it may come to - persistent - violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separately accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
how much the women sense this protective needs , you can read on And@@ res , which there is on the house in Munich .
&quot; we &apos;ve been talking about that there is a long qu@@ eue , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants st@@ alls : demands on new workers measures
the assistant of the assist@@ ants called their union members to appro@@ ve new workers in disp@@ utes with their disp@@ utes in terms of a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures from the beginning of September .
J@@ DC told that there would be ministers to worry about the concerns about the contract .
in July , Assist@@ enz@@ ologists and medical inst@@ ig@@ ents have agreed to be agreed upon the re@@ jection of a contract with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who have voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was posted on Twitter on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court announced that the government would be quite calm on problems , which led to the contract that the contract was rejected .
she said , &quot; In view of what has the J@@ DC Board tuned to completely reject the proposed new contract and concerns official new negotiations for all E@@ states . &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board appointed a formal motion for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of escal@@ ating work , which begins at the beginning of September .
disp@@ utes listed that assist@@ ants took six times this year , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the election of the agreed contra@@ ctual conditions , had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions who were still held in front of the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical inst@@ ances that the contract should be adv@@ anta@@ geous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hun@@ t said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors were forced into force in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to announce an official end of the eight months in the words of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation most .
there was the towel , yes .
but Put@@ ting sm@@ iles worked very nar@@ row@@ ly and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for its rest@@ rained conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke of his &quot; beloved friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved so that it would never happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that the head of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mention what he mentioned in his entry points : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ asted .
Putin told Putin and accused Ankara to appeal Russia into his back .
the sur@@ passing was even larger , since it was committed by a good friend .
the Vet@@ r@@ w will be hard to rebuild , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the government @-@ controlled media launched a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time , the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ologies , he wanted to listen .
Russia could book a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of an ar@@ mist@@ ice are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends that he can get after finishing last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of his amber .
the terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count towards a late @-@ seasonal an@@ thro@@ es of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week projected the state @-@ TV cheaper fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , since its reaction to the attempted power supply was considered a weak response .
to this end , the persi@@ sting res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the ear@@ nest on it is to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian state leader won a bonus in Ankara with security for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected state organs .
this is true for Moscow , a matter of self @-@ understanding , which even has a profound fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace allowed Russia and Turkey , one , as it described me an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that stum@@ bled from the west and are not treated so badly .
nonetheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey assist .
it may be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first call to the press conference , both pre@@ sidents were saying that they didn &apos;t want to stri@@ ve the topic once .
the President of Turkey had intenti@@ onally respon@@ ding to a question about its differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise them .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open en@@ sel@@ ections - and given the potential for a complete dis@@ aster than the NATO member Turkey ra@@ p the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads are talking at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland Local of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s head office , R@@ BS will have to be reduced to a back@@ office role model .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself as she had almost collapsed and saved eight years ago .
in this period brand new brand &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end users .
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds on Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , head office and stock ex@@ changes to Nat@@ West change .
Ul@@ ster Bank &apos;s brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become one of our investors , as well as the brand , under which our employees will be busy , as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has been a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue a global goals , but pursue local targets .
any of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these stamps with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not be continued its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of brands , for how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the President of Staff .
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical when we said that we will be a great bank for our clients and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on client needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come .

Russia &apos;s Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin released unexpected his Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the most close confidence of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport affairs .
in a position of Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is that Putin without stating reasons &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was substitute for Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
1972 in Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he made his graduation at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s embassy .
on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it &apos;s ( in Russian ) that he was later log @-@ chief and head of directors of the gover@@ ning probe .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state leader in terms of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian television station on Friday that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V asked that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V have asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the ridic@@ ulous faces ?
this step was mysteri@@ ously made in Moscow .
Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the most closely trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the chief of Staff has re@@ signed on his own request .
but despite the smile of smile for cameras , here are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as potential president once again to lead the Russian environment policy - joined large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin that are cited on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said , &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said &quot; it is true that I asked you to do this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ying for four years to trust .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ bility Service ( FS@@ B ) , which was appointed to the K@@ GB , was named IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people , most of whom he confi@@ ded .
once was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could have been President of Russia after Put@@ ting the second term of President of Russia , as a third term in Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , seam@@ less allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .

engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of Queens@@ bor@@ dered Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four se@@ ams of the &quot; cover blo@@ wers , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 scra@@ pers .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion co@@ stly project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of Queens@@ bor@@ ns .
we are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used for this part of the bridge alone .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sh@@ utter between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate work that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the pass .
in total , almost 79 % of the total br@@ ück@@ cks on their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks get a concrete kiss to the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor , said : &quot; the first closure provides a considerable milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of future @-@ proof high @-@ quality and civil engineering represents .
after the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the North tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very he@@ ats .
massi@@ vely , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % upwards .
he@@ ats , because the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were tiny - on each side it was just a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive &quot;
three men have not yet to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat from the an@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat was moving out of their own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and placed the worst before , &quot; said the ladder of the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones &apos; rescue station .
&quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat from their operating range until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a ground without the life@@ jacket .
they came all aboard the dri@@ fting boots and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been injured and still alive .
the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , this dissolved the boat from the person by the person sharing the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened today over those men .
seriously wounded - man turns on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police ha@@ sted yesterday , the 50 year old had gotten the keys to the apartment to get his personal things .

when the two women once again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and took his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors have to be invested stronger in the duty of the future .
how does one respon@@ ds to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; manual concept living &quot; for the next plan .
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
SPD Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; we are with the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas in the future must be 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the inventory .
however , the big issue in the town hall was , however , Brat@@ man : &quot; how do you want to build investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new Municipal Building for residential construction programme , which will cost millions and has to be financed , should provide for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , the Brat@@ man : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors a few regulations as possible .
the Left aims to pay hard@@ ships for investors .
regardless of this , Brat@@ man , ba@@ e a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the manual concept is implemented , that will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will receive skilled workers .
yet the program does not work completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how does one compar@@ es the loss of further around 1300 favorable flats , whose promotion is going to run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning policy speech in Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
furthermore , apartments would have to be thought again to get back into the price .
this is possible in the western town .
one fell the problem for a blow .
because in the western town run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this will not be the owner , the residential property societies .
because the number of social housing in the west city is dra@@ stically increased , one removes the target of the so @-@ called passage .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be still movement in discussion .
S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a vast majority , the CDU should have to go into the ship . &quot;
the owners have been concentr@@ ating on more buildings for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and child do not want to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , in the last decade of many compl@@ ains .
at Pok@@ emon Go , people go to get people from the sofa and get more active .
the screen at the beginning was at the beginning of the TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not open to each other .
I go to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that is based on the characters that were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later a drawing series , playing cards , and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , interest sank in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was moved through the massive demand , which over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; can be captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , the W@@ ahn joined and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase of steps that sets the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35.000 users , told the Washington Post that within two days after launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes train , from 45 percent to 53 per cent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people would like to take &quot; themselves 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day actively to be &quot; beat on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look good .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can &apos;t be over@@ rated .
those who regularly drives sports , reduces its opportunities to ill cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making it fun .
three pillars of health - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ rical games , which must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run for a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphones apps like Fit@@ bit earlier were able to follow our activity , they did not use any reason to play sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with the time .
however , due to poker success , there will be more games which will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will be combined in the real world and will be able to help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the hy@@ pe .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now Olympic champion finally arrived .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the majority voting and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five , &quot; Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ist gains in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , on the pig bal@@ ken during the single campaign of women in the art of Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a majority title and a total of the fifth , while they make their reputation to be the best of their generation , or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey had an end .
this success shows them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated her sport in the last three years - including 10 gold medals , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , who told us a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that she said &quot; the best thing that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was a final examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after they have won gold and silver in the single combined events of women in the Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday while she retired on the farewell party of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although it insi@@ sted on the top , during their long departure to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which include their typical tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym hall , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition competition , a winning series that will be so long as it wishes .
even if the mu@@ cos@@ ina led by two turns lightly , the picture was dec@@ eit@@ ed .
Swe@@ des and Bo@@ ots - in which Bil@@ es won the world championship title - l@@ ur@@ king .
they returned again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig &apos;s bal@@ ken and set another on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man h@@ ugs her gently as she expected her final - a pure form@@ ality - and tears at Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she described once in their collection book , to reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille went into a low level of Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old female servant who is called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; an advantage over the Americans .
after their practice , they threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doub@@ tful .
as regards image , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds of the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in series production by car in the car .
according to the police report published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of series by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a trip , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a pal@@ mate , while he stood at the passenger side of the car , and fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder could not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ ackers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of an adult victims .
the polic@@ eman from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ators to become a close look , if it is connected with four previous attacks .
a total of 7 attacks were killed and two more injured in h@@ isp@@ anic residential neighbor@@ hoods in nine attacks .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; distributed Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed because of its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died out on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and to listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that went on an empty Pick@@ up truck to half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the series production .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves his singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the fe@@ west of his aging has Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , which knew not his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home first , my first thought was I create it .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let myself leave .
what is not true at all -- of course you settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her became aware that Edmund they can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they beat him institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with a help @-@ help .
Edmund was neither sitting till his third year of life neither sitting cro@@ oked , and he still cannot speak .
but it is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the pron@@ unci@@ ation that Edmund for &quot; Please give me a little bit before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a string , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical drawing language -- it says . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic as at Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds us of the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I have not wondered after the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives occasion to rescue life in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday . it is expected to last Saturday with more rain .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Al@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large floods after extreme rain , reported the National Weather Service .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards told that state officials are standing in constant contact with the local authorities and had already been on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Board , divided the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that only the community of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for wide parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service provided that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in the South of Alabama , a flood early warning system was used , while in the area Mobile , it was still ra@@ ining .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will reach a record level of all probability after the weekend .
the Met@@ rics ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could recover many houses in the a@@ or@@ tic areas near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a stream @-@ off flood in Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger since they are flowing only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Tick@@ et@@ w river , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest stand on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams also zu@@ res people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among those who were saved by glo@@ om on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , is strong rise overnight .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , warned him .
&quot; we are awake , and the water abo@@ red and abo@@ unding in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife , Hans@@ ford said she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency kers had saved all three into a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood has spread themselves rapidly , as it continued to rain heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers close to Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was severely damaged by the rainfall since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road re@@ vo@@ ws the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and ped@@ agog@@ ue in five school sources .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ated houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 survived houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to host the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the village Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents to help them that hope to keep the water from their houses and stores .
&quot; the last great flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems a similar incident .
in W@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison &apos;s Count@@ ys said that it continues on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses have been reported to be reported on Thursday , but on Friday not yet reported .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; le@@ ased out of balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several s@@ uss@@ ers , including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was le@@ ased out of balls , &quot; divided his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ s@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter , that it is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people visited the town in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is found in a critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police are precisely determined whether one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that apparently there seems to be a cross fire between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ y for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , ski@@ pped the tat@@ too .
it seems that there has been clearly a constant battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , pul@@ ses were located .
in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters that were very active , &quot; divided police viol@@ inist Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several homes and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently checked , according to reports , the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross @-@ label on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lane .
it re@@ covers and the police are looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I found myself under the Frauen@@ i@@ am@@ ship at the gym@@ nasium and that from more than a reason .
first of all , I have been at any Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three tower houses , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie , &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired for many young girls other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lic@@ in is complete , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the United States .
it has consolidated black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport art .
in the past four years the number one was among the female Tur@@ ner@@ ves a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising debut in America and in America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they expected unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ ma@@ stic rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold for women with an individual prize event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of these sports type , but so you can &apos;t see gy@@ ms in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tournaments in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and Turner first join in private Turn@@ halle that are maintained by parents , which will cost for training , educational , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these verses the Turner will get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ er of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the Tur@@ nen .
we have to make the churches with countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ performance and easily accessible turn@@ outs .
I founded my turn@@ out of 20 years .
in my events we offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer a high @-@ quality gym@@ nasium who make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport art and benefit .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care for the tower and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass motivated her as many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organise further strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hoped to finish the contro@@ versy over the changes made by the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,000 assist@@ ants who are tuned for a vote , refused him .
in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to implement the contract and said that the N@@ HS would have allowed itself to be harmful to a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to people and patients .
the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , the changes to night and weekly work to improve maintenance times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A commis@@ sions for Assist@@ enti@@ sts shared last night in a message with : &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ ologists have pre@@ heat the proposed contract to how serious concerns , in particular that it will be led to the current staff crisis and to treat all the doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts from the BM@@ A solution to resol@@ ving disp@@ utes by talks with the government on the contradic@@ tions and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ an@@ es@@ thetic silence .
this happened to a word that Jeremy Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door would always offer free .
&quot; Jeremy Hun@@ t must act now to raise the vibration and talk to the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , so the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to carry out more labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 sched@@ ules , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant doctors on the stri@@ kers follow @-@ up cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the contro@@ versy over the changes made by a adoption of the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants which will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures reach nothing of the only little but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients , care and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months we talked to the assistance of the assistance of Assi@@ stance , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries , the concerns expressed in terms of pre@@ m@@ ity and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers trusted that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as brie@@ fing , flexibility in training , training plans , training and gender equality in medicine - a sign for that , how serious it is the employer that Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness helps election campaign in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed from the office last year due to corruption in the office of corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to that widespread election was wi@@ red in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today .
the former Minister of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber , evidence of election abuse due to &quot; survival concerning Eth@@ nic@@ ities and Religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now a anti @-@ corruption sc@@ ary , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off def@@ aults outside of electoral cabin to protect voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to their identity in order to prove their identity .
currently , a voters must call only his name and address .
the report suggests , not remove ink on the finger of a person if they leave their voting voice to prevent someone twice .
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial crisis culture that comes to protect , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by Do@@ wning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special report decided that the am@@ ig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be to be corrupt after a lit@@ an@@ ei and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he would have had his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ant obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either desper@@ ate or the consequence of a replica , where one person cho@@ oses someone other .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud all over the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent envelope , in which older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their election .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the fo@@ w@@ ls of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members was exercised by some ethnic minority groups , especially women and young people to vote in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ographic or ban@@ gi@@ ous background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have such a behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; beliefs concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , drawn from Ther@@ esa May , also requires tou@@ g@@ her registration checks to prevent the election directory for immigration and social security purposes .
consider the options , elec@@ tors before the choice after your identification .
not remove ink on the finger of a person once they gave their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure that it is optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic mail @-@ selection .
ban that political activists process complete letter and envel@@ opes from the elections .
the police give the power to al@@ locate lock stations .
an amendment to the Prosec@@ ution of the People Act ( 1983 ) is reli@@ eved of an indictment due to the re@@ pres@@ sive of the People Act 1983 .
photograph@@ ing on election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the workout , to ensure that the employees rule the rule , that voters do alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; ast@@ oun@@ ding &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the election court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his representative for the corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said .
due to a number of reasons for reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the act@@ less &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the Rath@@ geber . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , yet the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spreading of election and lead of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to reverse with armed rap@@ es .
regardless of whether you turn from the front or rear , this video will show you how you turn around the s@@ ke@@ wer for your pre@@ dat@@ ors .
if you turn out from behind , then you should turn to the next , so that you can see your att@@ ackers and give them out of the Line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon from your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free ell@@ bow .
then hit him with the knees into the ser@@ ver@@ ste and turn , while the att@@ ackers with pain has collapsed , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backward , while they arrange the weapon upon him .
when att@@ ackers are moving forward , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun , seize the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ ackers cannot shoot .
put the weight onto the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving back and raise the weapon upon him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what Miz@@ ra@@ chi does .
but remember that it is with a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est , your money - as long as you have no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ ender Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex in a serious test by re@@ jec@@ ting some of the dirty and most severe locations of Europe .
the host and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk shot his course on a Euro notes , a ra@@ iling of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system .
in front of any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer , to show and to show us what he will let .
but the experiment made under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing of a dr@@ yers which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely imper@@ vious , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of formulation and its own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he re@@ jects , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known for this to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations up to washing up washing machines of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film , he said : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health affects and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge water . &quot;
in the film he was justified in his call .
the only thing he de@@ posed , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test scre@@ ed showed a L@@ umin@@ ometric range of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometric increased hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their L@@ umin@@ ometric increased over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
in the film , he says , &quot; This comes the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;ll do nothing here , because it is inside ek@@ el@@ ly here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company will equi@@ p Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something fascinating to look at the time and also explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we brought crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , when he had tasted some of the things I have asked him , such as the Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , to attract them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on movie . &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of respondents associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ging Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a gay family left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ging in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown on a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were removed from their estate , sho@@ cked employees of the property co@@ operative took place in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were brought to cla@@ p holes , wooden boards , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family were moved , and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said she fears that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the opinion that people don &apos;t need to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in time in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had joined the family , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug trade and excessive scre@@ ams , scattered and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , received an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior in June .
in some areas of the house , which will be demolished under circumstances , ancient tr@@ ash was found
there were tra@@ pped in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden washers
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and the police regularly had to call on the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner a week for@@ ci@@ bly from the estate after she gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily .
the del@@ og@@ ging were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors , who said that their lives was made to hell .
one said , &quot; They have revol@@ ved around anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here , are incredible .
&quot; today we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager from Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would like to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
rub@@ b@@ ish and ancient toys were brought down on the long @-@ conscious side of the municipality .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants say to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , since a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered .
that was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely terrible and their deeds had to look terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community that have gra@@ ce@@ ful to us and have made us the information we have done .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate to some neighbours , and con@@ veys the message that ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .

Donald Tr@@ ump immer@@ ses &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative federal states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the most significant and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ on@@ aire collec@@ tively expressed such thing concerns such as correspondence reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals in his own Republican camp , the doubts still grow to his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; Tr@@ ump said before evangel@@ icals , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
wrong reports are wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media .
Republican High @-@ bur@@ gers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ er &apos;s sur@@ vey@@ ance from June to June were Tr@@ ump and his conc@@ essions in the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutions see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Republican candidate in the federal state .
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia apply .
in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump said to the question how he wants to stop Clin@@ t &apos;s rise again : &quot; the same as I made it so far . &quot;
and swe@@ ep behind : this will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he will do nothing else than &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if it was not rich for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , Tr@@ ump must have threatened to handle funds for the support of its electoral campaign , it should be able to present any better environment values .
instead of its wool , the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can take stronger among the arms .
Olympia : three sc@@ am fraud at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IOC wants to establish a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission to the fall .
Ken@@ ia athletes are threatened with the Rio de Janeiro Olympics after the second d@@ oping affair .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee divided into action immediately to establish a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission in order to investigate the event .
a Ken@@ ian@@ ischer function@@ ary had informed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village had given a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this is reported by the Ken@@ yan team director of the D@@ oping @-@ Controll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has been searching for information on the event to provide own research , shared by an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was named in an IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone towards the d@@ oping control station and did as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ ias chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athletes , who stood on the list for training checks of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics Leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he must have informed against cash payments in his country over upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he must be arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation since the IOC after numerous d@@ oping cou@@ ps .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls before the Rio Olympics , this suggests that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into vision .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exercised a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law passed a few weeks before the Olympia Beg@@ inning .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya received from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD has always been res@@ oun@@ cing that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ro@@ gs .
the IOC member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had taught them in the Russian ath@@ le@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this sport , surface area and systematically mo@@ ist .
Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer play .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ einer masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic , filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls her mist@@ ress with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because they &apos;re un@@ doing musi@@ cally !
and then Mari@@ as &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I was a pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I was a pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course na@@ ive , and very passionate .
&quot; she resem@@ bles my Italian character that I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise to the opera singer : Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor for us to work with her .
it is an enormous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is as an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
today we took the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
these are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass repression
&quot; whoever does not fit and is engaged to Erdo@@ gan , &quot; says the Pra@@ y of the G@@ ülen @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish congregation in Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seeking to escape from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the presi@@ ding @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard procedure of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish congregation of Germany expects a mass strike to Germany .
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection agents from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continued to fight the minority and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already moved to Kurdish high bur@@ sts in the years ago , 500,000 Kurds are on the run within Turkey .
after the deser@@ ted put@@ sch , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added .
many will start ane@@ w in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Association of Defence compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ische cities .
thus , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exp@@ iry of the Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were era@@ dicated in the past hundred years or exp@@ elled , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member .
the President demanded that the government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany there &apos;s a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of G@@ ülen movement is also the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire @-@ market as G@@ ülen trailer is destroyed teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the G@@ ülen @-@ near foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already submitted the biggest group of political persecution recognised in Germany .
at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people have been entitled to almost 29 per cent of all and recognized today ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not those who bra@@ i@@ ded before war , poverty or am@@ el@@ essness .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it we@@ ars &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get nothing of the summer campaign together - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for so far as to date , it is not so far : summer holidays , heat and day@@ spring combat - which bit@@ es itself .
the locals who are convinced by the sel@@ f@@ ists are on holiday .
most of the most holi@@ day@@ makers , who are in the country , are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals who can &apos;t choose the country day .
these are practical problems : in the holidays , the hel@@ pers are hanging up , distribut@@ ing posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and out at the end of the voices , just to cast iron .
up to 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to rise again almost by the people over the people .
the hot phase when you can tell at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , has to fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ing .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his major posters .
he travels across the land , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ ises a little with the people , as it did already be legendary . Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
otherwise , sailors got cold feet and is ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel bl@@ unt the guilt of Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We are creating this &quot; has accelerated the rise of sp@@ op@@ o@@ ists , which is likely to cost him a beautiful office now .
the CDU with its top candidate , Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make the wrong time at the right place campaign .
she was invited twice in Angela Merkel twice , Angela Merkel is in the north east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the North @-@ East CDU reli@@ ed largely on market conditions and shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ ons .
this , so co@@ ca@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
the Union has also noticed that on the country the base is crum@@ bled that they must be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are just like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the se@@ back of the country hardly exists .
however , the Council of the CDU campaign Kok@@ ert to his co @-@ dispute is also self @-@ de@@ fle@@ ction : &quot; you must go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign campaign .
in the p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group was last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just close to the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD still had won 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will give the jump into the country day .
they make holidays in need of modern virtu@@ e and put their electoral struggle on the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; call the National Chair Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green campaigns give to track c@@ ens@@ orship for local voice carriers among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , kur@@ ted just with a house@@ boat by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ nia lakes and it also finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guest houses suffer from blocking

for those responsible for the construction work , beginning at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning , and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is enth@@ al@@ able praise .
&quot; they have done everything pretty much , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells about the jet gas station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to south end at the weekends until the end of October will be all ready .
the resolution is also praised for the construction of persons , such as it comes to the establishment of heating drives .
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the pl@@ ung@@ ing of Asp@@ erg@@ strasse was lifted up in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg are relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
citizens can now run from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the so@@ jour@@ n traffic by the place seems to be back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ e@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shots were seeking and rather their Nav@@ i confi@@ ded as the sign@@ age .
what led to that , some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ked .
as the speed lim@@ bs have not been observed , the congregation demanded the knives from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there was considerable injuries , &quot; says King , who himself was able to feel very much about the situation .
there have been two to three per minute .
the high @-@ speed free@@ wheel was on the pace of 77 km / h in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it was now cal@@ mer .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
in the cards , business@@ men are not willing to look .
however , that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to them in revenues , everybody asks you to look through .
however , some more and some people are affected .
those who have to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; have less to do so for other companies , for which the restructuring has hardly any consequences .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no less decline , &quot; but also dre@@ aming that of course , &quot; the drive is missing . &quot;
the Local along the street are the strongest farms .
J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly known crown , finds clear words .
that is already threatening .
not just him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
they were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every euro .
on &quot; far more than 50 per cent of the sales were applied .
road lubrication took his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his collabor@@ ators have to be released .
if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , gover@@ ning president Jörg Schmidt could be given to a request by G@@ öhn@@ er , whether there would be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant has benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they have to carry out the dis@@ advantages which result in the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öhn@@ er knows from other coun@@ ties , where there was so much more generous .
with all complaints , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business was set up here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
that other regular guests are now fore@@ see@@ able because of the complicated transport management less frequently , he can understand .
if one can &apos;t go back , it is also quite nice .
that his pedi@@ gre@@ ent@@ ators declined again after the end of restoration work , G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubts .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s already brutal .
in the name of the terrorist fighting in law , it is constantly scre@@ wed .
after the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now establishes a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère announces the reconciliation .
all his proposals are &quot; politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new security package .
they do not demand anyone .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also felt about it , too .
as the Minister of Interior , however , was involved in results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic .
but these are the more extensive .
some is known already announced , announced that a new security authority to worry about the cra@@ ck @-@ encrypted communication is not new .
also , not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU directives for passenger data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies are also not surprising .
for the part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second cross country for proposals that had not been able to do with the SPD : he wants a sympath@@ izing for terrorist groups under sentence and heads with double citizenship the German passport .
&quot; these are difficult points for the SPD , &quot; grants the CDU man .
it nevertheless , however , does not stop this for reasonable and demands nothing , which does not have any chance at the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ist .
a few new ideas presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère too .
they partly in themselves : he plans fast @-@ rules for deportation and more possibilities for detention from deportation .
refugees that are fet@@ ched targeted in the country , should check their smartphones and make social media accounts for a security check exam .
for asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some more worse than ever - such as such , the criminal off@@ ences or their papers deliberately throw away their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
this also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points , in the ine@@ quality of thought , for example - the question arises : what does it really have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between topics refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks in Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people rose wor@@ ries about security in view of the great number of refugees .
and things that were deeply involved in people , had not left off again in election campaign times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the safegu@@ arding is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
in regard to the issue of inner security , Union and SPD are increasing increasingly in position .
in the past days there was high between the two parties .
first , a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a safety @-@ olit@@ ical ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the Ress@@ orts also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , too , is proud to be reconc@@ iled sounds .
from a return from the double pass , he &apos;s nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
you are re@@ inv@@ ent , be not useful .
and in a Bur@@ ka @-@ Ban , he disc@@ ern@@ ed the constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it actually is &quot; zum@@ able , &quot; it is still necessary to show itself .
there is a lot in it that could take care of war .
but the SPD also attempts to pro@@ filing the subject of internal security .
party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only a c@@ auti@@ ous conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security of security . &quot;
even Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ ing is coming through .
despite diesel fuel , the pay@@ roll are increasing worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
there is a term in the response to the response .
Volkswagen starts out by deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car park can continue to be a plus .
but in July , the core brand VW faced its core brand , especially in Western Europe and thus loads the total sale , like that in the Da@@ x not@@ ated companies .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries fell by almost a sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , it has been given a purchase order in some key markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote have also been bur@@ dened by the EU , expl@@ aining a narr@@ ator .
in the US , where the emissions of gas was first calculated , another min@@ us is also being be@@ ech .
major support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony , in further gli@@ mp@@ ing through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , merely an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
sales of the Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue selling a sales plan from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated Volkswagen with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls approximately 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity .
the car will present the customer after the upgrade of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but did not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the group of business .
reason : legal habits are .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen has now granted its German customers a guarantee for around diesel models .
this last Monday , VW @-@ representatives of the Federal Ministry of Transport has been confirmed .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there were this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the editions of my In@@ quiry Commission and the KBA system . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power after the conversion will not take place , and have unchanged any typical vehicle values unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but did not know how it was in business affairs .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come to a workshop half a year after the upgrade , and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interests , it is important to avoid that in any other damage we have nothing to do with the crash sc@@ andal that comes to a violation of possible warranty rules , as it was called .
this is why you do not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demand for rich Spar@@ ks in the future - as second institute in Germany .
on Thursday , President Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers that par@@ ked 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German banks of German banks speaks of an accident and does not see a signal : ordinary Spar@@ row would have to be afraid to pay for their savings pen@@ alties . &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund starting in September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day tra@@ iling .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be around 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he ski@@ pped 40 million euros , which could be raised from one day to the others , and that he could not agree .
&quot; the bank account for me in the central bank account and cause a cost of 0.4 percent , &quot; said the bank leader .
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the costs he continues after the Ver@@ urs@@ ach@@ er@@ principle now .
the cash simply drop into the t@@ res@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four crises , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment platforms .
only a few immig@@ rated to other banks .
the operative association in Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
you alone to wear , &quot; works &quot; is not possible permanently . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for credit cards , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal interest for deposits by three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Bank Association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private customers who have to pay for deposits must be paid for deposits , in addition to the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , which is fully equipped with the fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can be a little bank for a small bank , &quot; if they get free money .
the G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ate @-@ E@@ vil , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs living in the region .
the operative association Bayern &quot; currently has no further banks , which calculate an ec@@ lipse rate for deposits of private clients , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst .
President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s Ban@@ ks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Ban@@ ks ( BvR ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negatives opposite the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ pping the migration of investors to the competition .
customers in Germany will not leave this in the width .
destination panels : who buys sound plates actually ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before you hur@@ ry to over@@ saw him under the p@@ seud@@ onym non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ vy &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the complex reconstruction of sound plates is not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the latest of physical objects , but due to mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who have purchased a record recently , are all pre@@ view after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely waste group .
it is also not a hor@@ des through Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ing - it has an emotional meaning : older record players keep your feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I am in the midst of a bust@@ ling street in So@@ ho , a modest grey suit , and wild bo@@ oming before I stand to hold my hands and determin@@ ate something like : &quot; so let us take a further look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os slowly carries its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specialist .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera to the next part , in which I stand in immediate proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate her age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I spoke of Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men mean age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men mean age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
this sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he could not afford , than they appeared and again selling items that he sold when he was young and ple@@ xed .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy it , &quot; he says .
he is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my truck .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , believe that many customers who meets with the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medi@@ ator , people who have heard about com@@ eback and set up their old records again .
of the talks I have led , people usually have off@@ ended their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to attach@@ ments of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as ph@@ onica , to realise that record shops offers a calm community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to stability of trusted sound platforms , from objects that are happy to be happy with joy .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or ownership of material possessions as a sort of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is with me as collectors so and I think it &apos;s so much in many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff from a plate stack .
a survey of IC@@ M revealed in April that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month is not yet to be heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , have no record players .
at this time of the news report , I would look very worried while I am a pil@@ ing of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men mean age ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ ve .
&quot; someone came up recently here and said , &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I &apos;d like to buy a radio record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ ous .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who first come slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an open audience when I cleans@@ ed .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops , Wild Be@@ asts of the novel synthesis , instead of experimental jazz p@@ amper@@ ed from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ atility at the customer .
none of them looks strange , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard @-@ able , if one stands for someone 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for some minutes in the business and considered the Vari@@ et@@ rics for the sale of the plates .
it rather makes a man@@ ne@@ bo@@ xer as a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so the collectors of records are not a real option , it says .
it costs much .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loved gro@@ aning .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am trying to sc@@ roll the je@@ ans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young girls who think for a moment about Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a cro@@ sley turn@@ tables .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
no one sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to hold them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects may mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about compl@@ ain .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my resear@@ ches revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in record shops in So@@ ho , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and online .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not with the bo@@ asting through record transactions of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they fl@@ atter@@ ed the stub@@ born view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old present@@ er that rises above the shoulders of the middle ages .

French court ref@@ uses Offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should be allowed to disman@@ tle 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical business in which persons offer goods or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would be able to represent a parallel economy , which no taxes would be paid from which no taxes would be paid .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups , not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ vis@@ ing business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are completely re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as only people live &quot; living in extremely pre@@ mise conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm encounter between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly used and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum items for hundreds of protection require , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the pet@@ ition to keep the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; for this children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two aid organisations help refugees Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of the mig@@ rants were estimated that the number of living in the Jazeera was increased to more than 9.000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .

for example , on the highway building or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary Tem@@ plate , there are often no necessary infrastructure to worry there with a stationary fl@@ itter for compliance with the speed limit .
a lasting mobile setting can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ate .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously through several tracks .
variable speed lim@@ bs and through access to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor .
in the high @-@ driven condition it can be used according to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer hook .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the pan were cut down and also disappear from the safe outside of the outside .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is supposed to protect the gl@@ itter in front of V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently France has received 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings Silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain in the 7 @-@ year @-@ old Rug@@ by came to a rup@@ ted stop at the final hur@@ dle at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were sm@@ itten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ v Stadium .
Fiji had a master class in Handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , press back , line @-@ run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad every color .
the defeat was failed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ at , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day could fall in the final .
but rather , in this form , in this form a 15 @-@ man team would have been defeated .
it could be a sol@@ ace for GB - but it will probably not mean that at least one tenth day will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Head trainer Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago she lost every game with Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this strap is we@@ ary , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonder@@ fully and made the GB@@ S of fun off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as if you walk in driving buses . the World Series winners went to top 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au left in the corner .
with another four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly added the ball .
a hot T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa stopped to achieve a third gate , but Fiji only stopped .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a took a touch down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u preached by more weak tac@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so , as in Fiji had been born to play 7 , while GB were still allowed .
this is how it is .
GB resulted in basic changes to half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was running after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favour of the South Se@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , Fa@@ hnen turned and danced on the bund@@ le .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful role of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame replaced the i @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff twe@@ eter , Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB was severely beaten to the lawn .
earlier on the day Fiji had defeated the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals and the United Kingdom brought South Africa in a short@@ age match from the race - UK transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown launched the Bo@@ ke in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke out the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late @-@ late Tac@@ tics of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the Train@@ ers
there will be no fan@@ less gold than in these games , and that wants to be called .
from the first stro@@ ll@@ ing up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the appl@@ ause that were sitting on the Ru@@ ff , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympics without control woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports that put on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter are uns@@ afe , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lete who gli@@ de about the surface with the elegance of vibrations , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to those who make the difference , which make the difference and it was no more helpful than the trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I needed to go better soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ medi@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who made a ner@@ ves in the morning , spent a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it is only repe@@ ating me how much I and Helen and Robin worked together with Helen and Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be a massive Thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would have no better person to coaching or want a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were unable to compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams started to start from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of making something new .
we wanted to do no fireworks today , we just wanted to score a good result , going out and win the race which we did .
the couple will take for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure means .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about 4 minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years exempl@@ ary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is retired .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fr@@ enz@@ y drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the great water producers .
so it was some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken preached the purposes .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing group was &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all of this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who has worked for 31 years , was 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , community Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and W@@ eiler with around 5500 inhabitants .
member of the congregations are Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brunn &apos;s Mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up in 1985 as a water @-@ keeper and was appointed as CEO of the purpose .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water @-@ conducting construction and maintenance work , bud@@ get@@ ing and organis@@ ational activities , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency services on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman .
as outstanding events they named the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land @-@ sections in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ creation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re@@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the parts of water pipes .
it did not have a stand@@ still , and I always included new features because water is giving life eternal and drinking water the most important food .
in their eu@@ logy she praised G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart @-@ blood for its purpose @-@ purpose and he has been living in the water @-@ purpose association as it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago , he regarded as a true practition@@ er of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ t Group on the nit@@ rate number before the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ ks .
he has received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the other hand , praised Aqu@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ structure and the re@@ structure of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult application , however , was the pi@@ pl@@ unge at the high container in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night , so that the settlements could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn was only able to store once , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sn@@ akes .
the management of pot@@ able water purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who occurs the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot;
when the illness had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
meanwhile , the now eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago is now well @-@ reaching and learn private in New York , where there is the best therapist .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about two years , when I sang about the Milan Scala , he reminds himself of nothing , &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko .
but he is the happ@@ ier man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ re@@ b@@ k@@ os with the bass @-@ baritone Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots attention to life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot dead in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 a.m. and wounded them .
&quot; the man Himself called us and given us to have shot his lifetime companion , &quot; said a polic@@ eman .
the perpet@@ rators shall be on the run , according to him will be publicly f@@ eit@@ ed .
by now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the way with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a g@@ ossi@@ p .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
the man has now wearing a g@@ ossi@@ p .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon for himself , so the police .
he who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police talks of an &quot; relationship link . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information on the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a pon@@ ti@@ fying glass . &quot;
&quot; more than we don &apos;t say , &quot; said a Poli@@ ze@@ ism in Lübeck .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses this was a special case . ( SEK ) at the Tat@@ ort .
steel - light sight for the German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from the green power supply , are from the table .
it remain in the Liberation of Renewable Energy Agency at the inventory of the so @-@ called Own production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German General Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday ) .
&quot; I am really glad that we finally could achieve that after two years . &quot;
the European Commission therefore planned to have planned the steel producer , the gases coming from high oven to power generation electricity for its own consumption , to the K@@ asse .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ amp .
only if the generators be replaced in steel plants , an EEG lev@@ y is 20 percent .
but this also won &apos;t be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission to have their own power generation .
in this case , the status quo will be re@@ written largely by the previous regulation .
special importance have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel , the future &quot; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; the IG Metall head Jörg Hofmann , in Frankfurt , has also said on the reform of the Emis@@ sions Trading System . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
in the past year , the situation intensi@@ fied as the world &apos;s largest producer , in view of the weaker demand for mass@@ less steel on the global market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concer@@ tos price d@@ umping .
over the spring of this spring , the situation has something relaxed .
to demonstrate a import duties on imported effect , the economic prospects in China have turned into effect .
it is un@@ clear , as sustain@@ ably the pricing process .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp stayed carefully on Thursday .
last , the rates once again stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to close their works as well as lock@@ ers .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced more than six percent less steel than in the previous year , as the economic re@@ unification steel was closed on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the increased amount of the second month went back succ@@ essively .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year .
in the coming months , the association counts with increasing emissions in the coming months .
community , Spirit , Health : singing for Seniors
the singing has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , teaching positions . she sings the subject of music , and today the 78 year old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
very next door , they are doing something good in her health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German Senior School League .
most seniors sing in choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular merger , senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts .
because frequently , social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to address and organize , to learn from each other and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of compositions . &quot;
sing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler mean .
they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who calls his lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Senior Citi@@ zens .
in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher job value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people often we@@ ave many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies themselves de@@ men@@ ated people rel@@ ying for a long time .
in addition to the head , a special performance is required , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , focus on their own voice and focus on a pre@@ determined rhythm - which is a large cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , practice their own , not only concentrate on itself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that man lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is growing through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I do long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people who li@@ stens to it , if a sound next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , seniors have different ways , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ance in a veter@@ an ench@@ y@@ nel , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
who would like to sing in a church choir , directly to the church or the church stand .
many senior schools can also be found via the Internet .
whoever does not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the Internet .
whoever wants to sing , should always be connected to a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has something fascinating - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover , which effect the rowing of cat @-@ bab@@ ys has grown on adult animals .
at their surprise , the male also didn &apos;t let the males cold - but they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females .
female cats may recognize the im@@ itation of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys on the r@@ ins@@ ing of little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens who were found in great distress , like scientists from the veter@@ an University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also react to the depth of kit@@ ten - but always equal .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the wing of less and heavily poll@@ uted young ones for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams is different with the pressures of their help .
a total of nine adult tom@@ cat and eight cr@@ ates were observed from the livestock farming of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a break of small children , taken for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for others , they were confron@@ ted by scre@@ ams of stronger kis@@ ses , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample of compens@@ ated .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they rot@@ ten faster to the loud@@ speaker , when it played a very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability is possibly an@@ odi@@ zed or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise that the males re@@ acts at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
there were also some studies that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ ation Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski continues with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he was accused of being a terrorist group member .
the first attempt in Turkey will take place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the World Cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is scheduled .
already at the suspension of the acceptance of the insur@@ rection in July , the government , the daily life of normal guarantees should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen who is responsible for the attempt at cleaning .
there is also not one of the football before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
therefore , in the meantime , he is accused of being accused of being a terrorist group in the United States .
Sü@@ hr@@ r shall be the followers of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
true for 90 days , the state of exceptional condition is still valid until October , in fact that the life of the most Turks do not have as good as no effect .
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places in the whole country Erdo@@ gan declared on Wednesday for its end .
the Sport is - as the whole country - divided into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the labor club Bes@@ ik@@ tas do not include the president of the president .
but what the Turks became dramatic and dramatic experience in history , the strict ref@@ us@@ al of military put@@ ts .
there are even the fans themselves - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
its sporty value presented the Cologne season in the dis@@ continued season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season on an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy in his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for record champion found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; also went early in the Europe League early .
in the South Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who served with 26 season op@@ ener as the South @-@ Li@@ g keeper , the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas had announced only the borro@@ wed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country according to his EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it only , &quot; z@@ iti@@ oned the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club leader F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
however , the storms must be ready to refra@@ in at around one third of his at 7.5 million euro estimated annual salary , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary at Florence we can &apos;t pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have still awarded medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
other survived Ath@@ le@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they &apos;re fighting in Rio by medals .

it was a quir@@ ky scene : she was still in the hall with a lifted smile and prov@@ oked her appearance with her appearance .
as determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ on@@ tower .
but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men , who despite d@@ oping the past go to the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversial figures in Ath@@ le@@ tics .
he was blocked twice because of d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its B@@ ann , the 2004 Olympic champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six month lock in 2010 after taking the intake of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .

bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the wife in contact , said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday .
they have suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she had planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und at the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the Southern Cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also are concerned Austrian citizens , be still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stood in a cont@@ enti@@ ous contact with local authorities , so spare parts .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok H@@ in , there were two bombs explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a Nightlife .
according to the police , a Thai police have been killed and injured some 20 people , including the Austrian , three German , three low@@ lands and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ph@@ uk@@ et also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was hurt .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal staff .
according to the authorities in a flower set before the re@@ four of the coastal police had gone into the air .
eventually det@@ on@@ ations requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; said General Staff Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves , but it is likely to do the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and Provin@@ ces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok .
rather , it is estimated that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid out .
the authorities would have received secrets in the past days of sec@@ rec@@ y notes on coming articles in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and the locations .
still , the group behind the attacks are still un@@ clear .
the police rejected their officers in all the country to strengthen security around the major government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment .
there are still smaller bombing in Thailand , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after reason @-@ filled bombs explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on his homepage , to ensure the instructions of Thai security agencies necessarily .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ dy and its surroundings .
in disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips across these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) compens@@ ated for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the Constitution &apos;s military jun@@ ta .
this is a great influence on the military , even in the years ahead .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs were an attempt to cut chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , resi@@ des itself to lead the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in order to get a grip in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok with a stop on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine , there were 20 people killed , most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody assault on the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ itarian Movement &quot; is in the Vis@@ ier of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several regional offices , the Constitutional Court also filed under observation under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; &apos;s Attack points for the democratic democratic principle , &quot; said Constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
such as immigrants from the Ne@@ ar East or the Ne@@ ar East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement too .
the &quot; Ident@@ itarian Movement &quot; is group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of your own identity . &quot;
Constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said his authority has closely matched the state offices .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ itarian Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional chief .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the tried Islam@@ ists as well as legal experts .
this is no bet@@ ting advertis@@ ements for their own business .
propaganda is to address the people emotional .
young people are due in particular ways .
that is dangerous .
recently , there were reports of several German states on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
and Ma@@ did said , he did not have any evidence .
for the constitutional protection , the possible contacts of this species are only relevant to some point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain individuals who are extreme , their objective is changing and so extreme .
thus , it is crucial , whether such persons have controlling influence on the party .
this is not visible .
with a view to the significant increase of rectangular off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee information , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak to new rules in this context .
but we have noticed in recent years that there may be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday Group .
it can be quite obvious that other right @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee practices or attacks from other right @-@ right moti@@ fs .
a clear@@ er @-@ wide or European controller of right @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were present on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about it that many convic@@ tions went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ici@@ encies in attacks on asylum are not known as a criminal , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros at the Rio de Janeiro during the summer .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly exagger@@ ated s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could not see more in the TV pictures .
he just disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ its then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather his un@@ just sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to be more known to swim in sub@@ mar@@ ched countries .
as in Et@@ th@@ op@@ ia , most sport@@ s@@ men run , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
fast the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made him funny about him .
his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , played no role here .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a subur@@ b of 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle alone .

as a reason for the back@@ wards , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy .
details wanted to call a business speaker on Friday .
who , in future , become empty , is still un@@ clear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ many , it was last Friday , at the shareholders &apos; shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of the continued restructuring was largely developed over the years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruit of re@@ structure , however , are not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it .
in view of the last poor Gf@@ K business figures , each share of attendance would be un@@ quiet sometime .

accidents - Bus sli@@ pping into cr@@ um@@ m@@ ons in dit@@ ch : eight per@@ formers
at an accident of a travel agency with 43 seniors as passengers , there are eight people injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to cut their data according to a counter@@ part , which took part in the counter road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokesperson on the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus self @-@ constantly , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency department came to the accident at the national road 2 .
the un@@ finished travelers were returned from a regular bus service to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a spare bus of travel business .
the investig@@ ators requested the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter are from 1 October 2016 for the range of se@@ wer@@ age ; Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then increase again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
according to an extensive calculation , the san@@ itation price in Az@@ endorf is going to be 4,@@ 37 Euro per cubic meters .
as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported the approval of the budget by the country , and Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that for these se@@ wage plants will continue .
due to legal foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities covering the facilities .
starting from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial factories are from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg down deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed a new cal@@ ender of the fees necessary for se@@ wage plants of the market community .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , survivors from the previous cal@@ cul@@ ation period are to be accounted for .
in all three se@@ wage plants , Schmidt established that there are relatively small se@@ wage plants with a very low se@@ wage plant , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for more than one thousand Euros would be serious .
in addition , san@@ itation is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , the period of cal@@ am@@ ation period in all three systems were not least last because of their age san@@ itation and repair applications in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced on mechanical vents due to a damage .
the P@@ ump@@ y Wel@@ fare had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed by almost 20 years of old con@@ vey@@ ors . after almost 20 years of operation the first cl@@ amping pond has had to be installed , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge disp@@ osed of , and an additional ventilation option to be installed in order to be able to hold the water standards in future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calculations period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that low se@@ wer@@ age in the three facilities increased its expend@@ itu@@ res for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs were sp@@ ared in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain in general , especially since we could not expand the supply of se@@ wer@@ age @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ en@@ b@@ acht@@ al for these installations because it is de@@ classified facilities .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .

the annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0,8 % .
the consumer price index compared to June 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .

Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect critic@@ ises as Asian caric@@ ature
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel towards races .
with its filter tool it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already known to the absurd .
you can transform yourself into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a piece which could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ flower , independent tools which generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all failure to the public arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app will prop@@ el Black@@ face to beat or white skin as a beauty deal .
when these week some Us@@ ers proposed a filter which gave them sle@@ epers , false teeth , and ru@@ ined che@@ eks , they called some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly . &quot;
they asked whether these repet@@ itive contro@@ versy fell to a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ atility .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat took it that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as homage to An@@ ime characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ der , the rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us experienced , remin@@ ded the filter of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
others decided to decide the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose names were widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; viol@@ ate and mil@@ dly was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very resi@@ stible Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yel@@ ash of yellow was pulled down .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ er .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration amp@@ f , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in the race of various other players - could expect rather out , sen@@ sibility to expect .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult to remember that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided that as a product manager and engineers , Z@@ hu decided to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial @-@ related contro@@ versy has a lack of di@@ vers@@ atility at the adjust@@ ing practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the large part white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ racce Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either have they no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions , in which they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint which has left the Snap@@ chat mostly un@@ answered .
the company has not published numbers to diver@@ ging his workforce , and shows its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a microphone , the company has recently set a staff responsible for under@@ going population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will release their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;

&quot; news service information , which were typically approved by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ sions , recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it permitted the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quote a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guide errors in Cent@@ Com will stretch up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report clearly shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct hints to change reports that government tops have been given under Obama statements , it shows how analysts at the pressure of their prec@@ urs@@ es were exposed to draw a optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly reflected in the facts . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com members publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Kansas City , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s headquarters changed the down@@ stream reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after giving them , analysts concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during investigations .
in addition , more investigations of Cent@@ Com Reports are underway by the General Inspec@@ tor of the Defense Ministry .
democratic members of the intelligence agency published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com developed an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of engineering ass@@ essments on Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; a member of the House of Represent@@ atives for Adam B. ship , known in a statement .
this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; the mor@@ ality among analysts and &quot; were over@@ ly little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats stated that there were no evidence of any intervention of the White House with Cent@@ Com analysts at a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times of investigations were reported by the Pentagon of the Pentagon , which were surveyed by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ acher of the Pentagon , gave no reports to the Ministry of Defence , while the investigation of the General Inspec@@ tor was still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have very di@@ fying opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion of this important topics of the National Defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( one asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , have thrown out the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds about the Islamic State of the German government as an Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , who looked at the recommendations of many analysts at the time of many analysts at the time of many analysts and have little time to make the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker filed an indication of government officials , that there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , because these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ oral commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the U.S. wins fourth match in the field @-@ hockey field of women , a show@@ down with Britain before .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 sie@@ gs on Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of the American field@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , this knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are simultaneously in their group with the British in the first place that remains unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will set up on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will compete for the first and second place within their group .
the first place will be the strong Dutch @-@ changing little longer out of the way that will lead the other group .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host for four years after the last London Games landed on the last of 12 places .
B@@ am was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they couldn &apos;t qualify for the ca@@ des .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work party in London , which we now have .
we have shed the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the middle range .
India was without victory at the tournament in the game , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the play stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am playing the game into her hands .
they did a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had so far had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s result .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , too late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events are constantly growing and un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , a shaving relay between competition and stre@@ et@@ ables .
it is , when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is to protect from the wrist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers for the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the qu@@ eue at the qu@@ eue , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ wer@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of s@@ warm , could have been sent to the Prime Time , constructed by sponsors and welfare @-@ TV ads , if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade , the sports that are not univers@@ ally accepted : air@@ gun shoot , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest , and may it reign long .
but when I want to make a modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me get the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump already has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so spar@@ sely perceived that many who had questioned , did not know that it is a Olympic port .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never gained a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and had a ath@@ lete up until 2012 , which made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has some outer side char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ cleared ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than those for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ onic trem@@ or of his never @-@ to @-@ end pr@@ un@@ ing - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ table and divers , the two sports that were essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means something like &quot; jumping board . &quot;
asc@@ end winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a range of falling movements ( turning , h@@ genuine and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
according to the official Olympic program , you will be assessed according to design , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete in Rio on each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts hopes in their pursu@@ it to gold , qu@@ icker , upward and beyond , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV broadcast also another mo@@ dest@@ al goal : the world or the Olympic Games .
the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator .
but it &apos;s also what I &apos;m trying to see this games as a bit tired .
this trampoline offers a breath .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she p@@ onder@@ ed , seem@@ ingly heavy as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes down , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ less again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolves enter the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant raising of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
the quali@@ fier and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will cut the final round as part of a afternoon block on two days from 2@@ pm .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably see in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase of consciousness can only be reached by the anxiety and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his after air rin@@ d , new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long , the United States of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia are calling on violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that some protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with police with police .
is Ethiopia turning together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid consortium of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but protests against the government in recent months sho@@ ok the country and spread out more areas in more areas .
last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave up that polic@@ emen shot down and killed police un@@ armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , some videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security sle@@ epers suggest young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the UN Committee for Human Rights now demands an incoming examination .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of International Crisis Group , a Research Group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians in order to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy continues to expand in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ ition train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia were all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly continued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sidents were effectively brought to silence .
many were sent into exile , or imprisoned in prison , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints , that cover everything from the ground level up to the worms in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
after an extended election last year , the ruling party and its allies gain the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this tender , controversial line demanded hundreds of life in June .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced out more or less in recent years , could use turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of the pro@@ bit@@ ing after years of fear will now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved by Internet services .
even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies , hiding place where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave up that they were gathered together to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Ä@@ onen , the Am@@ har@@ as , the predominantly Christian floo@@ ding , come out in the politics and the economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u said , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that account for around 6 percent of the population and the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics are dominant .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ sealed illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was especially re@@ alising in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction perceive and make special contra@@ ctors to edit enemies and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is missing on this principle , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen out of relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the status of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services of the Tig@@ ray security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government and subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ cia , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last few months and this time of turbul@@ ence went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ition train , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in the poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but obviously , this does not prevent the Inten@@ si@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray will always be more common in social media .
analysts say that protests the US and other Western allies bring in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights via the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to be united in an already vol@@ atile area .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin slide . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy on Friday to overthrow his campaign by repe@@ ating his several repeated claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication began new questions about communication skills of the presidential candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ low@@ ways to take an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain the real position , which he could not have meant .
after gradu@@ ating at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really not intended to signi@@ fy , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early mor@@ sel on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ic .
as opposed to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump in a series of interviews said he said the exc@@ use perfectly seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement somewhat , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate did not want to know anything .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que on Mr. Tr@@ ump desc@@ ending , while he tried to control the focus of his campaign due to falling fluctu@@ ations on economic conditions .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism as he said that the Russians should dice Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ mails , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then back to ru@@ ders .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then if needed , &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his testim@@ onies , so they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even corro@@ sive tone since its r@@ fra@@ cture has gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he acc@@ uses his critics frequently to unite his statements or hum@@ our humor .
but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps kid@@ ze his loyal Mit@@ stre@@ ites into the un@@ comfortable situation to him , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may like his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ate advoc@@ ate , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said that he was asked about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense , that before Obama , ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back @-@ b@@ yst@@ ers , completely false , and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most Ma@@ instream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government served as Foreign Minister in Mrs. Clinton to spread ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East , under control .
in front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them out on any of his words and to be vo@@ iced .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , un@@ u@@ ber@@ ful &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ends over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further evidence that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential Office .
once more about the price of the market , café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a play@@ ful café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay bar that had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop was pushed .
buy So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the shape of cup@@ cakes .
locals mour@@ ned as last loss in a genetically modified town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also new one .
a animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafés .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new external power , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment with experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ns like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions .
there is nature spirits .
the café is no beer more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ acked electricity to old tribe customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through William@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after Green@@ point was drawn , she would take the way forward .
after the Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture of the Ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; she said .
now she drinks coffee again , even if they had iced a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea in this day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , who is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered it to be the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Everything ba@@ gel with bacon , eggs and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t h@@ eg@@ round about that the soap business has taken the old business space .
indeed , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee bars as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish language and Rodri@@ guez said that he proposed to stop them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to neighboring buildings .
for many clients , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground , when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the location of the Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a foo@@ dies , President Roosevelt had a Fa@@ i@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ plates soup .
his menu on this day was something modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a p@@ ud@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people &quot; said Jane Z@@ ck@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the US , while the bricks in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a home house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash of 1929 .
Z@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese and@@ oned with oli@@ v@@ enst@@ ück@@ chen , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable salad .
when rep@@ orters ordered h@@ ackers , this was suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich foods were extremely popular , &quot; said Z@@ bri@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , meat cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .

&quot; it must be placed in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male Fel@@ dar@@ es and it was served fresh pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that sent food to an hung@@ ering Europeans during the First World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the ways to which the country went on , no longer meant to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans became a central , ang@@ ed topic , &quot; I was buried , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new Bud@@ get@@ h was the same as the new budgets : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and ke@@ epers have been given to basic food , the casserole as a &quot; wonderful way , eating remains re@@ warding , &quot; there could hide very appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ eping sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat that had been the centre of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ish satisfaction was prec@@ e@@ dence over taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , a court made a court of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular addition of the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
brick continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other .
it was typical for the home business concept .
as ever before or ever since , business econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stanley , head of Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - eating habits of the country so much .
in making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become a &quot; house@@ holder women &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ m@@ ige sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical le@@ ak@@ ages .
in particular , the reports about the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Essen attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa peas@@ ant cuisine of his kitchen , he sp@@ ells like the million@@ aire @-@ heavy man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucum@@ ber &quot; , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in a almost gold @-@ gold dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delicious real@@ ist@@ ically .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to static his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the cultivation of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt took that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most likely to be prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , to cope with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , strife said , as well as science was applied to food .

&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .

after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they stri@@ pped and co@@ e prepared a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um termin@@ ates , ate president Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; there is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Z@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes should be missed .

bomb attack killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat on his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar married his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a Fass@@ bomb attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to the image newspaper has saved about 60,000 people so far .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers make their own life in the game to pull people out of torn houses and to afford first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him in a 11 hour rescue child from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
but as heroes , he never saw himself , according to the image : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter cast four facade bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; cited the image his last words before he died .
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ist is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ x@@ ia are usually only in the winter for the surface .
this ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - today .
Greenland just got up with 150 years of offspring .
in common , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k on the bottom of the North Atlantic along , in an hour he gets on average 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it depends , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed , half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this characteristic of lon@@ el@@ iness , however , seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least from Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ ed@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock is this life expect@@ ancy that means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are hard to watch , finally they live in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they would water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter .
researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ x@@ ia according to little .
her tim@@ el@@ pent@@ o looked like her , when they took six animals with a transmitter .
prey do these shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal found researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed the ja@@ w bones of a young polar bears .
possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and looking for ca@@ da@@ ver , who are spread out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , the fisher@@ man between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the biggest 502 @-@ cm measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the shar@@ ehol@@ ding of the shar@@ ks with the Carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye @-@ lens arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained proteins later no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lenti@@ cular core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempts to drag larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
with 220 centi@@ meters length of the third s@@ ligh@@ test animal , the linol@@ eic acid contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
in contrast , all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ x@@ ia had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the Record @-@ Ha@@ i with 502 centi@@ meters is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Green@@ land@@ hai females then get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could as@@ sign up an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ metres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live especially in icy waters , is no coincidence .
the old record holder , an 211 @-@ year old Greenland w@@ al , caught a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska in front of Alaska .
due to low temperatures often the organism of living animals live in savings .
so they mature later - and al@@ tern slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on to concentrate as many offspring as possible , &quot; says the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist .
a very large animal , however , should invest his resources in a long life .
construction site in double pack
with topics around building , the municipal at the most recent meeting has been focused on the most recent session .
with relief , the panel accepted the notification made by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently proven residential buildings can begin . &quot;
after the ground@@ breaking , par@@ cel@@ ing and exclusive issues were clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; street road &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - section of section 1 ) has nothing more in the way for those interested parties .
the community is convinced that the banks in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau young families and ru@@ bi@@ ous seniors to speak equally .
as it was said , building site can be noti@@ fied immediately in the town hall , on the dispos@@ ition of the plots will be advised by the Municipal Council in its September meeting .
for further inquiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , the community decided to change the newly created area plan in part areas only in the spring of this year .
in the field of under@@ time , the commercial area has already been expanded in the area around two plots to state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main is therefore the best chances to attract jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ stein , head of the competence of competence and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ passport to them the approval in the UK has so far enough .
they just use large US banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs to lay jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities as well as the European insurance list E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) took their headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the bank note is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ stein .
in Luxembourg , there is a large fund sector , cutting edge but as well as Dublin at the infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt is considerably easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .
further points of the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ stein .
in addition to the Seine , the ten@@ ants for top @-@ quality commercial real estate is by 50 percent higher than the main one .
furthermore , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is located at No. 7 , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences , &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W is fol@@ lic@@ ated .
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit , the economic researcher .
in addition , in accordance with the numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , Landesbank Hel@@ aba worked around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US National Committee decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal cost , which made it from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a compensation amount of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines So@@ val@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge issued a pattern of mis@@ conduct on mer@@ ing , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts .

Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal tax
Hillary Clinton released its fiscal statement for 2015 , this resulted in the Democrats and her husband , an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister , issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s book on her book in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced by Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ ae@@ i in a statement .
in a cr@@ un@@ ks , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and returns to his previous promises to his previous promises .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a control examination by the tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Co@@ hen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor , CNN says that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks are not finished .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned his ref@@ us@@ al questions regarding assets , his donations for welfare organizations , its business divisions and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown on the issue and released a video on the internet in which the senior rep@@ ublic@@ ans began to publish his tax statement .
on Thursday she spoke the topic even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate did in the last decades and publish its tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist in the New York Times recently added a series of tax lawyer and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case .
we have become a subject in electoral struggle .
Clinton supports a provision that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat to exchange tr@@ ump on its tax returns .
buff@@ ets said he was subjected to the IRS as well as a tax examination of the IRS and tr@@ ump have &quot; fear , &quot; in front of the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax declar@@ ations back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , who now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the fiscal year of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike most of the Americans .

Jewish director dismant@@ ling Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; ref@@ res@@ ence - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots has unle@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed any Israeli pre@@ fix as it had requested Arab guests according to a employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &apos; Sho@@ a &apos; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the list of the hotels .
however , the country was not listed in the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s new Germany , it is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an option to choose Israel via an own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; he sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , he dissolved even more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great confusion , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and ma@@ stered by this event .
that is really very compl@@ aining .
the fact that this has to be allocated in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the ministers .
the incident dissolved a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged support of the Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; it was written in another post in which it was noted that the hotel that is situated at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly proved all the exc@@ uses of itself and called the incident a &quot; Ver@@ see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel does not record into the high @-@ ranking list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung had a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
it adds up that the country code has now been added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students came together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with police , when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for public education systems .
the police set Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de to the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties began , as a police officer tried students to deal with what led to the police , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals of the govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , whereas 300,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest@@ ers man saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the youngest protests took place some days after demonstr@@ ators in masses went to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been enth@@ used by a vote of the Senate to its con@@ vocation from the office .
trade between Russia and Iran increases to 71 % - RT business
according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade exchange between Moscow and Teheran , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent , compared to the Russian ambassador in Iran .
since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strong on businesses in the country , the ambassador was dealt with .
Russian companies take existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further trade is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he realized that the trading volume between Russia and Iran was in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran climbed 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade union was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year the Russian foreign representatives represented around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily as Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affect the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record number of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something like the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner is stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold for cyclists
Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ste last night in the men team @-@ Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took hold of the anch@@ ors who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the party and made legend proudly as he sho@@ cked home to take a victory of the New Zealand New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick , after taking place in March at the train world championships in London despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man with whom they remained when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and S@@ kin@@ ner sat in the qualifying round of a Olympics , but in the standard round the New Zealand celebrated the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
passing away after his round , Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner held it .
a strategic change made a large proportion of transformation , in the execution in a higher speed to slow down it and it Kenn@@ y and above all S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked out of his position as a BBC Expert and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and to make a name .
we have set up a Olympic champion in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the page of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der gave to the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ der said , &quot; It feels like the whole GB of flags on the bund@@ le of London . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve been so bad in so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect to be successful five days in the vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possi@@ bil@@ ty that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the che@@ me of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint &apos;s Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
Hin@@ der said , &quot; If he gains two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ ble competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ve Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race race .
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where the Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
in yesterday , he fought against the qualification round of qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women competition that continued tomorrow and finished , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ ou@@ sel Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
it played drama in the background , leaving the resignation of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ pre@@ ferences as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , then the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
the future of the melting of Portland , due to raising the energy agreement
the future of al@@ sch@@ mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , as the plant driver will announce the energy supply contract , and thus will raise all delivery contracts , as the supplier of energy companies rejected .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate .
the payout is scheduled for 20 years in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa plant in Portland are available on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
in addition , it could occur to domin@@ oes , since the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melting pot which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a lock@@ out .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the installation .
AG@@ L who supplies the large aluminum car with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ Am Valley , it proceeds that three other owners will leave their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , including the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller parts .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for power by the melting pot , &quot; divided the company with .
AG@@ L continues to be announced that the contracts called &quot; he@@ dging transactions &quot; were supposed to have entered into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; from hen@@ ce@@ forth , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the supplier of electricity .
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointment markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that the value of contracts had already been written in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol ... can operate the melting pot or the power supply to the melting pot . &quot;
the U.S. company said that there have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a explanation , why it has been re@@ signed by the Treaty .
analy@@ st war@@ n thanks to the bad economic conditions of the sector in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consumption approximately 900 meg@@ awatts each year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just one Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality @-@ TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ os@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ist and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Cl@@ ans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sept@@ et issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people who I love , the sight of this co@@ vers brought me to weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise party .
this represents virtually every birthday of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You would like that we should have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a drawing edge at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but Kris had to participate in the public@@ ity at this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s sister Kim likes her that the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( they and their husband Kan@@ ye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the September issue is available for Vog@@ ue most in the most sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles a fashion journal than a fashion magazine , the output resem@@ bles a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the kit ( 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ dec is expected to be ho@@ oked in recent two years before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
over the past few years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the modeling &quot; as &quot; models , the famous ones are &quot; on the cover .
in 2013 , Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Mrs J@@ enner is described by the magazine as the &quot; Dis@@ rup@@ ture model &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to play a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to each denom@@ in@@ ator ) .
they are truly talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always imp@@ aired in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ized them . &quot;
these feelings come up again , when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but riding on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the V@@ os@@ ue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your base of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all her sisters sell you pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is on the reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal coun@@ cils point annually 160@@ ,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aid members of the country are exp@@ elled annually by the municipal committee , while the sector accounts for the effects of other intermediate cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of odd del@@ og@@ ations and the like are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal rights .
legal services to the municipality , which are already reas@@ onably priced , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of its federal states .
the director of the Municipal Coun@@ try@@ side of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council concluded that thousands of people are rejected each year every year .
in Far@@ rell , Far@@ rell said that the government would only be even worse .
&quot; Queens@@ Scotland Municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and re@@ pressing debts , families who have been released through separ@@ ations , workers who have been wrong - all those people have problems righ@@ tly and this survey will not need the help you need .
in June 2017 , the federal government will reduce the average of 30 percent , which means thousands of helpful people from Queensland to be forced to maintain their legal problems without any aid .
we demand the General Prosecutor and Federal State Minister and Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift this medium term immediately , so that people may need the help they need to receive legal problems .
last year the state government fulfilled their promise to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of community centres and its customers , as well as the Government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l survey in front of countries : SPD and CDU
with the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , substantial losses for the government party SPD and CDU out .
this revealed a representative surveys from the opinion research initiative ins@@ a for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could be ra@@ ining ahead , this is not possible after the fra@@ ct@@ als in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to continue to head Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell by 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CDU that could rise again to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left hand came to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country day .
the Gre@@ ens remained in spite of a slight loss of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the heavy duty country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented with 3 percent each in the country day .
according to the Member of the House of Dep@@ uties , the SPD survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU was only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
it still sounded behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives with 14 percent .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market .
today the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite pal@@ pit@@ ations .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abyte , this would be sufficient for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigabyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros enthusiasts can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the western part format . &quot;
in fact , the new cell phone was able to receive a lot of : SMS and emails were sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible via HTML brows@@ ers , even qu@@ itting slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found themselves .
very proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could use in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has been different since then .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone map of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disin@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft .
today the market domin@@ ate today , which all came up much later than Nokia .
always online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple alone accounts for 5@@ 55 million units .
global sales with equipment is around 400 billion euros .
in addition , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and telec@@ oms are coming .
around the smartphone is now a whole industry .
the crucial breakthrough for mass market came first in early 2007 , then the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World to launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he talked three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , everything by touch screen is easy to use .
the victory of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the re@@ viewing .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention , a self @-@ understanding .
today , every German is now looking for 88 times a day .
&quot; we must learn all of them to get the smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel .
meanwhile , permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing .
England must wi@@ red the Olympic spirit and the Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only in our local commun@@ es and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , it was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we spent a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympics has great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be back , by creating new opportunities for local and companies near Heath@@ row .
for our local communities there are already 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs are creating and youth unemployment in the airport environment are preparing an end .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that they will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heath@@ row is too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will fade on the world stage .
the branch had no wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heath@@ row answered any question .
like the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is a lot and not for individual infrastructure project .
enlargement is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to grow growth and a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole GB .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we expand this olymp@@ ic spirit and create Heath@@ row as well as our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ er &quot; regarding display block
for companies working with on@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturing attempts to handle advertising block , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ oleum . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block advertis@@ ers on his desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it claims that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that his desktop page would change the coding page on its advertising , in order to identify advertis@@ ers which is part of the advertising is to be harder to difficult .
but Ad@@ block announced that there has found a new way to handle new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the temp@@ ting open source community and the conver@@ ters have already been under way since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest companies have settled in the fight is a strong indi@@ z that has become a strong indi@@ an indication for the industry .
according to a study published by the last year of Pa@@ f@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people will use advertisement ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day active users that access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung makes up 84 percent of advertising revenue from Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has an advertisement block on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block devices have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , he shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues , so Facebook is the investment of such a stri@@ de as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that there would be more &quot; ad pre@@ ference pool &quot; to have more control over them in order to get more control over them .

woman with suspected suicide on Swiss Highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday had suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman placed herself in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , was to kill himself .
she died before place .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident to report .
it was opened an investigation procedure which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation divided by Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ ids ?
that is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark on the highway ran - was decided that drivers do not assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of neg@@ lec@@ tic killing was acquitted when they had taken a man and killed one night at the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the street , and took the court .
the court determined that the polic@@ eman had responded to an emergency call -- to justify a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should be aware of the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms , which resem@@ bles those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have been exposed to similar conditions .
scientists have previously mentioned that the slow reverse of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ ect @-@ like atmosphere , and still progres@@ sed slowly .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry places than the Earth , but had once spread enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accom@@ o@@ date life and shake off faster ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was about 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the long rotation of Venus exp@@ on@@ ates its day side of the sun almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a ra@@ ins to remove the surface of a large part of sun@@ heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of Earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution that was suspected of planetary research .
although it was probably resident , Venus -- over the course of several billion years , was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ ap@@ sed and their water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
when you moved to Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers gave the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado , and led them to the team &apos;s decision @-@ making decision .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years , I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che filled with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy turned out in a position .
I thought much in the summer of summer and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give him a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a involvement in decisions that influence the teams &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
today Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season he was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten to the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota in the first round of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ r@@ wart has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take up talks again , strike your strike out
the working class regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers will be suspended , while all disp@@ utes of the parties are putting together for a new discussion on the table , said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and in@@ hib@@ ited trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the winding process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , the beginning of the next year will start to re@@ sign the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company has the required space to come through the market crisis .
Shell has dismissed and set up plans for his part thousands of people and plans to im@@ pose its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ aph@@ rag@@ m , with the British energy company BG Group r@@ ational .
energy companies are located due to the lower rates under pressure , a economic situation that reli@@ ed on the decision by the British in June to rely on the European Union .
in the beginning of this week , Dave Anderson has met workers to discuss one of the largest employment disp@@ utes that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler &apos;s rotation rate of stars in the star@@ board of the Ple@@ y@@ ades
the latest mission with Kepler &apos;s dream teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star@@ base of the Ple@@ y@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star@@ base at different rates , as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are available with the planet level .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a press release .
the star@@ base of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from Earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now rotating on the fastest .
at top rotating rates , these mature stars encounter large quantities of ast@@ er@@ winds .
since these winds are travelling through the stars of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ igned , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizes the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less than massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes turn smaller than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ y@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster Rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star@@ board of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ board of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull .
there is still a lot about how we want to know more about how , when and why stars are slow down their rot@@ ational rates , so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the pro@@ j@@ ades of the Ple@@ y@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star is starting
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional release announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to teach , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his sub@@ title under a ten @-@ year contract signed him 27 million dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrast on December 31 , 2017 , he served as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as players , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he made a number of mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys only have two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics of similar values .
but the 41 year @-@ old is not yet to be recorded in the fame hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field so cont@@ ested its occurr@@ ence outside of the square .
in 2009 , the Super@@ star was delivered to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , prohibited ster@@ oids to have taken place .
in August 2013 , he was locked up to 211 games following an execution in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main suspect for years to have received performance over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the league could even have been a pleasure for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time .
his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends had once again received the big stage again , Rodri@@ guez needed to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win each game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and actress Kate Hudson in the Hudson River , Kate got his sympathy to sympathy and sympathy of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ rival Boston Red SO@@ X .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the p@@ endants with the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Target are first d@@ oping
caught : because of a positive d@@ oping sample , weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be o@@ vers@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by the first official dates .
an experienced ath@@ lete could have won almost a medal .
in front of the seventh competition day , the first official dates of the Rio de Janeiro became known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ insky were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the Ath@@ le@@ tics Cont@@ ests , these messages come to the accident .
over the last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic of hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had been detected last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked means of d@@ oping sub@@ stit@@ utes .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ court CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games in Friday .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , it missed the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to attend the qualification over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the National Association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the research , &quot; z@@ iti@@ oned X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will be working with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old also went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; the ath@@ lete explained .
according to the report , it should act with the banned substance to deal with the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agents EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was temporary suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial also should have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow immediately applied to word with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t move the right sl@@ abs , &quot; he said , &quot; We are on observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
thus , about all weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter from the nation &apos;s chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ated nation can not take part in Rio .
on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
taking both the taking , they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had signed the entire Russian team up to a exception because of systematic de@@ op@@ ings , also the L@@ äu@@ ge Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous version in China had also triumph@@ ed in China for heavy disp@@ utes between athletes .
this is how the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio .
in addition , Sun stood at the centre of a meditation on Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping block@@ ers , &quot; said this .
sun was tested for the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only a three @-@ month lock had to sit down .
dat@@ alog@@ y : so per@@ fi@@ de presses her del@@ ay@@ ing money
programm@@ ers of replacement malware : currently targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a current survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surveyed companies have at least once , partially several victims of attack with compres@@ sors software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a Ran@@ som@@ ware press .
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly from the poles required to take advantage of the required systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alise their compres@@ sors software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company network .
if they are successful there , the pot@@ ency can be considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of pollut@@ ants , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to cover advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the perpet@@ rators software for themselves .
only private use was the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once installed on the computer an account , they are specifically looking for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the compres@@ sors .
in order to receive the final turn@@ key code , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency bit@@ coin .
but where with private use the personal photo @-@ database is on the game , it &apos;s about companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage fall from when a Ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies contra@@ cted sales by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business activity completely , in case of a case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals were already being threatened by attacks in Germany , whose patients can be threatened with loss of acute symptoms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 per cent of the firms pay , pay their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in light of stand@@ still in operation .
h@@ ackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the compres@@ sors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and will individuals be saved after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must part hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware re@@ print , h@@ ackers are becoming professional and share the work , explained security experts from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
the more likely it is , however , that it is three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their pollut@@ ants then in the form of a software package to the real press press@@ ors .
the existing malware kits were created by malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the press@@ ors then search for further h@@ ackers , to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the underground , rede@@ em@@ ing the set of one crimin@@ als and t@@ asked another to install the software on as possible as many PCs .
payment is made per in@@ adequ@@ ately calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then contribute to spread with spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known to many companies that ensure their data .
over 50 per cent of the companies responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware via file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software can be stopped .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already following new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data only is no sufficient threat to successful path@@ o@@ gens , the perpet@@ rators instead cont@@ acted with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or quot@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the damage potential depending on the type of data , about a multiple times higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could have completely new goals on the internet of things on the grain .
at the h@@ acker conference , def@@ ensive security researchers demonstrated how to get to their control with the Internet @-@ connected thermo@@ stat .
in the middle of winter , the non @-@ shift of a der@@ art blocked heating so much sacrifice is definitely worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole factory road instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday dust
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond , it doesn &apos;t work closely .
the materials of the Interior are well processed and act pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l is available at high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that is less magical than it sounds : the seat of the back bench can be set up like chin @-@ up and offer storage space , which is from the floor up to the ceiling of 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot room can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp is accelerated the HR @-@ V thanks to torque torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
he is likely to refra@@ in his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is still another power@@ train : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a bit direct .
the quality variant &quot; Executive &quot; has no wishes to be desired in the tested top version &quot; Executive . &quot;
the safety systems belongs to the City emergency assist@@ ent ( process up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the trace assistant .
sometimes the coll@@ ision was irrit@@ ated sometimes because he rated many obstacles in the rank@@ ings as &quot; drawing objects . &quot;
the remote assistance work is very reliable .
and the smart temp@@ t react to the traffic sign detection and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t at need the speed .
the full connectivity exists only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel engines are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros , the diesel starting from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and open @-@ day car .
Air@@ line is not responsible : overthrow of air gas bridge
an Air@@ line is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the air passenger bridge .
as a liability may be conc@@ ei@@ vable only upon dangers , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the upper chamber of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken up with the fall of a knife .
the accident happened , however , could happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as judgment .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
serious vac@@ ation@@ ers can only return money after their journey , if the cause of the disease is doub@@ tful in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests account the same symptoms show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ating case a family was severe in the second day of its Turkish l@@ ur@@ k hard to diar@@ rhoea and vomiting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease resulted in a faulty plumbing , which supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family was the view , the journey was so lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organizers .
prior to court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
indeed , the treatment situation was in fact defective .
but the organizers only knew just before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then , that the sea was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the verdict .
especially in the samples of the water no contamination were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by infection one another - belong to the general life of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence of violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state had to react and decided to react to terror at the same time .
for sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators not with hatred and split .
in this triumph , we won &apos;t allow the terrorists .
when offen@@ ders had to leave the country , but increase security and strength , even the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals for the 2017 federal election .
he also announced a further person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; over several years , &quot; over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be re@@ treated again .
video surveillance should be improved , the arms was correct so that above all , the purchase of weapons will be created on the Internet .
finally , the last much discussed silence for doctors should stay in the words after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , such as the endang@@ ering of the citizens could be reduced , he said with views of the mental consp@@ ic@@ ation .
in order to counter@@ act more radic@@ alization of refugees , Minister of Ministers holds a better social care for .

the SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security of security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior clearly testified against shareholder .
&quot; this was a ear@@ ring for the hing@@ es in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Media group ( Friday ) .

better transport flow at the highway
there are regularly on the circum@@ vent - here a picture from November .
but that should change : the de@@ fle@@ ction is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the traffic road every night at St@@ au when they drive on the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road @-@ operation extends to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler street the right track by 700 meters .
drivers can be mounted directly from the Hammer street right .
the great advantage : traffic shares early , thereby reducing the total production process on the complex section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the driving road on the Zu@@ br@@ inger gets the car driver especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .

for this reason , the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on the B 51 is just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic only takes only one @-@ track on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back to the three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations revealed that the bridge has no more the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated St@@ au persi@@ sted , the competent country can not say .
however , to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has a official resi@@ du@@ ous period of up to 20@@ 34 .
for extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state @-@ operation deliberately chose the traffic fe@@ eb@@ ble time in the school holidays , because the disability is to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .

rain instead of star@@ ring : hope to repair weather repair

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening there are forever around , at night you can wake up hours , in the morning it is not far from wake up to sleep .
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , one is concerned with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent do their sleep often or permanently as a relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and it can be underlying the causes of them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ epers and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , thus a single and sleep problem .
in just this , many people feel uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , the board member of the German home@@ work association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ oral factors , but also drugs .
not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is often frequent in depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors want to thank each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can &apos;t be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ able , over all day problems and take care of sal@@ ing , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep problems to the doctor ?
if you do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week and should be affected by day , the doctor should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look completely different : it is dis@@ rup@@ ted , tired , irregular , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood s@@ wings or physical symptoms such as stomach and headache .
to relie@@ ve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , there are behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases , and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany there are hardly any kind of sleep specialist in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ on@@ ger , head of the inter@@ disciplinary dormit@@ ory medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , one should first contact with sleep problems at the dent@@ ist , the we@@ e@@ ß is advis@@ able .
the problem may clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
to study in sleep laboratory rates , for example in snor@@ ing with breathing , in disease @-@ day fatigue , in bed@@ bugs or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder , Fi@@ ona explains .
you do not have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; says fi@@ xation .
after the c@@ abling , one goes into the bed at its normal time .
in addition to electro@@ des on the body one carries a nose @-@ g@@ og@@ gles , chest strap and an ant@@ enn@@ as at the finger .
furthermore , a camera displays the sleeping on the ceiling .
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pitches where you can place for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , not too long in bed , not watch TV to sleep , alcohol avoid drinking and at night not at the clock - then you start at once , and that &apos;s quite and certainly not eligible .
what the Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ camp with missing medals in swimming
former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has failed to dis@@ close the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is on Facebook .
in December 2014 , he first captured Gold Championships for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has protected his former ex @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € pre@@ mia and a jungle of € 150,000 should not be surprised by any missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the feed system in the swimming sport is bad , the d@@ oping control , however , is very good .
thus , we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote the very much and do not work with d@@ oping on d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
just like that , you should hold it with countries .

airport : gang of luggage arrested
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ici@@ encies had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and luggage steels .
against 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants recognised the civil servants in the field of Düsseldorf , a gang that was known by the police officers from the past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ ately in mid @-@ July this year , and were common , working and particularly professional .
the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ mis@@ ery 34 allows the th@@ ie@@ ves to have travelled to Germany by perpet@@ rated four actions .
in total , they tot@@ alled 15,000 euros in total .
Alt@@ constructions , a few lin@@ king stal@@ ks , in between yet another head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in operates at the first glance , but the police force them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from the east to the west , one gets on toys , refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a Li@@ dl which will soon be demolished , it is already built : by 2017 , there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate agency Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , preferred by inflamm@@ able cars in the last weeks .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of lease income , on the ground floor are occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , in the beginning of the year , handle left for a hard time the police against the project pronounced , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rol the police for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site , locked parts of the road and kept visitors off to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , newly renovated building workers in order of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration of the Berlin administration decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers went down under the youth of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer morning the road works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others keep in front late .
in the immediate vicinity of the hood , a primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
le@@ ft@@ ist violence is not the main care of many local people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who draws up three children here , are mainly driven by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the hood , they share the concern before increasing r@@ ying and genetic engineering .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who pre@@ ju@@ dice a majority of polic@@ eman in front of v@@ andal@@ ding left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator and the police set up between the owners and their neighbours , does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk .
also household appliances and the native residential projects include a long time to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by former German GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the main@@ tain@@ ers were cleared under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alised within the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become the mag@@ nets for tourists and election liner from around the world : with them , people from East Germany &apos;s times and former Haus@@ er preserved their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable by the rent@@ ers , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you recognize them on designed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were used with stain@@ ings .
no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , that not all neighbours may view the problem , it might be that they are not necessarily concerned by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body inj@@ uring statistics , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the alleged off@@ ences make non@@ damage caused by the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house beside the controversial 94 years , the un@@ certainty cannot be given .
what violence is concerned , they are compl@@ aining : the people in 94 are their neighbours , those who have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars are even longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , its street is not a criminal combustion point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and get more each other than one another . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that the residents will return to their streets : by the police , politics and the media , all in July all suddenly occupy the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of residents , as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by hundreds of constructions in former building blocks , that push the old residents .
&quot; these are ultimately ownership apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well @-@ known , &quot; she says .
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ id@@ ate . &quot;
but what should I do if someone does not listen to someone ?
there is also fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for listen@@ ers who like more than coloured bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the hood projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who go behind , should be aware of him - just like someone who attracts to a pub area where you can easily compl@@ ain about noise .
all only presented with first names were asked to be called , not named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commissioned
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organizer .
in addition , she is a social worker .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as contacts for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group indicates that the hon@@ ours are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the jeal@@ ous Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem especially .
so some - less mo@@ cked as much as rather on the multitude of adv@@ ances are targeted - meant that the administration wanted to write the passage .
we were looking for an administration company with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organization , work with the people on site and also behind the scenes , as well as networks .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and official players are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new Container in the Was@@ strasse are available soon .
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for the connection of vol@@ atile agents who have been recognized .
in charge of the connection , the municipalities are in charge .
you must under@@ take the refugees in your own or rented areas .
the costs for the construction , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the estate community , community service and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration doesn &apos;t find private apartments .
not so far , it was not possible to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community apartments have to be checked , as it is so beautiful .
so new containers will be set up in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master , do @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
it hopes that work for the community has a positive external effect .
that is no employment therapy . &quot;
it does not only mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a cour@@ ge feeling .
so there are offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so there are also administration and hon@@ ours here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it takes and take time to survive the time , for example with language courses .
those who sometimes feel the feeling that he could not work in Ur@@ bach , must not work , and be un@@ profitable , which will never be integr@@ ating .
the distinct majority are motivated .
the problem is also , however , says the customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two were afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer says quite clearly , &quot; which can call man@@ ger na@@ i@@ v . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could and can &apos;t exclu@@ de them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents have also been the subject of refugees .
they would have fear that the ass@@ ass@@ adors came out completely into custody .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so far , main and hon@@ our@@ able site must look forward in the region and in the region after activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
this question clear to answer , the policy turned .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place her hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there , where we would like to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , this would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher has already been fully utilized to in@@ corporate the previous human beings .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young males .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women are lon@@ ely .
the political situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
