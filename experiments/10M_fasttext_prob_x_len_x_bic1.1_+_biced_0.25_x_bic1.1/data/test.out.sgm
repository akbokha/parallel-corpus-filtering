<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf course in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with some colleagues and a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses reminded their holiday, they pursued fast gallop in the fast gallop at home.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I have dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that ended the riding career then again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golf course was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left with his family about the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't swear to a photo.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid delivered the man out of Anhausen in a small gala as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">At awards there is no lack of sympathetic sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Former federal secretary, silver bay leaf, champions tour players of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen caught him already.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award is very much," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sportive successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way.</seg>

<seg id="24">The winners of the winners belong to Hartwig Gauck and Harald Schmitt, the Freal Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Rudoka Frank Wieneke, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springfield Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the palballer Erhard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - that's both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitor are however with tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to be rather small in doubt and warns against such as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy and regulate the death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">By contrast, he would have been completely different, claims trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive regulators massively, and he makes himself strong for a wide-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain duties to meet, he has made of disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be more internal discussions on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive coal on the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil transport should also be possible in far protected areas to announce the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand renewable energies with their investment program, saying: "a country will create the clean energy and will create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazide trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both but not want to isolate the United States from international trade - rather than just US jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, for example Clinton calls.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage has to do, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to discharge the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics obey him, so that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, which at least of the wealthy wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When arriving in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her small son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He guarding with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starred on the table plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that she is watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the division's managing director of Contrbs, a carrier for social help in Bavaria, and among other things, with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are whispered.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North, one of the few decentralized accommodations for allued women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Contrbs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Day.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not available - even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a wax before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because they are torture or death, or because their families are sending them as hopes for Europe," she tells.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "many are taking away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honours, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, it continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, the tug for a bottle of water demand a sexual action, no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe once they are anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, the women in refugee camps were often regarded as mindery and worst misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women living in the north of the Munich, are traumatised, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women have been so familiar, that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the living, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not need to help, there is more accommodation only for them, requires Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they are using a similar project like in Munich in its condition, answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is something like the governments in accomodations of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, women are not separated from being separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press prepress of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Bavaria, sub- and middle-franken areas there are some shared floors or own houses only for women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of women and equality of the sexes" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published by the Committee, it means: "it is very important that men and women are separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or men are missing together, men and women can be accommodated, it may come to - persistent - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separately accessible and accessible to women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women sense this protective needs, you can read on Andres, which there is on the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"we've been talking about that there is a long queue," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">The assistant of the assistants called their union members to approve new workers in disputes with their disputes in terms of a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has demanded its entire Council to approve more labour measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">JDC told that there would be ministers to worry about the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, Assistenzologists and medical instigents have agreed to be agreed upon the rejection of a contract with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who have voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who was posted on Twitter on Thursday evening on Twitter, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt announced that the government would be quite calm on problems, which led to the contract that the contract was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "In view of what has the JDC Board tuned to completely reject the proposed new contract and concerns official new negotiations for all Estates."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC board appointed a formal motion for a special meeting of the BMA Council to start a running program of escalating work, which begins at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="10">Disputes listed that assistants took six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The leader of the BMA Registrar Dr. Johann Malawana, after the election of the agreed contractual conditions, had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to announce an official end of the eight months in the words of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the towel, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putting smiles worked very narrowly and he barely radiated heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of his "beloved friend" Putin - according to a report of all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved so that it would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that the head of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mention what he mentioned in his entry points: the downfall of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told Putin and accused Ankara to appeal Russia into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The surpassing was even larger, since it was committed by a good friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrw will be hard to rebuild, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the government-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time, the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies, he wanted to listen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of an armistice are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all the friends that he can get after finishing last month with a failed coup d'etat of his amber.</seg>
<seg id="28">The terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be relieved when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a late-seasonal anthroes of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week projected the state-TV cheaper fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this way: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, since its reaction to the attempted power supply was considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persisting resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the earnest on it is to pull out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state leader won a bonus in Ankara with security for the attempted coup d "état for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is true for Moscow, a matter of self-understanding, which even has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as it described me an analyst, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that stumbled from the west and are not treated so badly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nonetheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey assist.</seg>
<seg id="44">It may be indicative that after almost three hours of first call to the press conference, both presidents were saying that they didn't want to strive the topic once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey had intentionally responding to a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open enselections - and given the potential for a complete disaster than the NATO member Turkey rap the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads are talking at least again.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan distributed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="6">In this period brand new brand "RBS" have used to protect other end users.</seg>
<seg id="7">They supported the international sport with millions of pounds on Sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to focus more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland is available only for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, head office and stock exchanges to NatWest change.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ulster Bank's brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are others, smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB will become one of our investors, as well as the brand, under which our employees will be busy, as we are now more to a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS has been a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we do not pursue a global goals, but pursue local targets.</seg>
<seg id="17">Any of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these stamps with customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not be continued its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop the bank of brands, for how do we focus on inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the President of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">Three years ago it would have been very cynical when we said that we will be a great bank for our clients and have launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on client needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these brands again, so I think that the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="9">On the website of Kremlin, it's (in Russian) that he was later log-chief and head of directors of the governing probe.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state leader in terms of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian television station on Friday that IVANOV asked that IVANOV have asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step was mysteriously made in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey IVANOV was a long time one of the most closely trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the chief of Staff has resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile of smile for cameras, here are just a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as potential president once again to lead the Russian environment policy - joined large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin that are cited on the website of Kremlin, IVANOV said, "IVANOV said" it is true that I asked you to do this very complicated post - you could almost say - complying for four years to trust.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessibility Service (FSB), which was appointed to the KGB, was named IVANOV.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called IVANOV as one of five people, most of whom he confided.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was assumed that IVANOV could have been President of Russia after Putting the second term of President of Russia, as a third term in Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, seamless allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion costly project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the Norddeck of Queensbordered Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four seams of the "cover blowers," which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 scrapers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion costly project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of Queensborns.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used for this part of the bridge alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the shutter between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate work that require extremely precise tolerances for the pass.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total brückcks on their place and the last section of the Decks get a concrete kiss to the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor, said: "the first closure provides a considerable milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of future-proof high-quality and civil engineering represents.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the North tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very heats.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3% upwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heats, because the tolerances, which the team works, were tiny - on each side it was just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors have to be invested stronger in the duty of the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one responds to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "manual concept living" for the next plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann writes: "we are with the Green Party: who wants to build on urban areas in the future must be 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also arise in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big issue in the town hall was, however, Bratman: "how do you want to build investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new Municipal Building for residential construction programme, which will cost millions and has to be financed, should provide for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, the Bratman: "there is no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors a few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left aims to pay hardships for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, Bratman, bae a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the manual concept is implemented, that will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will receive skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program does not work completely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compares the loss of further around 1300 favorable flats, whose promotion is going to run out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning policy speech in Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, apartments would have to be thought again to get back into the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">One fell the problem for a blow.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western town run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this will not be the owner, the residential property societies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the west city is drastically increased, one removes the target of the so-called passage.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be still movement in discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">S & D Group president Holger Herlitschke writes: "for a vast majority, the CDU should have to go into the ship."</seg>
<seg id="34">The owners have been concentrating on more buildings for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child do not want to go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, in the last decade of many complains.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, people go to get people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen at the beginning was at the beginning of the TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and activities are not open to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I go to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app that is based on the characters that were created first for the video games in the 1990s (later a drawing series, playing cards, and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest sank in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved through the massive demand, which overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go had more users as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "can be captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, the Wahn joined and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase of steps that sets the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35.000 users, told the Washington Post that within two days after launch of the game, the number of people followed every day 30 minutes train, from 45 percent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public reconnaissance campaigns for health, people would like to take "themselves 30 minutes" to come "from the sofa," and "every day actively to be" beat on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look good.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can't be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drives sports, reduces its opportunities to ill cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making it fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürrical games, which must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run for a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphones apps like Fitbit earlier were able to follow our activity, they did not use any reason to play sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker success, there will be more games which will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will be combined in the real world and will be able to help many people on the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a majority title and a total of the fifth, while they make their reputation to be the best of their generation, or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears, when her final result was shown and her long journey had an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success shows them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominated her sport in the last three years - including 10 gold medals, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, who told us a mixture of ambition and precision that she said "the best thing that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a final examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I found myself under the Fraueniamship at the gymnasium and that from more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been at any Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three tower houses, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie," Hernandez, inspired for many young girls other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, the catholicin is complete, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has consolidated black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the past four years the number one was among the female Turnerves a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising debut in America and in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they expected unexpected, but masterful gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold for women with an individual prize event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of these sports type, but so you can't see gyms in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics are only four tournaments in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turnen is a more expensive sport and Turner first join in private Turnhalle that are maintained by parents, which will cost for training, educational, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the Turner will get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the Turnen.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to make the churches with countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a high-performance and easily accessible turnouts.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnout of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer a high-quality gymnasium who make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport art and benefit.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care for the tower and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" through the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thanks, Fass motivated her as many young girls with different background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you turn from the front or rear, this video will show you how you turn around the skewer for your predators.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you turn out from behind, then you should turn to the next, so that you can see your attackers and give them out of the Line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon from your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free ellbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knees into the serverste and turn, while the attackers with pain has collapsed, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backward, while they arrange the weapon upon him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers are moving forward, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun, seize the weapon and rotate it, so that the attackers cannot shoot.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and Würgereflex in a serious test by rejecting some of the dirty and most severe locations of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The host and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a Euro notes, a railing of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of any object, he used a Luminometer, to show and to show us what he will let.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment made under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing of a dryers which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely impervious, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of formulation and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he rejects, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known for this to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations up to washing up washing machines of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he said: "already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about what my health affects and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he deposed, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test screed showed a Luminometric range of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometric increased hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their Luminometric increased over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says, "This comes the worst thing I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll do nothing here, because it is inside ekelly here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will equip Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at the time and also explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We brought crazy Brainstormings that ended with that we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, when he had tasted some of the things I have asked him, such as the Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to attract them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on movie. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio conducted in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get nothing of the summer campaign together - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For so far as to date, it is not so far: summer holidays, heat and dayspring combat - which bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are convinced by the selfists are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the most holidaymakers, who are in the country, are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals who can't choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays, the helpers are hanging up, distributing posters, balloons, flyers, and out at the end of the voices, just to cast iron.</seg>
<seg id="9">Up to 4 September 2016, the electoral and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to rise again almost by the people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can tell at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting as strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of Koalitioning.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, spread roses and chises a little with the people, as it did already be legendary. Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors got cold feet and is chancellor Angela Merkel blunt the guilt of AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We are creating this" has accelerated the rise of spopoists, which is likely to cost him a beautiful office now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make the wrong time at the right place campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She was invited twice in Angela Merkel twice, Angela Merkel is in the north east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany, to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North-East CDU relied largely on market conditions and shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so cocaert, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union has also noticed that on the country the base is crumbled that they must be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are just like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the seback of the country hardly exists.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU campaign Kokert to his co-dispute is also self-deflection: "you must go there where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game stands, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the polls, S & D Group was last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just close to the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD still had won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, will give the jump into the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make holidays in need of modern virtue and put their electoral struggle on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" call the National Chair Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigns give to track censorship for local voice carriers among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the Spitzenkandidatin, kurted just with a houseboat by the mecklennia lakes and it also finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed, with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, beginning at 5.30 o'clock in the morning, and only at 20 o'clock, there is enthalable praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty much," Elvira Tetzlaff tells about the jet gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be moved to south end at the weekends until the end of October will be all ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The resolution is also praised for the construction of persons, such as it comes to the establishment of heating drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday to the south, and also the plunging of Aspergstrasse was lifted up in Ofterdingen and thus also the connection to Rottenburg are relaxed, the traffic situation is relaxed within the place.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now run from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The sojourn traffic by the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachestraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shots were seeking and rather their Navi confided as the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that, some trucks in residential areas were franked.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limbs have not been observed, the congregation demanded the knives from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was considerable injuries," says King, who himself was able to feel very much about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The high-speed freewheel was on the pace of 77 km / h in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">But since the construction site has moved on, it was now calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg are now open the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the cards, businessmen are not willing to look.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, that the B 27-refurbishment has led to them in revenues, everybody asks you to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some people are affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have to do with the "end customers" have less to do so for other companies, for which the restructuring has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "no less decline," but also dreaming that of course, "the drive is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The Local along the street are the strongest farms.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly known crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not just him, but all the restaurants I met "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">They were missing the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every euro.</seg>
<seg id="32">On "far more than 50 per cent of the sales were applied.</seg>
<seg id="33">Road lubrication took his operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his collaborators have to be released.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, governing president Jörg Schmidt could be given to a request by Göhner, whether there would be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant has benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now they have to carry out the disadvantages which result in the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where there was so much more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business was set up here since 1715, he refers to the long history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now foreseeable because of the complicated transport management less frequently, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If one can't go back, it is also quite nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his pedigreentators declined again after the end of restoration work, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long-term history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the name of the terrorist fighting in law, it is constantly screwed.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent proposals, Interior Minister de Maizière now establishes a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a Dulce status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière announces the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically acceptable," says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not demand anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Others, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also felt about it, too.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the Minister of Interior, however, was involved in results and at a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière had left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some is known already announced, announced that a new security authority to worry about the crack-encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also, not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU directives for passenger data and arms.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies are also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the part, de Maizière launches a second cross country for proposals that had not been able to do with the SPD: he wants a sympathizing for terrorist groups under sentence and heads with double citizenship the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"these are difficult points for the SPD," grants the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">It nevertheless, however, does not stop this for reasonable and demands nothing, which does not have any chance at the coalitionist.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presented by de Maizière too.</seg>
<seg id="20">They partly in themselves: he plans fast-rules for deportation and more possibilities for detention from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees that are fetched targeted in the country, should check their smartphones and make social media accounts for a security check exam.</seg>
<seg id="22">For asylum seekers, he wants to make some more worse than ever - such as such, the criminal offences or their papers deliberately throw away their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">This also works unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points, in the inequality of thought, for example - the question arises: what does it really have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between topics refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people rose worries about security in view of the great number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that were deeply involved in people, had not left off again in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The safeguarding is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">In regard to the issue of inner security, Union and SPD are increasing increasingly in position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past days there was high between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">First, a garriser dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a safety-olitical ideas collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the Ressorts also demand a Burka prohibition and a return from double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière, too, is proud to be reconciled sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the double pass, he's nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">You are reinvent, be not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a Burka-Ban, he discerned the constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is unconstitutional at all corners and whether it actually is "zumable," it is still necessary to show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in it that could take care of war.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD also attempts to profiling the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signalized only a cautious conversation and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security of security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Even Volkswagen glimping is coming through.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite diesel fuel, the payroll are increasing worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not in all markets it runs around.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a term in the response to the response.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts out by deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-run markets, Europe's biggest car park can continue to be a plus.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand VW faced its core brand, especially in Western Europe and thus loads the total sale, like that in the Dax notated companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, the deliveries fell by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July, especially on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, in some core markets, it has been given a purchase order in some key markets.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote have also been burdened by the EU, explaining a narrator.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the emissions of gas was first calculated, another minus is also being beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Major support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony, in further glimping through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, merely an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3,37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sales of the Fred Kappler was able to continue selling a sales plan from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated Volkswagen with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls approximately 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of rearmament, VW reiterated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After rearmament of vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor capacity.</seg>
<seg id="23">The car will present the customer after the upgrade of a "guaranteed" certificate, but did not speak of a "guarantee" as it was on Friday in the group of business.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason: legal habits are.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen has now granted its German customers a guarantee for around diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This last Monday, VW-representatives of the Federal Ministry of Transport has been confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Transport, it was confirmed that there were this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has fulfilled the editions of my Inquiry Commission and the KBA system."</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations are not accepted," declared Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or motor power after the conversion will not take place, and have unchanged any typical vehicle values unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen himself uses the term "guarantee" but did not know how it was in business affairs.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come to a workshop half a year after the upgrade, and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in customer interests, it is important to avoid that in any other damage we have nothing to do with the crash scandal that comes to a violation of possible warranty rules, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is why you do not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination panels: who buys sound plates actually?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to oversaw him under the pseudonym non-Alleenvy's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the complex reconstruction of sound plates is not on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the latest of physical objects, but due to midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have purchased a record recently, are all preview after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely waste group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through Hobbysamming - it has an emotional meaning: older record players keep your feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I am in the midst of a bustling street in Soho, a modest grey suit, and wild booming before I stand to hold my hands and determinate something like: "so let us take a further look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos slowly carries its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialist.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera to the next part, in which I stand in immediate proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate her age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I spoke of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men mean age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men mean age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed by home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records, which he could not afford, than they appeared and again selling items that he sold when he was young and plexed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believe that many customers who meets with the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the mediator, people who have heard about comeback and set up their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks I have led, people usually have offended their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to attachments of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as phonica, to realise that record shops offers a calm community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to stability of trusted sound platforms, from objects that are happy to be happy with joy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or ownership of material possessions as a sort of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors so and I think it's so much in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered a staff from a plate stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM revealed in April that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month is not yet to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, have no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would look very worried while I am a piling of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men mean age), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revive.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came up recently here and said," I have no turntables, but I'd like to buy a radio record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicous.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who first come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an open audience when I cleansed.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops, Wild Beasts of the novel synthesis, instead of experimental jazz pampered from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversatility at the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but brand psychic traumas are hard-able, if one stands for someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for some minutes in the business and considered the Varietrics for the sale of the plates.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a manneboxer as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so the collectors of records are not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a loved groaning.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am trying to scroll the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young girls who think for a moment about Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think to buy a crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to hold them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects may mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my researches revealed that the results of YouGov, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday tomorrow with safety not with the boasting through record transactions of the Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they flattered the stubborn view of an uncanny, 30-year-old presenter that rises above the shoulders of the middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisorical stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week the authorities argued that the state should be allowed to dismantle 72 provisorical business in which persons offer goods or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisorical restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups, not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provising business, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are completely retraceable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as only people live "living in extremely premise conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of calm encounter between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>

<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain in the 7-year-old Rugby came to a rupted stop at the final hurdle at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were smitten with a result of 43-7 in Dev Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji had a master class in Handling, Side-Stepping, press back, line-run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympiad every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed by the not too bad consolation prize of silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boat, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But rather, in this form, in this form a 15-man team would have been defeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a solace for GB - but it will probably not mean that at least one tenth day will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis Head trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This strap is weary, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and made the GBS of fun off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you walk in driving buses. the World Series winners went to top 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau left in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly added the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hot Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa stopped to achieve a third gate, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua took a touch down and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preached by more weak tacings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as in Fiji had been born to play 7, while GB were still allowed.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in basic changes to half-time and completed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova was running after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favour of the South Sesulans, whose fans sang, Fahnen turned and danced on the bundle.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful role of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the i-dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff tweeter, Fijis embraced and the GB was severely beaten to the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated the semi-final with 20-5 in the semifinals and the United Kingdom brought South Africa in a shortage match from the race - UK transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown launched the Boke in the first half, but Dan Norton broke out the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late-late Tactics of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside teams, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="3">From the first strolling up to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the applause that were sitting on the Ruff, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympics without control woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter are unsafe, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete who glide about the surface with the elegance of vibrations, which is not reflected the type of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion to those who make the difference, which make the difference and it was no more helpful than the trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediability of victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who made a nerves in the morning, spent a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only repeating me how much I and Helen and Robin worked together with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we wouldn't be a massive Thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to coaching or want a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents were unable to compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams started to start from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out of making something new.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to do no fireworks today, we just wanted to score a good result, going out and win the race which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>

<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure means.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: singing for Seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, teaching positions. she sings the subject of music, and today the 78 year old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Very next door, they are doing something good in her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler by the German Senior School League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular merger, senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently, social and family structures in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "to address and organize, to learn from each other and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of compositions."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler mean.</seg>
<seg id="12">They exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who calls his lungs regularly, is not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common Singen had a much higher job value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people often weave many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and especially melodies themselves demenated people relying for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to the head, a special performance is required, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on their own voice and focus on a predetermined rhythm - which is a large cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, practice their own, not only concentrate on itself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that man learns through the singing in the choir, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is growing through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I do long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - with 50 singing people who listens to it, if a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different ways, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing someone from the acquaintance in a veteran enchynel, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who would like to sing in a church choir, directly to the church or the church stand.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior schools can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Whoever does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever wants to sing, should always be connected to a choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something fascinating - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will then increase again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an extensive calculation, the sanitation price in Azendorf is going to be 4,37 Euro per cubic meters.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor of Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported the approval of the budget by the country, and Kulmbach found that for these sewage plants will continue.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities covering the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Starting from 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial factories are from Welfare, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg down deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt showed a new calender of the fees necessary for sewage plants of the market community.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, survivors from the previous calculation period are to be accounted for.</seg>
<seg id="10">In all three sewage plants, Schmidt established that there are relatively small sewage plants with a very low sewage plant, which lie between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for more than one thousand Euros would be serious.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, sanitation is slightly declining in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, the period of calamation period in all three systems were not least last because of their age sanitation and repair applications in a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage plant Azendorf had to be replaced on mechanical vents due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Pumpy Welfare had to be overhauled by almost 20 years of old conveyors. after almost 20 years of operation the first clamping pond has had to be installed, the sewage sludge disposed of, and an additional ventilation option to be installed in order to be able to hold the water standards in future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "for these extraordinary expenditures, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are considered to be considered in the new calculations period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made clear that low sewerage in the three facilities increased its expenditures for the operation and maintenance. "</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs were spared in the sewage plants over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to remain in general, especially since we could not expand the supply of sewerage-purpose Friesenbachtal for these installations because it is declassified facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensibel towards races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool it enables Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already known to the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into an pineapple, a dog or a piece which could be from a Roy Lichtenstein paintings.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unflower, independent tools which generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All failure to the public arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app will propel Blackface to beat or white skin as a beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When these week some Users proposed a filter which gave them sleepers, false teeth, and ruined cheeks, they called some critics a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowly."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repetitive controversy fell to a larger problem, that the company has diversatility.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat took it that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as homage to Anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsider, the racissmus experienced, reminded the filter of violating clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decided to decide the anime-comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student, whose names were widely used over the photos that the filter "violate and mildly was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very resistible Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yelash of yellow was pulled down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration ampf, of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are in the race of various other players - could expect rather out, sensibility to expect.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats felt a picture, it is much more difficult to remember that such things remain unnoticed when it was earlier, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided that as a product manager and engineers, Zhu decided to erase their Snapchat account for others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial-related controversy has a lack of diversatility at the adjusting practices in Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # Delracce Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either have they no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so that they can make such decisions," or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions, in which they are safe or comfortable to say about it. "</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint which has left the Snapchat mostly unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company has not published numbers to diverging his workforce, and shows its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff, but according to a microphone, the company has recently set a staff responsible for undergoing population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Allied members of the United States Central Command modifiable information to draw a optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual states to place locally in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Services Committee and Wehrbudgetary Reports, reported by large discontent under Central Command Secret Services, reported how to change their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"news service information, which were typically approved by high-level CentCom commansions, recorded a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it permitted the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," quote a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The guide errors in CentCom will stretch up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report clearly shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct hints to change reports that government tops have been given under Obama statements, it shows how analysts at the pressure of their precurses were exposed to draw a optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements before the Congress were clearly reflected in the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom members publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls can already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second-largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Kansas City, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's headquarters changed the downstream reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after giving them, analysts concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, more investigations of CentCom Reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Defense Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence agency published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 CentCom developed an overly restricted process for the preparation of engineering assessments on Isil and the Iraqi security services," a member of the House of Representatives for Adam B. ship, known in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, such as Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of subsequent reports," the morality among analysts and "were overly little space for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats stated that there were no evidence of any intervention of the White House with CentCom analysts at a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times of investigations were reported by the Pentagon of the Pentagon, which were surveyed by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press preacher of the Pentagon, gave no reports to the Ministry of Defence, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have very difying opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion of this important topics of the National Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (one assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year, however, have thrown out the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds about the Islamic State of the German government as an CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, who looked at the recommendations of many analysts at the time of many analysts at the time of many analysts and have little time to make the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker played a key role in insurrection against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker filed an indication of government officials, that there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, because these provisorical refineries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this realization was not published, the Times in September.</seg>

<seg id="11">Bam was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years in his hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as they couldn't qualify for the cades.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the subsequent year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work party in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have shed the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback from the middle range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory at the tournament in the game, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the play stand from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam playing the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">They did a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to get a 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of all the tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had so far had to book a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we're in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on Saturday's result.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro's events are constantly growing and unavoidable, a shaving relay between competition and streetables.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is to protect from the wristband to the swimmers for the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue at the queue, without Simone Biles, Katie Lewery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of swarm, could have been sent to the Prime Time, constructed by sponsors and welfare-TV ads, if it would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade, the sports that are not universally accepted: airgun shoot, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when I want to make a modest arguments for my particular darling, let me get the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the Trampolinjump already has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so sparsely perceived that many who had questioned, did not know that it is a Olympic port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and had a athlete up until 2012, which made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Trampolinjump has some outer side charme, partly because it sounds for the uncleared ear suitable for a clownsschule than those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonic tremor of his never-to-end pruning - but also the Grazie of the Turntable and divers, the two sports that were essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means something like "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ascend winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a range of falling movements (turning, hgenuine and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic program, you will be assessed according to design, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete in Rio on each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists hopes in their pursuit to gold, quicker, upward and beyond, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV broadcast also another modestal goal: the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I'm trying to see this games as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a breath.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she pondered, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes down, then downwards, then effortless again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves enter the distance, only the dreaming, elegant raising of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifier and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will cut the final round as part of a afternoon block on two days from 2pm.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can only be reached by the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley expects his after air rind, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested in Ethiopia, Long, the United States of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia are calling on violent opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that some protesters were killed during clashes with police with police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia turning together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid consortium of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But protests against the government in recent months shook the country and spread out more areas in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave up that policemen shot down and killed police unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, some videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security sleepers suggest young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The UN Committee for Human Rights now demands an incoming examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of International Crisis Group, a Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians in order to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy continues to expand in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new Pendition train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia were all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly continued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents were effectively brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or imprisoned in prison, or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, that cover everything from the ground level up to the worms in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After an extended election last year, the ruling party and its allies gain the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this tender, controversial line demanded hundreds of life in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced out more or less in recent years, could use turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the probiting after years of fear will now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved by Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government does not lock access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies, hiding place where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave up that they were gathered together to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äonen, the Amharas, the predominantly Christian flooding, come out in the politics and the economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu said, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that account for around 6 percent of the population and the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-sealed illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially realising in it, early signs of dissatisfaction perceive and make special contractors to edit enemies and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on this principle," Mr Abdi said, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen out of relatively unattended reasons to take the status of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he enjoys not the confidence of the security services of the Tigray security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced an uproar in 2005 after thousands of elections were protested by the government and subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razcia, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last few months and this time of turbulence went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendition train, as well as for its measurable progress in the poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this does not prevent the Intensification of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, led by Tigray, and hatred toward the Tigray will always be more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights via the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to be united in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin slide."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday to overthrow his campaign by repeating his several repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group of Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification began new questions about communication skills of the presidential candidate of Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellowways to take an effort to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain the real position, which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After graduating at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really not intended to signify, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morsel on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">As opposed to the previous day, Mr. Trump in a series of interviews said he said the excuse perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement somewhat, that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican Presidential candidate did not want to know anything.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critique on Mr. Trump descending, while he tried to control the focus of his campaign due to falling fluctuations on economic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clint's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism as he said that the Russians should dice Mrs. Clint Emails, but later he said, "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then back to ruders.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive, and then if needed," "Ruth Sherman, a communication experts who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his testimonies, so they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even corrosive tone since its rfracture has gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he accuses his critics frequently to unite his statements or humour humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps kidze his loyal Mitstreites into the uncomfortable situation to him, regardless of how provokant may like his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocate advocate, gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said that he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense, that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her back-bysters, completely false, and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most Mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the government served as Foreign Minister in Mrs. Clinton to spread ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East, under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them out on any of his words and to be voiced.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor, unuberful" TV experts who try to understand and said, "You can't!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats spends over Mr. Trumps excuse as a further evidence that he was inappropriate for the presidential Office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a playful café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi but for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop was pushed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Buy Soap Cherie's business in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the shape of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals mourned as last loss in a genetically modified town.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it is also new one.</seg>
<seg id="8">A animated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafés.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working with Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new external power, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment with experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are yarns like capers and sautious onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is nature spirits.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café is no beer more, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a stacked electricity to old tribe customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed through Williamsburg prices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after Greenpoint was drawn, she would take the way forward.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the Verb had closed, she gave a while the coffee tines, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture of the Verb, which pleased me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if they had iced a blended Chai Tea in this day instead of their usual iced coffees, who is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and ordered it to be the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal gets still his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he didn't heground about that the soap business has taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">Indeed, the owner of the Soap Cherie has to produce a special soap for Verb with the cold brewed coffee of coffee bars as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go to their offer," said Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into the Polish language and Rodriguez said that he proposed to stop them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local saftlocally wants to fill the cold brewed coffee to the bottles and sell.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands to neighboring buildings.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many clients, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground, when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that the location of the Lokas and the Order felt a new coffee like a homecoming.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a abundant meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a foodies, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined Delicatessen the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland waterplates soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was something modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a pudpudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with people" said Jane Zckman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted by the Chinese cuisine in the US, while the bricks in their book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a home house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, snowy snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the IPcrash of 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Zckman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese andoned with olivenstückchen, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato purée and vegetable salad.</seg>
<seg id="12">When reporters ordered hackers, this was suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were extremely popular," said Zbriman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, meat cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must be placed in the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male Feldares and it was served fresh pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans that sent food to an hungering Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" draws the ways to which the country went on, no longer meant to be the Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in which food for the Americans became a central, anged topic," I was buried, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new Budgeth was the same as the new budgets: mysterious foods such as breads and keepers have been given to basic food, the casserole as a "wonderful way, eating remains rewarding," there could hide very appetizing ingredients under a creeping sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat that had been the centre of the American kitchen for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends were tried, as a calorie rich and nourish satisfaction was precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, a court made a court of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition of the midday," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Brick continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for the home business concept.</seg>
<seg id="32">As ever before or ever since, business economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - eating habits of the country so much.</seg>
<seg id="33">In making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become a "householder women" and the challenge to transform Pampe as cremige spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historical leakages.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports about the response of the government to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-Essen attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant cuisine of his kitchen, he spells like the millionaire-heavy man from the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber", "Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a almost gold-gold dining room and carried a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delicious realistically.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor urged him to static his stomach with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the cultivation of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Ms. Roosevelt took that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most likely to be prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, to cope with food was discarded as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, strife said, as well as science was applied to food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclist is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haxia are usually only in the winter for the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland just got up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In common, the Greenland-shark on the bottom of the North Atlantic along, in an hour he gets on average 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it depends, the five meter long animal accelerates a whopping 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed, half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This characteristic of loneliness, however, seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least from Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Schedlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock is this life expectancy that means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland's sharks are stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to watch, finally they live in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they would water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland-haxia according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timelpento looked like her, when they took six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey do these sharks: in the stomach of an animal found researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the jaw bones of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and looking for cadaver, who are spread out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, the fisherman between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502-cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the shareholding of the sharks with the Carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye-lens arises before the birth of the sharks, which contained proteins later no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts to drag larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 220 centimeters length of the third slightest animal, the linoleic acid contained a low excess of carbon-14 out of nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all larger Greenland-haxia had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">The carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the Record-Hai with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlandhai females then get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign up an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined, Grönlandhaie is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live especially in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The old record holder, an 211-year old Greenland wal, caught a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures often the organism of living animals live in savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should concentrate on to concentrate as many offspring as possible," says the Evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, however, should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">"it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtstein, head of the competence of competence and real estate markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London's financial transactions throughout the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU-passport to them the approval in the UK has so far enough.</seg>

<seg id="16">In addition to the Seine, the tenants for top-quality commercial real estate is by 50 percent higher than the main one.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less criminality.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the company consultancy Mercer, the city is located at No. 7, Luxemburg on No.19 and Paris on No.33 and Paris on 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if quality of life is a question of preferences, "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW is follicated.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots has unleashed a media clock after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed any Israeli prefix as it had requested Arab guests according to a employee. "</seg>

<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel at the list of the hotels.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed in the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany's new Germany, it is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an option to choose Israel via an own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he received there, "he shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason that stood behind, he dissolved even more anger in the director.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner raste last night in the men team-Sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took hold of the anchors who had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. the party and made legend proudly as he shocked home to take a victory of the New Zealand New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after taking place in March at the train world championships in London despite the backdrop of Hoys, only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to tried Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they remained when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner sat in the qualifying round of a Olympics, but in the standard round the New Zealand celebrated the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Passing away after his round, Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic change made a large proportion of transformation, in the execution in a higher speed to slow down it and it Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC Expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympic champion in the Endrunde and defeats the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the page of Kenny and Hoys, Hinder gave to the railway after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no problem for this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hinder said, "It feels like the whole GB of flags on the bundle of London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've been so bad in so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which have won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we expect to be successful five days in the velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibilty that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheme of Hoy is equal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint's Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hinder said, "If he gains two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallible competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brave Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first round and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where the Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">In yesterday, he fought against the qualification round of qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women competition that continued tomorrow and finished, avancated Laura Trott, Joanna Rowousel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archisoon of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played drama in the background, leaving the resignation of the technical Leiters Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sex and Mobbingpreferences as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite afterwards, then the legendary reputation GBS, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">The future of the melting of Portland, due to raising the energy agreement</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of alschmelts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game, as the plant driver will announce the energy supply contract, and thus will raise all delivery contracts, as the supplier of energy companies rejected.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate.</seg>
<seg id="4">The payout is scheduled for 20 years in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the Alcoa plant in Portland are available on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could occur to dominoes, since the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting pot which led to a closing of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked a lockout.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the installation.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL who supplies the large aluminum car with its Loy Yang A power plant in LatAm Valley, it proceeds that three other owners will leave their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, including the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller parts.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland, which means another physical demand for power by the melting pot," divided the company with.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continues to be announced that the contracts called "hedging transactions" were supposed to have entered into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"from henceforth, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues," said the supplier of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointment markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL told that the value of contracts had already been written in the amount of $187 million in anticipation of termination. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcohol... can operate the melting pot or the power supply to the melting pot."</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that there have been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still a explanation, why it has been resigned by the Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analyst warn thanks to the bad economic conditions of the sector in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumption approximately 900 megawatts each year.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand in the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a generator, this would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">More than just one Kardashian reality-TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vosue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managist and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted septet issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people who I love, the sight of this covers brought me to weeping," wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the Covers followed a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz-Oncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as it ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents virtually every birthday of a children's return (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You would like that we should have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a drawing edge at 8 o'clock in the morning) but Kris had to participate in the publicity at this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the cardashians started.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's sister Kim likes her that the Vogue cover is concerned (they and their husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is available for Vogue most in the most sold issue of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a fashion journal than a fashion magazine, the output resembles a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the kit (615 pages of advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his codec is expected to be hooked in recent two years before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the past few years, more "celebrities, the modeling" as "models, the famous ones are" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2013, Oscar-Prize laureate and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner is described by the magazine as the "Disrupture model" of its generation - under the former category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to play a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to each denominator).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had been one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners don't like success.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV history, Jenner's position was always impaired in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleagues in Gigi Hadid criticized them. "</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings come up again, when the message came out with the show Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But riding on the misfortune seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vosue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your base of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all her sisters sell you pictures from their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells from her made pictures of Cindy Crawfords daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is on the reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="7">In Farrell, Farrell said that the government would only be even worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">"QueensScotland Municipal centers are chronically underfinanced, meaning thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relations, people with unmistakable and repressing debts, families who have been released through separations, workers who have been wrong - all those people have problems rightly and this survey will not need the help you need.</seg>
<seg id="10">In June 2017, the federal government will reduce the average of 30 percent, which means thousands of helpful people from Queensland to be forced to maintain their legal problems without any aid.</seg>
<seg id="11">We demand the General Prosecutor and Federal State Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately lift this medium term immediately, so that people may need the help they need to receive legal problems.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in Timlupe: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came onto the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today the successors dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning, the built-in memory was eight megabyte, this would be sufficient for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigabyte.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euros enthusiasts can buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in the western part format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new cell phone was able to receive a lot of: SMS and emails were sent and received, also by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, even quitting slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could use in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has been different since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone map of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disinaster, was finally sold to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market dominate today, which all came up much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>

<seg id="32">He talked three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communications, everything by touch screen is easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">The victory of Apple began, even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the reviewing.</seg>
<seg id="35">They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Sagen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>

<seg id="5">And that will be back, by creating new opportunities for local and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities there are already 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs are creating and youth unemployment in the airport environment are preparing an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, there will be such that they will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will fade on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The branch had no wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answered any question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a lot and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a possibility to create up to 180.000 new jobs, £211 billion to grow growth and a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow who has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, which was built in the middle of the two frequented catwalk in the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we expand this olympic spirit and create Heathrow as well as our future trade, and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies working with onlineage money, according to one of the software manufacturing attempts to handle advertising block, a "Katz- and Mausoleum."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that there would block advertisers on his desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which it claims that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook told that his desktop page would change the coding page on its advertising, in order to identify advertisers which is part of the advertising is to be harder to difficult.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that there has found a new way to handle new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blogpost, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams, that "this kind Hin-and-Her struggle between the tempting open source community and the converters have already been under way since the invention of advertisers in progress," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest companies have settled in the fight is a strong indiz that has become a strong indian indication for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study published by the last year of Pafair and Adobe, some 200 million people will use advertisement; almost four times so much in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police calls on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday had suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman placed herself in the dark "in an act of despair" on the road and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49, which was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, was to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died before place.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some are still not identified yet, the police said these as well as every witness of the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was opened an investigation procedure which is a "logical" step in such a situation divided by Gilles Hofstetter the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoids?</seg>
<seg id="12">That is something that the prosecutor must decide, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark on the highway ran - was decided that drivers do not assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policeman of neglectic killing was acquitted when they had taken a man and killed one night at the A1 in the vicinity of Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old sacrifice had drunk, and has become unconscious of the street, and took the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court determined that the policeman had responded to an emergency call -- to justify a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should be aware of the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms, which resembles those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, water-loose surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have been exposed to similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously mentioned that the slow reverse of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin, erect-like atmosphere, and still progressed slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry places than the Earth, but had once spread enough water and geographic variability to accomodate life and shake off faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was about 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the long rotation of Venus exponates its day side of the sun almost two months long," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a rains to remove the surface of a large part of sunheat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus, which resembles evolution that was suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably resident, Venus -- over the course of several billion years, was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evapsed and their water vapor was burned down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When you moved to Hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers gave the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler's dream telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates under the stars of the starbase of the Pleyades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars in the starbase at different rates, as well as in which connection the rotational periods are available with the planet level.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the comparing of our results with other stars, Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The starbase of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, can now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now rotating on the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At top rotating rates, these mature stars encounter large quantities of asterwinds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds are travelling through the stars of stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aligned, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizes the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- as sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalog of rotational rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less than massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with a larger stars slower pirouettes turn smaller than smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleyades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster Rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the starboard of the Pleyades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities like rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the starboard of the Pleyades is an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still a lot about how we want to know more about how, when and why stars are slow down their rotational rates, so to speak their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the projades of the Pleyades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in the best days of Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional release announcement, the 41-year-old pro will bear his New York Yankees for the last time on 12 August.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye' to teach," the 14-time All-Star-Game-participants of the Major League Baseball (MLB) stated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the Yankees the World Series.</seg>
<seg id="7">His subtitle under a ten-year contract signed him 27 million dollars annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the contrast on December 31, 2017, he served as a consultant and youth coach - at full content.</seg>
<seg id="9">As players, Rodriguez paid long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 Homerus, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 he made a number of milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only have two more baseball players in the most important statistics of similar values.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the 41 year-old is not yet to be recorded in the fame hall of the baseballs.</seg>

<seg id="14">In 2009, the Superstar was delivered to "ESPN," between 2001 and 2003, prohibited steroids to have taken place.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was locked up to 211 games following an execution in the so-called Biogenesis scandal at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspect for years to have received performance over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a lawsuit, the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the league could even have been a pleasure for the year 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at that time.</seg>
<seg id="19">His farewell-days are not noiseless.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends had once again received the big stage again, Rodriguez needed to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"my job does not include farewell tour."</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official dates.</seg>
<seg id="4">An experienced athlete could have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">In front of the seventh competition day, the first official dates of the Rio de Janeiro became known in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimming pool in Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle in Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinsky were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the Athletics Contests, these messages come to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the last Sunday the diuretic of hydrochlorothiazide had been detected last Sunday, which is used as a masked means of doping substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sportcourt CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games in Friday.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds, it missed the Bronzemedaille.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have to attend the qualification over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen has requested the opening of the B-Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">The National Association take the matter "very serious and demands of Chen full cooperation with the research," zitioned Xinhua from a message: "we will be working with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news about the positive test at Danekowa, the 33-year-old also went into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this is "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it should act with the banned substance to deal with the blood dopingagents EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was temporary suspended, according to BNT, the B-Trial also should have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately applied to word with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes don't move the right slabs," he said, "We are on observation, so many are already excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus, about all weightlifter from the nation's chronically dopingated nation can not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinsky" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz tested three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Taking both the taking, they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, Danekowa is another severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association had signed the entire Russian team up to a exception because of systematic deopings, also the Läuge Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the previous version in China had also triumphed in China for heavy disputes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is how the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to pass," Lacourt said in French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, Sun stood at the centre of a meditation on Australians Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for doping blockers," said this.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datalogy: so perfide presses her delaying money</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of replacement malware: currently targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have at least once, partially several victims of attack with compressors software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a Ransomware press.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willingly from the poles required to take advantage of the required systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their compressors software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potency can be considerably higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of pollutants," says Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to cover advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the perpetrators software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private use was the goal, but the change to company attacking took place in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once installed on the computer an account, they are specifically looking for unlong modified files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the compressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to receive the final turnkey code, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where with private use the personal photo-database is on the game, it's about companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage fall from when a Ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies contracted sales by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the business activity completely, in case of a case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already being threatened by attacks in Germany, whose patients can be threatened with loss of acute symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 per cent of the firms pay, pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in light of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers from F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will individuals be saved after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must part hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware reprint, hackers are becoming professional and share the work, explained security experts from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">The more likely it is, however, that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software package to the real press pressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors then search for further hackers, to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the underground, redeeming the set of one criminals and tasked another to install the software on as possible as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inadequately calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then contribute to spread with spreading," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that ensure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of the companies responsible in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware via file-back-ups and scannersoftware can be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data only is no sufficient threat to successful pathogens, the perpetrators instead contacted with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or quotations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential depending on the type of data, about a multiple times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could have completely new goals on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference, defensive security researchers demonstrated how to get to their control with the Internet-connected thermostat.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the non-shift of a derart blocked heating so much sacrifice is definitely worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole factory road instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday dust</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1,60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the Fond, it doesn't work closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the Interior are well processed and act pleasant, only the cockpit-top is falling there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only a trunk of 453 l is available at high-quality and 1026 l, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">That is less magical than it sounds: the seat of the back bench can be set up like chin-up and offer storage space, which is from the floor up to the ceiling of 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot room can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp is accelerated the HR-V thanks to torque torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to refrain his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is still another powertrain: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering is likely to be a bit direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quality variant "Executive" has no wishes to be desired in the tested top version "Executive."</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems belongs to the City emergency assistent (process up to speed 32), the collision system and the trace assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sometimes the collision was irritated sometimes because he rated many obstacles in the rankings as "drawing objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote assistance work is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart tempt react to the traffic sign detection and drosselt at need the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity exists only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI jack are under the armrest and therefore something awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 Euro for the well-equipped top-diesel engines are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel starting from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and open-day car.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening there are forever around, at night you can wake up hours, in the morning it is not far from wake up to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is concerned with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent do their sleep often or permanently as a relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and it can be underlying the causes of them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleepers and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the Insomnie, thus a single and sleep problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In just this, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, the board member of the German homework association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel, says Jens Wagenknecht.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychic or behavioral factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often frequent in depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors want to thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can't be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and starts blurable, over all day problems and take care of saling, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep problems to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week and should be affected by day, the doctor should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: it is disrupted, tired, irregular, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical symptoms such as stomach and headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, there are behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases, and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there are hardly any kind of sleep specialist in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fionger, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should first contact with sleep problems at the dentist, the weeß is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem may clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">To study in sleep laboratory rates, for example in snoring with breathing, in disease-day fatigue, in bedbugs or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder, Fiona explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says fixation.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling, one goes into the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to electrodes on the body one carries a nose-goggles, chest strap and an antennas at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, a camera displays the sleeping on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches where you can place for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß is on: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, not too long in bed, not watch TV to sleep, alcohol avoid drinking and at night not at the clock - then you start at once, and that's quite and certainly not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altconstructions, a few linking stalks, in between yet another headstone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain operates at the first glance, but the police force them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from the east to the west, one gets on toys, refreshed kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house someone has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl which will soon be demolished, it is already built: by 2017, there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate agency Friedrichshain calls, however, preferred by inflammable cars in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents of lease income, on the ground floor are occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, in the beginning of the year, handle left for a hard time the police against the project pronounced, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrol the police for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three club cars on site, locked parts of the road and kept visitors off to enter the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, newly renovated building workers in order of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration of the Berlin administration decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers went down under the youth of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer morning the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others keep in front late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hood, a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main care of many local people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who draws up three children here, are mainly driven by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the hood, they share the concern before increasing rying and genetic engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who prejudice a majority of policeman in front of vandalding left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensator and the police set up between the owners and their neighbours, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which is even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also household appliances and the native residential projects include a long time to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by former German GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the maintainers were cleared under large police officers, many of the projects were legalised within the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become the magnets for tourists and election liner from around the world: with them, people from East Germany's times and former Hauser preserved their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable by the renters, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you recognize them on designed discs or freshly painted facades that were used with stainings.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year so often with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this, that not all neighbours may view the problem, it might be that they are not necessarily concerned by criminality: crimes such as body injuring statistics, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the alleged offences make nondamage caused by the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house beside the controversial 94 years, the uncertainty cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence is concerned, they are complaining: the people in 94 are their neighbours, those who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are even longer in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, its street is not a criminal combustion point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and get more each other than one another."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the residents will return to their streets: by the police, politics and the media, all in July all suddenly occupy the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents, as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by hundreds of constructions in former building blocks, that push the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately ownership apartments that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well-known," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I absolutely not guidate."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if someone does not listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is also frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For listeners who like more than coloured bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the hood projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who go behind, should be aware of him - just like someone who attracts to a pub area where you can easily complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioned for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as contacts for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer from the working group indicates that the honours are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the jealous Wollmilchsau, which has a problem especially.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked as much as rather on the multitude of advances are targeted - meant that the administration wanted to write the passage.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administration company with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long experience in the field of social work, just a jealous Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with the people on site and also behind the scenes, as well as networks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with us for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle Ehren- and official players are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New Container in the Wasstrasse are available soon.</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for the connection of volatile agents who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">In charge of the connection, the municipalities are in charge.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must undertake the refugees in your own or rented areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovations of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the estate community, community service and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration doesn't find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Not so far, it was not possible to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments have to be checked, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster, do-profit work - and that's motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that work for the community has a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is no employment therapy. "</seg>
<seg id="35">It does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a courge feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So there are also administration and honours here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it takes and take time to survive the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who sometimes feel the feeling that he could not work in Urbach, must not work, and be unprofitable, which will never be integrating.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">The problem is also, however, says the customer honestly, "people in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two were afraid of radicalization, even in a small congregation like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine Customer says quite clearly, "which can call manger naiv." a residual risk could and can't exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents have also been the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the assassadors came out completely into custody.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So far, main and honourable site must look forward in the region and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new impact of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clear to answer, the policy turned.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place her helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there, where we would like to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been fully utilized to incorporate the previous human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young males.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women are lonely.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
